Russ Mould from AJ Bell believes that's why this Black Friday will be scrutinised even more closely. He also believes that despite Friday's bounce on Wall Street AI bubble fears haven't gone away but that rising hopes for an interest rate cut are justified. For more live coverage of the markets, watch the full episode of Market Sunrise and visit Yahoo Finance.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nwill help us dig a bit further into what's coming up this week and much more. I'm joined by Russ Mold, investment director at AJ Bell. Russ, thanks so much for joining us.\n\n00:07 Speaker A\n\nWell, let's start with the Fed. Uh, you know, the probability of a Fed rate cut has now risen. I mean, last week I was talking about 30%, 33%, and now it's at 75% according to the Fed Watch tool. Um, what do you make of what we heard from the New York president, a Bank of New York president there? And also whether you do believe the markets are now right to believe that we will get a Fed rate cut next month?\n\n00:27 Russ Mould\n\nYeah, I think Mr. Williams is clearly being very pragmatic. We are starting to catch up on the information that we've been missing for the last couple of months owing to the US government shutdown and although opinions remain split,\n\n00:36 Russ Mould\n\nit is does seem as if there is some slow down in the US jobs market. There is some cooling there. You can see that in vacancies, weekly claims, and you can see that also in the non-farm payrolls data. We'll get a lot more of that on Friday, but there's probably just enough justification in there for the Fed to at least consider cutting and it's not just cutting this month, but if you look at the see me Fed watch service that you quoted, that's pricing in at the moment or factoring in some like 3% rates by next Christmas. So that's a full percentage point below where we are now.\n\n01:03 Speaker A\n\nNow, one of the thick key themes last week and has been for a while now is worries about an AI bubble. Um, we saw a bounce back on Friday, but do you think those fears of a AI bubble are they're still around, aren't they?\n\n01:14 Russ Mould\n\nvery, very much so. and there are more questions being raised about funding for this phenomenal amount of capital expenditure planned by the hyper scale company, companies, 420 billion this year, 500 billion, then 600 billion dollars in 2027. Will there be a return on that investment given that I'm sure Chinese competition isn't going to sleep on that even if there is substantial adoption. and then where do we sit with valuations? Again when Nvidia's market capitalization reached $5 trillion, same as the GDP of Germany. You know, that's for that does say an awful lot of value that's being provided by the 36,000 Nvidia employees compared to 84 million Germans and Nvidia's results were impressive, but there were some holes that you could pick in them in terms of the cash flow, inventories and receivables, and that came back to the funding issue. So that's probably going to be the biggest area of focus in the next one or two Nvidia quarterly numbers.\n\n01:54 Speaker A\n\nNow, uh, so we've talked about the Fed, we've talked about the bubble. The next thing I really want to talk about is Black Friday because we heard from a lot of retailers last week, kind of a mixed bag. Walmart was clearly the standout there, but what are your hopes for Black Friday?\n\n02:05 Russ Mould\n\nYeah, I mean Home Depot popped out a stinker at the same time. so it's again, we're still seeing a very, very bifurcated consumer. even if you look at the the official statistics, University of Michigan surveys down at levels below that we've seen in the last five or six US recessions.\n\n02:16 Russ Mould\n\nThe conference board survey isn't that bleak, but it's well off the peak of last November when the president was elected and way below the peak seen during his first term in office. So there are signs that some American consumers are feeling the strain. You're seeing that in some of the subprime areas particularly. But again, it's a very K-shaped economy you could argue. those at the top are doing really well, they've got assets. Those further down the pipe are feeling a lot of pressure from inflation.\n\n02:37 Russ Mould\n\nAnd we saw that politically in the November election results as well. So, I think you will see a very, very mixed set of results from retailers. But at least one thing you might argue is that Black Friday is normally pretty good for a discount. So then it's up to the retailers to manage that appropriately and preserve margins as well as generate cash flow.\n\n02:49 Speaker A\n\nI'm not going to get into your shopping list now, but let's look at earnings as well. We've got John Deere, their results out on Wednesday. Um, it's fair to say sentiment amongst farmers isn't that great right now. Am I right?\n\n03:03 Russ Mould\n\nNo, it is and I think the the presidency has been responding to that with some of the trade deals we've seen with with with other countries. Um, but equally, you know, Deer's numbers have been reflecting that. The last set of numbers back in August weren't very strong. Analysts are predicting a double digit percentage earnings per share decline for this quarter and for the year as a whole. I think there will be much more what's the company seeing going forward in terms of backlog and also in terms of tariff impact, they'll be shaping the numbers for the coming year when analysts do expect a 7-8% improvement in earnings per share across the year as a whole.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/crucial-black-friday-ai-bubble-130316114.html", "symbols": ["1NVDA.MI", "AJB.LSE", "HD.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F", "WALM34.SA", "WMT.BA", "WMT.F", "WMT.MX", "WMT.US"], "tags": ["AI-BUBBLE", "EARNINGS", "EARNINGS PER SHARE", "EARNINGS RESULTS", "FED", "INFLATION", "RETAIL", "SPLIT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.045, "neu": 0.86, "pos": 0.095}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T12:55:00+00:00", "title": "Trump has bought $100M in bonds since entering White House, report says. Get on \u2018winning\u2019 side of his big bet", "content": "Getty Images\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has quietly purchased at least $103 million in corporate and municipal bonds since taking office, according to NBC News. [1]\n\nThe filings from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) provide a rare glimpse into the President\u2019s growing investment portfolio.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has cut interest rates once since January, by 0.25% in October (2). The next Federal Reserve meeting is scheduled for December, and will be the last of the year. Trump\u2019s bond-heavy portfolio signals a bet on interest rates dropping. After all, he\u2019s pressuring the Federal Reserve to make that happen. [3] If rates fall, bond prices should rise \u2014 meaning Trump\u2019s holdings could appreciate significantly.\n\nMust Read\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Here\u2019s how it could also work for you\n\nAccording to Forbes, Trump\u2019s estimated net worth is $6.1 billion. His wealth increased by more than $3.2 billion in the past year, and his aggressive bond purchases could further accelerate this trend. [4]\n\nBut beyond bonds, the impact of falling interest rates could also trickle down to everyday Americans in other ways.\n\nAn unprecedented bond binge\n\nU.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) documents show that Trump began his buying spree one day after his inauguration on January 20. He made roughly 690 transactions through Aug. 1.\n\nHis purchases span a wide range of debt instruments \u2014 from bonds issued by the New York Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, to those linked with hospital facilities, airports, school districts, and regional development funds nationwide.\n\nAs Reuters reports, Trump also invested heavily in corporate bonds from megabanks like Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. He also holds significant investments in Qualcomm, T-Mobile USA, Home Depot, UnitedHealth Group, and Meta. [5]\n\nNotably, the filings show no sales of bonds, suggesting Trump is positioning for potential price gains if market conditions shift.\n\nThis level of trading by the President raises questions about possible conflicts of interest. The administration could influence policies affecting corporations and municipalities whose debt Trump owns.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHow Trump\u2019s bet could impact Americans\n\nIf Trump wins his bet and interest rates decline, it will affect everyday Americans. Whether you will benefit from the shift depends on whether you plan to borrow or save money.\n\nBorrowers win:\n\nHomebuyers: If you're an aspiring homeowner, a mortgage rate drop from 7% to 6.5% on a $450,000, 30-year loan could reduce monthly payments by $150. [6]\n\nCredit card holders: Variable-rate APRs tend to decline when the Federal Reserve cuts rates.\n\nConsumers with debt: Auto loans, personal loans, and lines of credit become more affordable for borrowers post-rate cuts. [7]\n\nIf you already have debt, you could still take advantage of falling rates by refinancing your debt. With Credible, you can browse rates with just a few clicks of your mouse.

It won't hurt your credit score, it\u2019s totally free, and it could save you a bundle.\n\nSavers take a hit:\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts: Current yields of around 4.5% could fall to 2\u20133%, cutting interest income nearly in half.\n\nRetirees: Fixed-income products like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) would offer smaller payouts, squeezing returns for those relying on stable income streams. [8]\n\nFuture homebuyers: If your down payment is currently in a high-yield savings account or short-term GIC, your money would grow more slowly, stretching out your timelines for reaching financial goals.\n\nTrending: Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year \u2014 and he begs investors not to miss its \u2018explosion\u2019\n\nHow Americans can prepare\n\nHouseholds should plan for both the upsides and downsides of lower rates:\n\nRefinance debt: If rates fall, consumers should consider locking in lower mortgage, auto, or personal loan rates before they rise again.\n\nInvest strategically: A good tip is to consider equities or diversified bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to benefit from the value of rising assets after rate cuts.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a collaborative approach to researching and analyzing investment strategies and opportunities, Public offers a community-driven platform for investment insights.\n\nPublic\u2019s social investing features let you share ideas with a community of investors and gain insights from your peers.\n\nThe platform democratizes investing by offering a commission-free platform for trading stocks, REITs, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, treasuries, and even alternative assets.\n\nRight now, you can take advantage of a 1% uncapped match on every transfer, including brokerage and IRA transfers, 401(k) rollovers, and IRA contributions.\n\nDiversify your savings: Don\u2019t rely solely on high-yield interest accounts.

Is It Time to Give Up on the Dividend-Paying Dow Stock?", "content": "Key Points\n\nHome Depot has historically been a company that investors could count on for consistent results.  A sluggish housing market and lower consumer spending are weighing on the company. Home Depot stock is a good value and pays a growing dividend. 10 stocks we like better than Home Depot \u203a\n\nHome Depot(NYSE: HD) is among a rare breed of companies that is so massive and influential that it's worth following even if you aren't interested in the stock. Home Depot's results act as a barometer on the state of the housing market, the construction industry, the U.S. consumer, and more.\n\nWhen Home Depot is doing well, it typically means consumers are spending on costly home improvement and home renovation projects. Slowing results can signal that consumers are tightening their purse strings amid economic pressures.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nUnfortunately, Home Depot has been in slowdown mode for years.\n\nHere's what investors need to know from the company's latest quarterly results and whether the dividend-payingDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) component is worth buying now.\n\nImage source: Home Depot.\n\nThe slowdown continues\n\nHome Depot stock is hovering around a 52-week low after the company reported disappointing third-quarter fiscal 2025 results and updated its full-year guidance.\n\nHome Depot now expects a slight increase in comparable 52-week sales growth but a 5% decline in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). For context, when Home Depot reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results in February, it guided for a 1% increase in comparable-sales growth and a 2% reduction in diluted EPS from $15.24 in 2023.\n\nHome Depot's fiscal 2023 diluted EPS was $15.25, which was a 9.5% decline from $16.69 in fiscal 2022 diluted EPS. This means that Home Depot's growth isn't just slowing. Earnings have been falling for more than three years.\n\nOn Home Depot's Nov. 18earnings call CEO Ted Decker said that Home Depot expected to see a pickup in demand in the second half of the year because management was expecting interest rates and mortgage rates to come down. Instead, Home Depot saw ongoing consumer uncertainty and a weak housing market that is disproportionately impacting home improvement demand.\n\nHome Depot's weak results highlight the bifurcation in today's economy between the struggling consumer-facing sector and the rip-roaring stock market, which has been on a tear for the last three years, largely thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) growth stocks and financial stocks.\n\nDecker addressed this divide on theearnings call\n\nSo it's certainly a very interesting consumer dynamic out there. On the one hand, you look at certain economic indicators and you say, geez, things are pretty good. You look at GDP [Gross Domestic Product], you look at PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditures], those are both strong. But on the other hand, what's impacting us in home improvement is the ongoing pressure in housing and incremental consumer uncertainty.\n\nIn recent earnings calls, management's tone has noticeably shifted from cautiously optimistic to more serious as the severity of the slowdown in housing and consumer spending intensifies. This is why it's unsurprising to see Home Depot trim its full-year fiscal guidance.\n\nHome Depot is a reasonable value with a sizable dividend yield\n\nAfter falling 6% on Nov. 18 and another 0.6% on Nov. 19, Home Depot is now down 14% year to date and is up just 24% over the last five years, compared to an 86.2% gain in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and a 56.7% gain in the Dow.\n\nThe sell-off is arguably justified, given three consecutive years of lower adjusted earnings. Despite the poor results, there are still reasons to be optimistic about owning Home Depot over the long term.\n\nHome Depot is far from alone in this slowdown. It's an industrywide decline. In fact, management reiterated on the recent earnings call that it still believes Home Depot is taking market share -- meaning many of its peers are faring even worse.\n\nHome Depot's valuation was overextended after the company experienced a temporary boom in demand during the pandemic's heights. Since then, however, the valuation has gone from expensive to now much more reasonable at 23.2 times its updated fiscal 2025 adjusted diluted EPS guidance.\n\nDespite negative earnings growth, Home Depot continues to raise its dividend. It has increased its annual payout for 16 consecutive years. However, its latest increase was a 2.2% dividend raise -- the smallest percentage increase since it began boosting its payout in 2010. The ongoing raises, paired with Home Depot's declining stock price, have pushed its yield up to 2.7%. For context, Home Depot's dividend yield hasn't been above 3% in the last five years, and it has gotten as low as 1.6%.\n\nHome Depot is a worth a closer look for patient investors\n\nHome Depot is a fantastic company that is operating in the midst of arguably the worst industry slowdown since the 2008 financial crisis. At times like these, it's essential for long-term investors not to let present-day narratives cloud their judgment.\n\nHome Depot remains the dominant home improvement company in the U.S., with a sizable presence in Canada and Mexico.\n\nAfter years of being somewhat expensive, the stock is now a much better value and sports a sizable dividend yield.\n\nOverall, Home Depot stands out as a great buy for long-term investors with at least a three-to-five-year ownership plan, especially those looking for a blue chip dividend stock to boost their passive income stream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Home Depot right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Home Depot, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Home Depot wasn\u2019t one of them.

Power 2023 U.S. Appliance Satisfaction Study, reported Business Wire. \"Though 29% of purchases take place online, most shoppers still want to see the appliance in person.\"\n\nBut a strong website is still key.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s data shows us that 56% of home appliance shoppers are doing their research online before heading in store to purchase,\u201d said J.D. Power's Christina Cooley.\n\nWhy you should shop at independent appliance chains\n\nOn its website, Voss TV and appliances, a local retailer itself, offered reasons why customers should avoid big chains.\n\nLong-term appliance specialists: Local appliance stores often have a team of specialists who have been in the business for many years.\r\n These specialists understand appliances inside and out. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations based on years of experience. Many local stores focus on building long-term relationships with their customers. This trust can lead to better service and support over time. Huge selection of appliances: Local appliance stores often carry a wide range of brands and models that may not be available at big chains. While big chains may stock popular brands, local stores might offer unique or specialty brands that focus on quality and performance.\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Nov 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Retail section.

Home Depot Inc. dropped more than 5% in the five days, the most since March, after lowering its outlook as strapped homeowners hold off on big-ticket purchases.\n\nEven Walmart Inc., the belle of the retailer ball with huge profits and a rosy forecast, sent an economic warning of sorts. Its shares rallied in the week, but the growth it reported came largely from groceries and mid-tier customers looking for bargains \u2014 both signs of skittishness among consumers.\n\nThis week\u2019s results, which also included reports from Gap Inc., Ross Stores Inc. and TJX Cos., showed that a growing number of consumers are questioning discretionary purchases while trading down for essentials to stretch every dollar. More worryingly, wealthier Americans who have powered the economy for most of the year are becoming cost-conscious. The mood was captured by University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment gauge, which fell to near the lowest on record this month.\n\n\u201cConsumers remain frustrated about the persistence of high prices and weakening incomes,\u201d the report said.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for an economy driven by consumer spending, especially as persistent inflation may keep the Federal Reserve from cutting rates even as the labor market shows signs of weakness.\n\n\u201cAffordability is a major issue during the pivotal holiday stretch that matters most for earnings growth,\u201d said Timothy Chubb, chief investment officer at Girard, a Univest Wealth Division. \u201cI worry that Corporate America\u2019s revenue growth will slow from here and margins will get squeezed as consumer sentiment sours and the economy and labor market soften even further as companies pass on price increases to cash-strapped shoppers.\u201d\n\nRetailer stocks have been trailing the broader market for several years, especially as AI euphoria sent investor dollars pouring into tech and related bets. But the dynamic is worsening in 2025 as lower-end consumers get squeezed by inflation and the job market.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe S&P Retail Select Industry Index \u2014 which includes Macy\u2019s Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Dollar Tree Inc. \u2014 is flat for the year. Target is down 35%, Bath & Body Works Inc. is off 62% and Carmax Inc. has lost 57%. Cut-rate retailers like Dollar Tree Inc. and Dollar General Corp., along with online marketplaces like EBay Inc. and ThredUp Inc. have surged.\n\nInvestors will get more crucial Christmas shopping season forecasts this week as Best Buy Co., Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc. and apparel retailers Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and Urban Outfitters Inc. report results.\n\nStrong profit outlooks would give US stocks a much-needed tailwind into year-end, with the S&P 500 already down 3.5% this month \u2014 heading for its worst November since 2008.\n\nIf Walmart lives up to its bellwether status, investors could be in for a rough ride. While its business is humming - the stock rose 2.8% last week \u2014 the boost came from spending by upper-income households that usually shop at higher end stores.\n\n\u201cWe continue to benefit from higher-income families choosing to shop with us more often,\u201d Doug McMillon, the retailer\u2019s chief executive officer, said. \u201cMiddle-income households have been steady. Lower-income families have been under additional pressure of late.\u201d\n\nA similar dynamic boosted off-price retailers TJX and Ross Stores, which reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and boosted their outlook on the expectation that consumers seeking out value will drive growth this holiday season.\n\nThe last batch of retailer earnings, culminating Dec. 3 with Macy\u2019s Inc., may flash a green light for investors. But sticky inflation is forcing shoppers to pay more for essentials, and that\u2019s left stores stuck with a glut of products, causing retailers to mark down prices at the expense of profits.\n\nAlthough inflation has been cooling, Bloomberg Intelligence says price pressures will remain a key hurdle for the discretionary and staples sectors. That\u2019s why retail executives\u2019 tone on promotions and holiday shopping will be crucial.\n\nA cautious approach is understandable. The bad news reflects how inflation, and growing economic uncertainty are weighing on holiday spending plans. And sales from the fourth quarter, traditionally the strongest time of the year, may not be a savior this time around as more stores and chains warn of frugal shoppers.\n\nThere\u2019s some reason for hope, though. Holiday spending will surpass $1 trillion this year and set a record despite consumer caution, according to a forecast by the National Retail Federation.\n\nThat said, this year\u2019s shopping season is shaping up to be more subdued than last year, with fewer consumers planning to increase holiday spending mostly driven by higher prices, according to data compiled by Michelle Weaver, US thematic and equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIn fact, 38% of consumers plan to keep their holiday budgets the same, 30% expect to spend more while 23% expect to spend less \u2014 resulting in a net increase of 6% spending growth from a year earlier, down significantly from 14% growth in the 2024 period.\n\nWith the holiday sales season here, history says the Thanksgiving week means increased volatility for consumer stocks.\n\n\u201cThe Grinch is not going to steal Christmas for retailers and shoppers, but holiday promotions and discounts will be crucial to spur holiday spending to support earnings growth and stock prices into year-end,\u201d said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPermabull Tom Lee Sees Bitcoin as High as $200,000 by January\u2019s End Weed Drinks That Get You Very, Very High Could Be Gone Soon The Dirty Secret of Biodegradable Plastic Cutting Ties With China Is Harder Than Companies Expected The New Requirement for MBAs Seeking Consulting Jobs: AI Proficiency\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-stocks-unlikely-holiday-miracle-140000985.html", "symbols": ["ANF.US", "BBY.US", "COST.US", "DKS.US", "DLTR.US", "DYH.BE", "DYH.DU", "DYH.F", "DYH.HM", "DYH.MU", "EBAY.US", "GPS.US", "HD.MX", "HD.US", "HDI.BE", "HDI.DU", "HDI.F", "HDI.HM", "HDI.MU", "HDI0.F", "HOME34.SA"], "tags": ["CONSUMER-SENTIMENT", "EARNINGS", "EARNINGS GROWTH", "FOURTH QUARTER", "HOLIDAY-SPENDING", "INFLATION", "RETAIL", "REVENUE GROWTH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.063, "neu": 0.795, "pos": 0.142}}, {"date": "2025-11-22T00:41:00+00:00", "title": "IBM Is an AI and IT Leader Set for Growth, Says Analyst.

Following his remarks, the probability of a December rate cut, as measured by the CME FedWatch Tool, surged from 39% to 71%. Lower interest rates can stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper for both consumers and businesses, which often translates to increased consumer spending. This prospect is outweighing recent reports of lower consumer confidence, as investors bet that a more accommodative Fed policy will support retailers through the holiday season.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nHome Furniture Retailer company Sleep Number (NASDAQ:SNBR) jumped 3.3%.

In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 3.6% on the news that the company announced significant board changes as part of a cooperation agreement with activist investor Elliott Investment Management, one of its largest investors.\n\nAs part of an ongoing refreshment program, the automotive and industrial parts provider appointed two new independent directors: Court Carruthers, former CEO of TricorBraun, and Matt Carey, a former executive at Home Depot, eBay, and Walmart. The appointments coincide with the retirement of two long-serving board members. These changes are part of a formal Cooperation Agreement with Elliott, which also includes an information-sharing arrangement to facilitate ongoing dialogue. Such moves, particularly when involving a prominent activist investor, are often viewed positively by the market as they can signal a stronger focus on enhancing shareholder value and strategic improvements.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGenuine Parts is up 7.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $125.00 per share, it is still trading 12.4% below its 52-week high of $142.77 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Genuine Parts\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,287.\n\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can\u2019t build without.

As of Nov. 21, 95% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts are expecting a 13.4% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter.

While 83% of companies have reported a positive earnings surprise, it's the revenue growth in Q3 that stands out.\n\nButters notes that S&P 500 companies are reporting the highest revenue growth rate in three years.\n\nIf it holds, the S&P 500's current blended revenue growth rate of 8.4% in Q3 would be the highest mark since Q3 2022, when the index posted a revenue growth rate of 11%.\n\nThe Health Care, Financials, and Consumer Discretionary sectors have led the revenue growth trend, with companies such as Cardinal Health (CAH), Morgan Stanley (MS), Ford (F), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA), among many others, contributing significantly.S&P 500 revenue growth is tracking for the highest level in three years.

Wall Street was expecting $3.9 billion in revenue and $0.59 per share in earnings, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nGap's three core brands \u2014 the namesake Gap brand, Old Navy, and Banana Republic \u2014 showed strength during the quarter, while athleisure brand Athleta was the clear laggard. Same-store sales at Gap rose 7% year over year, sales at Old Navy rose 6%, and sales at Banana Republic rose 4%. Athleta's same-store sales, meanwhile, dropped 11%, as Gap said it's applying a \"reinvigoration playbook\" to the brand.\n\nGap also raised the lower end of its full-year revenue forecast.

Earnings per share of $0.37 also declined year over year and fell short of expectations for $0.39 per share.\n\nThe seller of soaps and body lotions also said it doesn't expect much improvement this year, due to negative consumer sentiment. The company said it expects Q4 sales to be down in the high single digits versus last year. It also lowered its full-year net sales profit to a decline of low single digits from growth of 1.5% to 2.7% previously.\n\nFull-year earnings per share are now expected to be at least $2.83. The Street was looking for guidance of $3.33.\n\nOn the company's earnings call, Bath & Body Works CEO Daniel Heaf, who joined the company in May, said Bath & Body Works failed to adapt to changing consumer preferences and outlined a plan to turn the company around over the next couple of years, emphasizing that the strategic reset will take \"time and focus.\"\n\n\"Over the years, consumers have evolved,\" Heaf said on the earnings call. \"They seek greater efficacy, ingredient-led products, modern packaging, ... storytelling, and elevated multichannel experiences.

(NYSE:HD) his \u201cgo-to stock.\u201d In this show, Cramer maintained that The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) was a top stock with respect to interest rate cuts:Jim Cramer Gets Into Spirited Debate About Home Depot (HD) With Co-Hosts\n\n\u201c[On earnings] Right now, this is, I\u2019ve just issued a Buy to club members. I\u2019ve been holding off since March, fearing this. Not necessarily the bottom, it certainly leaves some room. But this is the premier company to buy when you get rate cuts. We had some interesting. . .I just got to tell you, this economy, I know that the hiring seems a little weaker, and some people say prices are still too high, the President\u2019s actually doing something about it. . .beef, bananas, coffee. . .I have to buy it because this is what the playbook says to do. When everyone throws it up, it\u2019s the premier company involving this, you have to take the other side. Look, do I want to? What\u2019s more painful? What\u2019s more painful than buying this? \u201c[After David Faber commented that there hasn\u2019t been revenue growth for years since COVID since people were doing their at home projects] We\u2019re at a 40 year low in housing. They\u2019re supposed to do well?\u201d \u201c[Carl Quintanilla discussed ICE raids and Home Depot\u2019s silence] I guess what I\u2019m saying is, we do not know when ICE is going to stop targeting them. We do not know when housing\u2019s going to turn around. But we do know, and I know David, you\u2019re right that it\u2019s not been a great buy for a long time. \u201c[Faber reiterated that revenue growth has not been significant for years potentially due to COVID uptick and the stock trades at a high multiple] They don\u2019t put up a lot of stores, they are the best, no one except for maybe Marvin Ellison of Lowe\u2019s, would disagree that they are the best. . . \u201c[When Faber wondered what does it say about consumer when Home Depot talks about uncertainty and pressure in housing] You have tariffs on a lot of companies, they have white goods that have been hurt because of the tariffs. . .but look, if I think the tariffs may be removed, and I think that the Fed will cut, I don\u2019t want to necessarily go buy Toll Brothers, as much as I like Toll Brothers, I\u2019d buy Home Depot. So I\u2019m taking the other side of this trade, knowing that it looks horrible. Because sometimes the bottom is when it looks horrible, not when it\u2019s at the top.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t make one big statement buy I haven\u2019t done that since 1981 when I had my head handed to me on a Delta buy. [David asked if he was buying a little] Yeah, exactly. And then I\u2019ll buy more. That\u2019s how I do it!. . .I\u2019m taking down 25 shares of Home Depot, right, 25 shares. . . \u201cYeah look I think that you want to buy this. This is historically a stock that you want to buy when things are terrible in housing. It\u2019s got a 2.6% yield. I think it could go all the way down to a 3%. You want a leg into it, and again, we didn\u2019t buy any since March, I just think it\u2019s a fantastic company and Ted Decker\u2019s great. If you buy this when housing\u2019s great, you\u2019re going to lose money. If you buy this when housing\u2019s really horrible, you\u2019re going to make money but you\u2019re gonna have some pain first.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

They told us the consumer wasn\u2019t collapsing, but they also weren\u2019t opening their wallets like they used to. Big home projects were getting delayed. DIY was soft. And inventory levels were steady enough that a big January restock wasn\u2019t coming.\n\nNow Lowe\u2019s and Walmart have stepped up to the mic \u2014 and they\u2019ve basically confirmed everything Home Depot hinted at. And for small carriers who live and die by freight cycles instead of corporate projections, this second round of earnings offers something even more important: clarity.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through what these two retail giants really told us.\n\nLowe\u2019s \u2014 The Project Economy Is Moving, But Slowly\n\nLowe\u2019s numbers differed from Home Depot in a way that\u2019s almost impossible to ignore. Sales were steady, but not strong. Customers are still buying the basics, but they\u2019re holding off on big remodels, upgrades, or unnecessary home improvement plans.\n\nWhat stood out most was Lowe\u2019s comment about their Pro customer base \u2014 the contractors and builders who typically drive the bulk of construction-related freight. They\u2019re still coming in, still spending, still working. But they\u2019re not scaling. They\u2019re not taking on bigger jobs. They\u2019re not pulling the trigger on the kind of materials orders that push big volumes through flatbed, LTL, and regional van networks.\n\nThat\u2019s a meaningful signal.\n\nThe construction world is usually a leading indicator for freight three to four months down the road. When contractors are confident, they buy early and stock up. When they\u2019re unsure, they buy only what the job requires \u2014 nothing more. And right now, Lowe\u2019s is telling us they\u2019re in the second camp.\n\nFor truckers, that likely means a slower January and February for materials, appliances, fixtures, and other home-related freight. There will still be freight \u2014 it just won\u2019t be the heavy-volume kind that kicks off an early spring surge. Flatbeds rely heavily on the building material segment that both Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot rely on. Pro penetration (the total percentage of retail sales from the pro customer) is the bread and butter of these two retail giants.Balanced inventory levels across retailers suggest limited early-year restocking, which typically keeps truckload demand flat heading into Q1. (Source: SONAR. TRIS.USA)\n\nWalmart \u2014 The Consumer Is Stable, But Far More Disciplined\n\nIf Home Depot shows one slice of American spending and Lowe\u2019s shows another, Walmart reveals the whole heartbeat. And Walmart\u2019s Q3 earnings tell a complicated but honest story: the consumer is still spending, but spending with caution.\n\nGrocery was strong. Everyday essentials were strong. E-commerce showed healthy growth. But the discretionary categories \u2014 the TVs, electronics, decor, general merchandise \u2014 are soft. Not dead. Just soft enough that Walmart isn\u2019t ordering aggressively.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnd when Walmart isn\u2019t ordering aggressively, DCs across the country shift into \u201cdefensive mode.\u201d They keep stock tight. They replenish only when they need to, especially in the final stretch. They avoid big forward-positioning pushes.\n\nThat discipline potentially affects the entire trucking ecosystem:\n\nfewer replenishment runs leaving import DCs  fewer high-margin consumer loads  fewer regional surges tied to general merchandise  less long-haul van freight being pushed ahead of Q1\n\nWhat Walmart actually revealed is that the consumer hasn\u2019t stopped \u2014 they\u2019ve just changed how they spend. More groceries. More necessities. More value-based shopping. Less impulse buying. Less big-ticket activity.\n\nAnd that creates a freight environment that moves, but doesn\u2019t accelerate.\n\nWhat This Really Means for Q1\n\nPut all three together \u2014 Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, and Walmart \u2014 and a clear picture emerges of what small carriers can expect heading into the first quarter of 2026.\n\nJanuary is almost setup to be slow. This isn\u2019t a year where large retailers overshot their inventory and now need to refill everything at once. If anything, they\u2019ve kept inventory lean on purpose. That means less panic-buying, less urgent replenishment, and fewer \u201cpushes\u201d of freight into distribution centers early in the year. We have seen this in the slowing of inbound container volume as well.\n\nThe consumer is stable \u2014 not booming, not collapsing \u2014 which creates a freight market that\u2019s steady but tight. Rates don\u2019t crash in an environment like this, but they also don\u2019t climb. The freight isn\u2019t drying up; it\u2019s just not expanding in a way that moves spot rates. When you throw in added capacity, you experience rate stagnation.\n\nWinter will be carried mostly by essentials: food, supplies, household goods, consumables, the kind of freight that never truly goes away. This will keep trucks rolling, but not at aggressive rates.\n\nConstruction-related freight looks slow until at least March. The Pros aren\u2019t scaling, and Lowe\u2019s made that clear. Without those early-material orders, the spring build-up could hit later than normal.\n\nE-commerce will help keep freight flowing, especially into the Southeast and major metro areas, but it won\u2019t save the quarter. So much of that freight is already locked under contract with mega carriers \u2014 they\u2019ll eat first, as always.\n\nAnd DCs being cautious creates a predictable effect: no spikes, fewer swings, and tighter spot availability.\n\nThe Real Story Small Carriers Should Pay Attention To\n\nThe real story isn\u2019t the earnings numbers. It\u2019s the behavior underlying those numbers. Retailers are acting intentionally conservative right now:\n\nThey\u2019re ordering strategically.  They\u2019re protecting margins.  They\u2019re avoiding overstocking, which they learned from the pandemic.  They\u2019re leaning harder on forecasting models.  They\u2019re only replenishing when the customer forces their hand.\n\nIn trucking, volatility creates opportunity. When inventories run too low, freight surges. When inventories run too high, freight surges again as retailers scramble to reposition. But in a balanced environment \u2014 the kind these retailers are carefully maintaining \u2014 volatility disappears.\n\nAnd without volatility, the spot market stays quiet.\n\nWhat Carriers Should Watch Between Now and February\n\nThe next eight to twelve weeks matter. They\u2019ll decide how spring looks. Carriers should watch:\n\nWhether Walmart increases grocery purchase orders after holiday demand  Whether Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot place early spring orders for materials  Whether import volumes begin climbing into West Coast ports  Whether consumer sentiment in January ticks up or down  Whether DCs start hiring seasonal warehouse crews early\n\nThese things matter more than capacity exits, more than short-term rate bumps, and more than the social media predictions that pop up every week.\n\nRetail tells the truth first. Trucking feels the truth later.\n\nRight now, retail is telling us to expect a slow climb into spring.\n\nFinal Thought \u2014 This Is a Quarter to Be Smart, Not Overly Optimistic\n\nThis winter will reward small carriers who manage their cost per mile, keep their lanes tight, and secure relationships with brokers they trust.

(NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, today announced the successful closing of the previously announced offering of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% convertible notes due 2033, including the full exercise of the initial purchasers\u2019 option to purchase an additional $56.25 million aggregate principal amount of the notes, resulting in a total aggregate principal amount of $431.25 million. Plug received total net proceeds from the offering of approximately $399.4 million, after deducting the initial purchasers\u2019 discount and estimated offering expenses.\n\nThe proceeds allow Plug to retire all remaining high-cost 15% debt, refinance its 2026 convertible notes, and eliminate the first lien previously held by its former debt provider. These actions significantly reduce interest expense, simplify Plug\u2019s capital structure, and enhance financial flexibility.\n\nImportantly, the refinancing also extends Plug\u2019s lower cost of capital through an eight-year tenor balloon note, providing stable, long-duration financing with no required amortization over that period. This structure preserves liquidity and eliminates near-term principal repayment pressure.\n\nTogether with Plug\u2019s recently announced data center infrastructure agreement, the company now has a fully funded business plan based on its current operating expectations.\n\n\u201cThis financing marks a major turning point for Plug,\u201d said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power. \u201cWith $399 million in new cash, the removal of the first lien, and reduced interest costs, Plug now has one of the strongest balance sheets in years. Extending our lower cost of capital over an eight-year tenor further enhances our flexibility. We are well positioned to support sales growth in both material handling and electrolyzers as customer demand accelerates.\u201d\n\nPlug already has the manufacturing capacity required to meet its growth trajectory. The strengthened balance sheet provides the stability and flexibility needed to support commercial momentum across material handling fleets, distribution centers, and utility-scale electrolyzer deployments.\n\nAbout Plug Power\r\nPlug is building the global hydrogen economy with a fully integrated ecosystem spanning production, storage, delivery, and power generation. A first mover in the industry, Plug provides electrolyzers, liquid hydrogen, fuel cell systems, storage tanks, and fueling infrastructure to industries such as material handling, industrial applications, and energy producers\u2014advancing energy independence and decarbonization at scale.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith electrolyzers deployed across five continents, Plug leads in hydrogen production, delivering large-scale projects that redefine industrial power. The company has deployed over 72,000 fuel cell systems and 275 fueling stations and is the largest user of liquid hydrogen. Plug is rapidly expanding its generation network to ensure reliable, domestically produced supply, with hydrogen plants currently operational in Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana, capable of producing 40 tons per day.\n\nWith employees and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities across the globe, Plug powers global leaders like Walmart, Amazon, Home Depot, BMW, and BP.\n\nFor more information, visit www.plugpower.com.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Home Depot (HD).\n\nHome Depot currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.82, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.82 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.5% and 2.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for HDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for HD\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Home Depot here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Home Depot, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs HD a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Home Depot, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 3.3% over the past month to $14.64.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Home Depot. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Home Depot with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Earnings per share of $0.37 also declined year over year and fell short of expectations for $0.39 per share.\n\nThe seller of soaps and body lotions also said it doesn't expect much improvement this year, due to negative consumer sentiment.

The Street was looking for guidance of $3.33.\n\nOn the company's earnings call, Bath & Body Works CEO Daniel Heaf, who joined the company in May, said Bath & Body Works failed to adapt to changing consumer preferences and outlined a plan to turn the company around over the next couple of years, emphasizing that the strategic reset will take \"time and focus.\"\n\n\"Over the years, consumers have evolved,\" Heaf said on the earnings call. \"They seek greater efficacy, ingredient-led products, modern packaging, ... storytelling, and elevated multichannel experiences.

There, Walmart is optimistic too.\n\n\"Holiday is off to a pretty good start,\" Rainey said on the company's earnings call. \"Back-to-school tends to be an early indicator for how that goes, Halloween, likewise for Thanksgiving, and everything that we've seen so far makes us optimistic and encouraged about customers and members leaning into the seasonal events and holiday shopping period.\" Wed, November 19, 2025 at 10:38 PM UTC\n\nBrett LoGiurato\n\nHuang rebuts claims of AI 'bubble'\n\nNvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang took direct aim at analysts and commentators touting the risk of an AI \"bubble,\" touting how his company is poised for success in the rapidly evolving frontier.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" Huang said on the company's earnings call, after Nvidia's results and forecast beat estimates.\n\nHuang said Nvidia is positioned for success in \"every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\" Wed, November 19, 2025 at 10:23 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia CFO reiterates $500 billion Blackwell, Ruben revenue pipeline\n\nNvidia's earnings call is underway, and CFO Colette Kress said Blackwell sales continue to gain momentum while Ruben remains \"on track\" to ramp in the second half of 2026.\n\n\"We currently have visibility to a half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026,\" Kress said.\n\nShe later added, \"The GB300 crossed over GB200 and contributed roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue.

It was a nice, solid beat and raise,\" Bernstein senior analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance just after the release.\n\nFurther details on Nvidia's visibility into future revenue will be in focus when the earnings call kicks off at 5 p.m. ET.\n\n\"The company is essentially completely being driven by data centers,\" CFRA analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton. \"The fact that we remain supply constrained here, which we think will persist through 2026, and just based on the bookings that we saw here from the hyperscalers ... means that it's going to be a fairly supply constrained through of next year, and probably well through 2027 if not all of '27.\"\n\n\"That's going to bode well for the data center revenue potential,\" Zino said. \"We think margins will be able to be sustained at that mid-70s level here for the foreseeable future.\" Wed, November 19, 2025 at 9:24 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nPalo Alto Networks beats on earnings, announces intent to acquire Chronosphere\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) stock declined by 5% in extended trading despite an earnings beat for its fiscal first quarter.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm reported earnings per share of $0.93 on revenue of $2.47 billion, a 16% revenue increase year over year.

Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $1.22 per share on revenue of $14.85 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nSame-store sales increased 5% year over year, broadly growing across divisions. The company increased its inventory by $1 billion to $9.4 billion.\n\nTJX also lifted its sales, profit margin, and earnings per share guidance for the full year.\n\nComparable sales are expected to be up 4%, while pretax profit margin is expected to be at 11.6%. TJX expects diluted earnings per share in a range of $4.63 to $4.66, which is above the raised guidance of $4.52 to $4.57 it provided in the second quarter.\n\n\"The fourth quarter is off to a strong start, the availability of merchandise continues to be outstanding, and we are excited about the deals we are seeing in the marketplace,\" TJX Companies CEO Ernie Herrman stated.

Tue, November 18, 2025 at 9:46 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nHow important is Nvidia's earnings report to the market?\n\nNvidia's (NVDA) earnings report after the close on Wednesday will serve as a moment of truth for a market fixated on concerns about AI overbuilding, valuations, and growth.\n\nThe stock may be poised for a dramatic move after the results are posted.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Reuters reported that Nvidia options implied a 7% move in either direction in the wake of its quarterly report. That could trigger a $320 billion swing in the chipmaker's market value, which would mark its largest move in post-earnings. At last check, Nvidia's market cap stood around $4.42 trillion.\n\nWith so many AI stocks tied to Nvidia's fortunes, a significant swing in either direction could have wide-reaching impacts in markets.\n\n\"It's a macro indicator at this point,\" Empower chief investment strategist Marta Norton said to Yahoo Finance about Nvidia earnings. With expectations running high, Norton was skeptical about Nvidia's ability to pull out an upside surprise.\n\n\"The concern is, even if they do blow it out, that investors are still going to be skittish, just because that's the sentiment in the markets today,\" Norton said. \"So I think it is very critical. I'm not sure, though, even if it's a strong report, that it's necessarily going to tip the scales in favor of a market rally.\" Tue, November 18, 2025 at 9:43 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock jumps on earnings, revenue beat\n\nLa-Z-Boy jumped over 5% after the close on Tuesday after the furniture maker reported earnings and revenue that were roughly in line with results a year ago but beat analysts' expectations amid a turnaround push.\n\nHere's what La-Z-Boy reported for its fiscal second quarter, compared to Wall Street consensus estimates compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nRetail sales in La-Z-Boy-owned stores increased 4% compared to the same period a year ago, and wholesale sales increased 2%. Joybird brand sales rose 1%.\n\nLa-Z-Boy opened 15 new stores during the quarter and moved to transform its portfolio. The company announced plans to exit its upholstery businesses that are not its core North American upholstery business, proposed the closure of its UK manufacturing plant, and underwent a corporate restructuring as well.\n\nFor the current quarter, the company expects sales to be in a range of $525 million-$545 million, reflecting revenue growth of 1%-4% year over year.

The company also lowered its fourth-quarter and full-year guidance, \u201creflecting current business trends and continuation of recent macro consumer pressures.\u201d Earlier this week, Home Depot fell short of Wall Street\u2019s earnings expectations for the third quarter in a row and Target reported a drop in quarterly sales.

We saw home improvement retailer Home Depot post a mediocre quarterly performance that fell short of analyst expectations on profitability amid softer-than-anticipated demand. But rival Lowe\u2019s maintained its focus on operational efficiencies and Pro segments which provided an edge, leading to a more resilient bottom line despite similar macro pressures like deferred big-ticket projects.\n\nWe then heard from Walmart competitor Target, who saw recent troubles linger in the latest quarter as the company missed on revenues and posted weak comparable sales. The number of transactions declined year-over-year as well for Target, reinforcing a theme of overall cautious spending and leading the retailer to cut its full-year profit guidance ahead of a potentially tepid holiday season.\n\nAll signs pointed to the weak retail sentiment spilling over into Walmart\u2019s results, but the king of retail had other plans.\n\nWalmart\u2019s Third-Quarter Masterclass in Outperforming Peers\n\nWalmart delivered a robust fiscal third-quarter performance this morning, surpassing analyst expectations on both revenue and earnings amid resilient consumer demand for value and essentials. The company reported total revenue of $179.5 billion, up 5.8% year-over-year (+6.0% in constant currency), exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $177.14 billion by 1.3%.\n\nThe big-box retailer resumed its long history of earnings beats after a rare miss in the prior quarter. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.62, edging by our projection of $0.61 by 1.6%. Walmart\u2019s bottom line grew 6.9% year-over-year; the positive surprise was driven by market share gains across income cohorts and operational efficiencies.\n\nComparable sales showed solid growth, with Walmart U.S. comps rising 4.5% (ex-fuel), supported by a 1.8% increase in transactions and a 2.7% uptick in average ticket. This follows a 4.6% increase in the prior quarter, where e-commerce played a significant role in boosting overall performance.\n\nAnd once again, e-commerce was a standout with global sales surging 27%, fueled by store-fulfilled pickup, delivery, and marketplace expansions. Membership trends continued upward, with global membership income rising 16.7%. Advertising also shone, with global growth at 53% (including VIZIO) and Walmart Connect in the U.S. up 33% from the year-ago period.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer spending patterns revealed a focus on value, with strength in groceries, health and wellness, and private brands, alongside modest gains in general merchandise like apparel and toys. Foot traffic improved, with global weekly visits exceeding 270 million, and higher-income households driving incremental gains.\n\nPositive Q3 Results Lead to Enhanced Outlook\n\nWalmart updated its fiscal 2026 outlook upward, with the company now expecting net sales growth of 4.8%-5.1% (previously 3.75%-4.75%), and adjusted EPS of $2.58-$2.63 (up from $2.52-$2.62). However, the Bentonville-based retailer said it now expects capital expenditures for the year to be approximately 3.5% of net sales, on the high end of its previous range.\n\nThese results position Walmart favorably going forward, with its digital and membership momentum providing a competitive edge in a price-sensitive environment, potentially sustaining market share gains through the holiday quarter under incoming CEO John Furner's value-focused strategy. Walmart is aggressively emphasizing deeper discounts and broader \"bigger savings\" across toys, electronics, home goods, and gifts\u2014particularly on items under $20\u2014to appeal to budget-strapped consumers.\n\nThe approach prioritizes unmatched value combined with enhanced convenience, including accelerated same-day pickup, faster delivery, and a longer promotional calendar that spreads deals beyond Black Friday.\n\nIn contrast to Target's recent Q3 report, which featured weak comparative sales as well as a net sales decline that also missed estimates, Walmart's comprehensive beats highlight its broader appeal across essentials and e-commerce, underscoring resilience amid economic pressures.\n\nFor the broader retail industry, Walmart's performance signals a bifurcated consumer landscape, where value-oriented giants thrive by attracting diverse income groups while discretionary-focused peers like Target face headwinds, suggesting a continued emphasis on affordability and omnichannel strategies to navigate uncertainty.\n\nWMT shares were trading up more than 6% in early trading following the release.\n\nWalmart\u2019s Tech-Driven Evolution Results in Nasdaq Listing\n\nWalmart\u2019s announcement to transfer its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Global Select Market, while retaining the ticker symbol \u201cWMT,\u201d appears driven by several strategic considerations. The primary stated reason is to better align with Walmart\u2019s evolving emphasis on technology and innovation in retail. Specifically, the move underscores shared values between Walmart and Nasdaq, including a \u201ctechnology-forward approach,\u201d delivering exceptional client value, and redefining industries through innovation.\n\nThis comes amid Walmart\u2019s broader AI push, including investments in supply chain optimization, predictive analytics, and personalized shopping tools, positioning the retailer more like a tech-enabled company rather than a traditional brick-and-mortar giant. Another likely factor is the opportunity for Walmart to be added to the Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq. This could enhance liquidity, visibility among tech-savvy investors, and overall stock performance.\n\nWhile not explicitly stated in the announcement, general advantages of listing on Nasdaq over NYSE could play a role, such as potentially lower listing fees, more flexible governance rules, or greater appeal to growth-oriented investors.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s reputation as a hub for innovative companies aligns with Walmart\u2019s transformation, especially as e-commerce now accounts for a significant portion of its growth (up 27% in Q3). The timing, coinciding with strong Q3 results and an upward revision to FY2026 guidance, suggests the move is part of a broader effort to signal confidence in its tech-driven future.\n\nOverall, the outlook remains bright for the world\u2019s largest retailer. The third-quarter earnings report reinforces Walmart's role as a barometer for consumer health, indicating stability and potential for further upside if holiday momentum builds.\n\nGet all the details here >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

So you've you've been tracking these inventories, Lauren, and as we head into the holidays, you see a 4% rise in in.On hand inventory, but then a sharp drop in inventory, inventory coming in. I, I guess the bottom line all this for, for viewers, Lauren, is they're getting ready to do that shopping over the holidays. What do you expect to happen with pricing? I mean, does it, does it generally stay flat, go up, go down? Walk us through it. What, what would be your forecast?\n\n0:40 spk_1\n\nYeah, Josh, thanks for having me. So as you mentioned, there we, we did see that pull forward of inventory in the beginning of the year, and I really think that bodes well for prices, right? Retailers did a really good job setting the stage, bringing that inventory in uh before the price increases. So that's really gonna bode well for the consumer. So what we're hearing from retailers.Is that they're really trying to hold the line on the cost increases to get through holiday, meet their consumer where they're at this holiday, but we do believe that there may be pricing pressures going into 26.\n\n1:11 spk_0\n\nAre there any sectors though, Lauren? I mean, generally, OK, pricing they hold the line. Any sectors or verticals where you might see them rise?\n\n1:20 spk_1\n\nYeah, I would say post immediately. I think we're seeing it in home, right? Furniture, home goods, etc. I think the price increases were just too fast, too rapid, that we've already seen that kind of trickle up in both the inventory levels that we're seeing and also the prices that we're seeing in that sector.\n\n1:36 spk_0\n\nIf retailers are generally gonna hold pricing steady here, Lauren, what do we think that could mean broadly for margins?\n\n1:44 spk_1\n\nYeah, I think right similar to the results that we're seeing, I think it's going to continue to be a mixed bag, and that's something that I'm gonna continue to keep an eye on heading into getting post-holiday results because I do think the question's going to be the sales trend that we're trying to see through holiday, is that really going to come at the expense of margin.The cost increases, but also are retailers really going to need to chase that that sale and discount for heading into holiday to capture that, capture that consumer?\n\n2:15 spk_0\n\nBlackFriday, Cyber Monday coming up, Lauren, I'm just curious, have you tracked the space, how those events sort of evolved over time?\n\n2:23 spk_1\n\nYeah, like I've been in this space for 15 years and it used to be retailers lived or die by those, you know, that 4 day period. I'm now seeing it stretch out to we're really tracking what the total sales are across the month, right? We saw sales for the holiday start as beginning as early as October.And I do think although the, you know, Black Friday, Cyber Monday are going to continue to be marquee events, right, that's where we're going to see a lot of customer demand. There could potentially even be further demand post post those holidays heading into Christmas because if retailers aren't seeing the sales that they need to this upcoming weekend, right, that's going to bode well for the consumer and they're going to see deeper discounts heading into Christmas.\n\n3:01 spk_0\n\nSpeaking of the consumer, Lauren, any, any tips and tricks you might offer friends and family as they head into the holidays and get ready to do that shopping?\n\n3:09 spk_1\n\nYeah, listen, shop around. I think retailers are going to be really dynamic in their discounting strategies this year. We're gonna see probably maybe broader markdowns or so a little bit more, um, capping what they capping markdowns on what we think are going to be higher selling items. So really, you gotta be, uh, diligent out there. Also, a good alternative this year could be a gift card, right? If your budget is a certain dollar amount.Everyone loves a gift card. It kind of puts the onus on the your recipient to go out there, get the best deal they can find in the item that they want.\n\n3:39 spk_0\n\nFinal question, as you sort of heard from these retailers, it was Walmart and Layoy and Target, you know, you saw the results, you listened to conference calls. Did it generally sort of align with your views of where the sector's at and where it's headed?\n\n3:53 spk_1\n\nYeah, I think, you know what we're hearing is everyone wishes they had a magic ball heading into this holiday. I think we're going to continue to see a mixed bag. I think it's gonna be a little bit more of digging into the story, right? We're all bracing for a little bit more of those cost increases to start impacting P&Ls and something we're gonna be watching very closely post holiday.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/expect-tariffs-drive-prices-higher-223000146.html", "symbols": ["DYH.BE", "DYH.DU", "DYH.F", "DYH.HM", "DYH.MU", "HD.MX", "HD.US", "HDI.BE", "HDI.DU", "HDI.F", "HDI.HM", "HDI.MU", "HDI0.F", "HOME34.SA", "LAZ.F", "LZB.US", "TGT.MX", "TGT.US", "TGTB34.SA", "TJX.BE", "TJX.F", "TJX.MU"], "tags": ["DISCOUNTS", "HOLIDAY-SHOPPING", "PRICING", "RETAIL", "TARIFFS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.016, "neu": 0.858, "pos": 0.126}}, {"date": "2025-11-20T21:28:59+00:00", "title": "Earnings live: Walmart and Gap stocks pop on raised guidance, Nvidia erases post-earnings gains", "content": "With the greater part of third quarter earnings results in the rearview mirror, investors are looking closely at marquee reports from Nvidia (NVDA) and Walmart (WMT) this week.\n\nSo far, the Q3 earnings season is off to a positive start.

There, Walmart is optimistic too.\n\n\"Holiday is off to a pretty good start,\" Rainey said on the company's earnings call. \"Back-to-school tends to be an early indicator for how that goes, Halloween, likewise for Thanksgiving, and everything that we've seen so far makes us optimistic and encouraged about customers and members leaning into the seasonal events and holiday shopping period.\" Wed, November 19, 2025 at 10:38 PM UTC\n\nBrett LoGiurato\n\nHuang rebuts claims of AI 'bubble'\n\nNvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang took direct aim at analysts and commentators touting the risk of an AI \"bubble,\" touting how his company is poised for success in the rapidly evolving frontier.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble.

At last check, Nvidia's market cap stood around $4.42 trillion.\n\nWith so many AI stocks tied to Nvidia's fortunes, a significant swing in either direction could have wide-reaching impacts in markets.\n\n\"It's a macro indicator at this point,\" Empower chief investment strategist Marta Norton said to Yahoo Finance about Nvidia earnings. With expectations running high, Norton was skeptical about Nvidia's ability to pull out an upside surprise.\n\n\"The concern is, even if they do blow it out, that investors are still going to be skittish, just because that's the sentiment in the markets today,\" Norton said. \"So I think it is very critical.

The retail chain is struggling to significantly increase its sales as it battles waning consumer demand, and its CEO is sounding the alarm on the main sources of the problem.\n\nIn Home Depot\u2019s third-quarter earnings report for 2025, it revealed that its U.S. comparable sales increased by only 0.1% year-over-year, missing its expectations. Also, recent data from Placer.ai showed that foot traffic at Home Depot\u2019s same-store locations dropped by 0.1% during the quarter, compared to the same time period last year.\n\nAmid weak sales and declining foot traffic, Home Depot only generated an operating income of $5.3 billion, which is 1.2% less than what it earned during the same quarter in 2024.Home Depot continued to battle weak consumer demand during the third quarter of 2025.Shuttershock\n\nHome Depot CEO calls out what\u2019s causing weak demand\n\nDuring an earnings call on Nov. 18, Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said that the company\u2019s weak performance during the quarter was \u201cprimarily due to the lack of storms,\u201d which impacted multiple areas of the business such as, plywood, roofing and power generation sales.\n\nLast year, Home Depot saw a slight boost in sales during the third quarter due to consumers purchasing goods to prepare for hurricanes Helene and Milton, which devastated several southern states in September and October.\n\nDecker said that Home Depot will continue to see lower sales for the rest of the year compared to the same time period in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe storm activity and the rebuild and repair continued into Q4 (the fourth quarter) last year,\u201d said Decker. \u201cSo we'll have even more storm pressure year-over-year in Q4.\u201d\n\nRelated: Home Depot faces growing consumer boycott calls ahead of holidays\n\nHe also said that the company continues \u201cto see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund renovation projects,\u201d mainly due to current challenges in the housing market.\n\n\u201cWhat's impacting us and home improvement is the ongoing pressure in housing, in incremental consumer uncertainty,\u201d said Decker. \u201cSo take housing. I mean, housing has been soft for some time. We all know the higher interest rates and affordability concerns. But what we're seeing now is even less turnover, the housing activity is truly a 40-year low as a percentage of housing stock. I think we're at 2.9% turnover. And then home prices have started to adjust in even more markets over this past quarter.\u201d\n\nDecker said that the company is being affected by a $50 billion cumulative underspend in normal repair and remodel activity in U.S. housing.\n\nSince 2022, the average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. has remained above 6%, leading many consumers to delay purchasing new homes as affordability declines.\n\nHow the U.S. housing market performed in October 2025:\n\nThe average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in October was 6.25%, down from 6.35% in September. Existing-home sales increased by 1.2% month-over-month in October. Specifically, month-over-month U.S. home sales rose in the Midwest and South, but stayed stagnant in the Northeast and fell in the West.\r\n Sources: National Association of Realtors, Freddie Mac\n\n\"First-time homebuyers are facing headwinds in the Northeast due to a lack of supply and in the West because of high home prices,\" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun in a press release. \"First-time buyers fared better in the Midwest because of the plentiful supply of affordable houses and in the South because there is sufficient inventory.\"\n\nHome Depot CEO says customers are under pressure\n\nDecker also said during the call that concerns about the high cost of living and the job market are putting additional pressure on consumers, which has impacted demand in Home Depot stores.\n\n\u201cWe still believe we have one of the healthiest consumer segments in the whole economy,\u201d said Decker. \u201cBut again, the economic uncertainty continues largely now due to living costs, affordability's a word that's being used a lot, layoffs, increased job concerns, etcetera. So that's why we don't see an uptick in that underlying storm-adjusted demand in the business.\u201d\n\nHome Depot\u2019s weak performance during the quarter also comes after it implemented \u201cmodest\u201d price increases in its stores a few months ago in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which impacted about 50% of its products.\n\nMany consumers nationwide have been reducing their spending as prices for everyday goods go up due to tariffs.\n\nHow U.S. consumers are battling tariffs in 2025:\n\nApproximately 87% of consumers are concerned about the impact of tariffs on their finances or shopping, while 63% are worried that tariffs will raise the price of everyday goods. Also, 82% of consumers plan to change their shopping habits in response to tariffs, which includes cutting back on nonessential spending, searching for sales or coupons, delaying nonessential or big-ticket purchases and switching to lower-priced retailers or discount stores. In addition, 77% are concerned about a recession within the next year.\r\n Source: Numerator\n\n\u201cChanges in consumer sentiment are a leading indicator for changes in purchasing behaviors, and if consumers remain this pessimistic about the future of the U.S. economy, we can expect cutbacks in consumption going forward and a potential recession later this year,\u201d said Numerator Chief Economist Leo Feler in a statement in April.\n\nHome Depot recently made a major change to lure customers\n\nTo help attract customers during a time of economic uncertainty, Home Depot recently expanded its offerings for its Pro customers (residential and commercial professional contractors) through billion-dollar acquisitions.\n\nIn September, Home Depot acquired GMS, a major distributor of building products such as drywall, ceilings, steel framing and other complementary products for $5.5 billion. The move came after Home Depot acquired building material supplier SRS Distribution, which specializes in landscaping, roofing and pool construction products, for $18.25 billion in June last year.\n\nThe retailer hopes this strategy will encourage more customers to tackle large home improvement projects.\n\nMore Retail:\n\nMarshalls makes bold change to return policy ahead of holidays Walmart quietly shrinks generous offer for holiday shoppers BJ\u2019s Wholesale announces free offer for customers amid struggles\n\nDuring the earnings call, Decker said that the company will remain \u201cfocused on controlling what we can control\u201d as it battles current headwinds.\n\n\u201cOur teams are executing at a high level, and we believe we are growing market share,\u201d said Decker. \u201cWe continue to invest across the business, supporting our associates and delivering the value proposition expected by our customers.\u201d\n\nHome Depot now expects total sales for fiscal year 2025 to grow by about 3%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline by roughly 5% compared to fiscal year 2024.\n\nRelated: Home Depot raises alarm bells with unexpected closure, layoffs\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Nov 20, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

Cash flow sustains a healthy capital return, including dividends and buybacks. Analysts and institutional activity point to a robust rebound and potential for new highs in 2026. Interested in Lowe's Companies, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nLowe\u2019s (NYSE: LOW) reported mixed results and tepid guidance, but it was enough to spark a price rebound and signal a buying opportunity for investors.\n\nWhile tepid, the results and outlook affirm analysts\u2019 expectations, along with the company\u2019s cash flow and capital returns, which are driving its stock price.\n\n\u2192 Intel Could Be the Biggest Winner of TSMC\u2019s AI Bottleneck\n\nThe takeaway is that headwinds persist, but this\u00a0retail company is sustaining growth, maintaining margins, and building value for investors.\n\nAs a result, its stock price is likely to revert to the\u00a0high end of the existing trading range and potentially set new highs in early to mid-2026.\n\n\u2192 NVIDIA Just Proved the AI Boom Is Bigger Than Anyone ThoughtLowe's stock chart showing support at a critical level.\n\nLowe\u2019s Takes Share in Q3, Outperforms Competitor\n\nLowe\u2019s had a decent quarter in Q3 despite macroeconomic headwinds and the impact of 2025\u2019s less damaging hurricane season. The company reported $20.81 billion in revenue, up 3.2%, outpacing competitor Home Depot by approximately 45 basis points but falling slightly short of the consensus.\n\n\u2192 Why Intuitive Machines Is Taking Off While Broader Market Sinks\n\nThe growth was underpinned by a 0.4% comparable sales (comps) increase, which was also better than Home Depot's, as well as by strength in the services and professional businesses. Services grew by double digits, while professional business is expected to accelerate from Q3\u2019s solid levels due to acquisitions.\n\nThe margin news is mixed but favorable to shareholders. The company widened its gross margin but offset the gain with increased costs.\n\nHowever, the net result is better than expected, with the $3.06 in adjusted earnings up 5.6% compared to the 3.2% revenue growth and 11 cents better than MarketBeat\u2019s reported consensus.\n\nThe critical detail is that cash flow was sufficient to sustain balance sheet and capital returns in the face of its recent acquisition, setting the business up for strength in 2026.\n\nGuidance was also mixed but favorable to investors. Although guidance fell short of the consensus, the increases reflect management\u2019s improved confidence and align with the analysts' forecasts, easing market concerns for capital return payments.\n\nAs of mid-November,\u00a0the company\u2019s dividend yield stands at an attractive 2.75% annually, complemented by share buybacks that further boost returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company did not buy back any shares in Q3, choosing instead to focus cash flow on its acquisition, but reduced the count by more than 1.0% YTD and is expected to resume repurchases in upcoming quarters.\n\nAnalysts Forecast Robust Rebound for Lowe\u2019s Stock\n\nAnalysts' trends are also mixed, reflecting a cautious outlook; however, they remain bullish on this stock. The recent string of price target reductions aligns with the broader consensus, which forecasts a 20% upside from the critical support level, and sentiment is pegged at Moderate Buy.\n\nThe Moderate Buy rating has been in place for over a year and shows no signs of faltering. The few updates issued immediately after the release suggest that the mixed trend will continue, but no change to the overall outlook is expected.\n\nAnalysts at CFRA were quick to point out the strategic value of recent acquisitions and improved\u00a0exposure to professional business.\n\nInstitutional trends suggest that this group is buying the November price dip. Although activity has declined sequentially throughout the year, the balance is bullish in every quarter, including the first half of Q4.\n\nThe Q4-to-date activity is noteworthy because it is poised to accelerate and may gain momentum now that results have been released.\n\nLowe\u2019s Stock Confirms Support at a Critical Level\n\nLowe\u2019s stock surged about 5% following the Q3 release, rebounding sharply from lows set the day prior. The move confirms support at a critical level and indicates a high probability for continued rebound. LOW stock could continue to rise in this scenario, potentially reaching and retesting record levels in early 2026.\n\nThe article \"Lowe\u2019s Stock Price Signals a Buying Opportunity After Q3 Release\" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowe-stock-price-signals-buying-163900698.html", "symbols": ["HD.US", "LOW.US"], "tags": ["BALANCE SHEET", "DIVIDENDS", "EARNINGS", "PRICE TARGET", "RETAIL", "REVENUE GROWTH", "SHARE-BUYBACK"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.046, "neu": 0.784, "pos": 0.17}}, {"date": "2025-11-20T16:21:00+00:00", "title": "Retail Royalty: Why Walmart Continues to Eclipse Competitors", "content": "In a retail arena where giants falter and upstarts crumble, Walmart\u2019s Q3 earnings triumphantly declare: the king isn\u2019t just holding court, it\u2019s expanding the empire.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly been a mixed bag in terms of retail earnings this week. We saw home improvement retailer Home Depot post a mediocre quarterly performance that fell short of analyst expectations on profitability amid softer-than-anticipated demand. But rival Lowe\u2019s maintained its focus on operational efficiencies and Pro segments which provided an edge, leading to a more resilient bottom line despite similar macro pressures like deferred big-ticket projects.\n\nWe then heard from Walmart competitor Target, who saw recent troubles linger in the latest quarter as the company missed on revenues and posted weak comparable sales. The number of transactions declined year-over-year as well for Target, reinforcing a theme of overall cautious spending and leading the retailer to cut its full-year profit guidance ahead of a potentially tepid holiday season.\n\nAll signs pointed to the weak retail sentiment spilling over into Walmart\u2019s results, but the king of retail had other plans.\n\nWalmart\u2019s Third-Quarter Masterclass in Outperforming Peers\n\nWalmart delivered a robust fiscal third-quarter performance this morning, surpassing analyst expectations on both revenue and earnings amid resilient consumer demand for value and essentials. The company reported total revenue of $179.5 billion, up 5.8% year-over-year (+6.0% in constant currency), exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $177.14 billion by 1.3%.\n\nThe big-box retailer resumed its long history of earnings beats after a rare miss in the prior quarter. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.62, edging by our projection of $0.61 by 1.6%. Walmart\u2019s bottom line grew 6.9% year-over-year; the positive surprise was driven by market share gains across income cohorts and operational efficiencies.\n\nComparable sales showed solid growth, with Walmart U.S. comps rising 4.5% (ex-fuel), supported by a 1.8% increase in transactions and a 2.7% uptick in average ticket. This follows a 4.6% increase in the prior quarter, where e-commerce played a significant role in boosting overall performance.\n\nAnd once again, e-commerce was a standout with global sales surging 27%, fueled by store-fulfilled pickup, delivery, and marketplace expansions. Membership trends continued upward, with global membership income rising 16.7%. Advertising also shone, with global growth at 53% (including VIZIO) and Walmart Connect in the U.S. up 33% from the year-ago period.\n\nStory Continues\n\nConsumer spending patterns revealed a focus on value, with strength in groceries, health and wellness, and private brands, alongside modest gains in general merchandise like apparel and toys. Foot traffic improved, with global weekly visits exceeding 270 million, and higher-income households driving incremental gains.\n\nPositive Q3 Results Lead to Enhanced Outlook\n\nWalmart updated its fiscal 2026 outlook upward, with the company now expecting net sales growth of 4.8%-5.1% (previously 3.75%-4.75%), and adjusted EPS of $2.58-$2.63 (up from $2.52-$2.62). However, the Bentonville-based retailer said it now expects capital expenditures for the year to be approximately 3.5% of net sales, on the high end of its previous range.\n\nThese results position Walmart favorably going forward, with its digital and membership momentum providing a competitive edge in a price-sensitive environment, potentially sustaining market share gains through the holiday quarter under incoming CEO John Furner's value-focused strategy. Walmart is aggressively emphasizing deeper discounts and broader \"bigger savings\" across toys, electronics, home goods, and gifts\u2014particularly on items under $20\u2014to appeal to budget-strapped consumers.\n\nThe approach prioritizes unmatched value combined with enhanced convenience, including accelerated same-day pickup, faster delivery, and a longer promotional calendar that spreads deals beyond Black Friday.\n\nIn contrast to Target's TGT recent Q3 report, which featured weak comparative sales as well as a net sales decline that also missed estimates, Walmart's comprehensive beats highlight its broader appeal across essentials and e-commerce, underscoring resilience amid economic pressures.\n\nFor the broader retail industry, Walmart's performance signals a bifurcated consumer landscape, where value-oriented giants thrive by attracting diverse income groups while discretionary-focused peers like Target face headwinds, suggesting a continued emphasis on affordability and omnichannel strategies to navigate uncertainty.\n\nWMT shares were trading up more than 6% in early trading following the release:StockCharts\n\nImage Source: StockCharts\n\nWalmart\u2019s Tech-Driven Evolution Results in Nasdaq Listing\n\nWalmart\u2019s announcement to transfer its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Global Select Market, while retaining the ticker symbol \u201cWMT,\u201d appears driven by several strategic considerations. The primary stated reason is to better align with Walmart\u2019s evolving emphasis on technology and innovation in retail. Specifically, the move underscores shared values between Walmart and Nasdaq, including a \u201ctechnology-forward approach,\u201d delivering exceptional client value, and redefining industries through innovation.\n\nThis comes amid Walmart\u2019s broader AI push, including investments in supply chain optimization, predictive analytics, and personalized shopping tools, positioning the retailer more like a tech-enabled company rather than a traditional brick-and-mortar giant. Another likely factor is the opportunity for Walmart WMT to be added to the Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq. This could enhance liquidity, visibility among tech-savvy investors, and overall stock performance.\n\nWhile not explicitly stated in the announcement, general advantages of listing on Nasdaq over NYSE could play a role, such as potentially lower listing fees, more flexible governance rules, or greater appeal to growth-oriented investors.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s reputation as a hub for innovative companies aligns with Walmart\u2019s transformation, especially as e-commerce now accounts for a significant portion of its growth (up 27% in Q3). The timing, coinciding with strong Q3 results and an upward revision to FY2026 guidance, suggests the move is part of a broader effort to signal confidence in its tech-driven future.\n\nOverall, the outlook remains bright for the world\u2019s largest retailer.

While total revenue rose to $41.4 billion from $40.2 billion, the increase was largely attributable to approximately $900 million in sales from its recent acquisition of GMS Inc., a specialty building products distributor. Without that acquisition, total sales were essentially flat.\u200b\n\nComparable sales, a key metric tracking performance at stores open at least a year, increased just 0.2% in the quarter, with U.S. comparable sales edging up only 0.1%. Customer transactions fell 1.4%, though the average purchase amount rose to $90.39 from $88.65 in the prior-year period.\u200b\n\n\u201cWhile underlying demand in the business remained relatively stable sequentially, an expected increase in demand in the third quarter did not materialize,\u201d CEO Ted Decker said. He explained that results missed expectations primarily due to a lack of storms in the third quarter, which reduced demand for roofing materials, backup power generators and plywood, as well as an anticipated increase in demand that never materialized.\u200b\n\nRichard McPhail, Home Depot\u2019s CFO, elaborated on the housing market\u2019s role in the slowdown during the earnings call. \u201cOur customers are homeowners. They are seeing home prices now decline in more markets than rising, and we know they have job concerns,\u201d McPhail said. \u201cThis all comes together in the form of hesitation to take on larger financial commitments.\u201d\n\n\u200bHousing stuck in a rut\n\nThe U.S. housing market is currently experiencing historic stagnation. About 28 out of every 1,000 homes changed hands between January and September, the lowest home turnover rate going back to at least the 1990s, according to an analysis by Redfin. Mortgage rates have remained stuck between 6% and 7% in recent years, leading fewer people to buy and sell their homes, yet the vast majority of the market is enjoying mortgage rates much lower, secured during the pandemic before the biig inflation wave set in, starting in late 2021.\n\n\u200bMorgan Stanley Wealth Management surveyed the housing landscape in late October, with strategist Monica Guerra\u2019s team finding that over 60% of homeowners have a mortgage rate below 4.5% and the average mortgage rate is 4.1%. \u201cTo put this in context, for the last 40 years, the spread between the average effective and the prevailing mortgage rate has never been higher than 135 basis points.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHome Depot executives described customers as caught in a \u201cdeferral mindset,\u201d postponing major renovation projects while waiting for economic conditions to improve. While homeowners continue engaging in smaller cash-funded projects like painting and landscaping, they remain reluctant to take on debt for larger undertakings such as kitchen and bathroom remodels.\u200b\n\nIn response to the weaker-than-expected performance, Home Depot revised its fiscal 2025 outlook downward. The company now anticipates adjusted earnings per share will decline approximately 5% from fiscal 2024\u2019s $15.24, compared with its previous forecast of a 2% decline. The retailer maintained its sales growth forecast at approximately 3%, with GMS expected to contribute approximately $2 billion in incremental sales for the full year.\u200b\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, said Home Depot\u2019s quarter was hurt more by external factors rather than internal missteps. \u201cThe summer months were particularly challenging in this regard as consumers were actively making choices over how to spend their money, and home improvement took something of a back seat to experiences, travel, and personal indulgences,\u201d Saunders said.\u200b\n\nHome Depot\u2019s stock has fallen more than 8% over the last five days, and is down more than 13% year to date.\n\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

That could trigger a $320 billion swing in the chipmaker's market value, which would mark its largest move in post-earnings. At last check, Nvidia's market cap stood around $4.42 trillion.\n\nWith so many AI stocks tied to Nvidia's fortunes, a significant swing in either direction could have wide-reaching impacts in markets.\n\n\"It's a macro indicator at this point,\" Empower chief investment strategist Marta Norton said to Yahoo Finance about Nvidia earnings. With expectations running high, Norton was skeptical about Nvidia's ability to pull out an upside surprise.\n\n\"The concern is, even if they do blow it out, that investors are still going to be skittish, just because that's the sentiment in the markets today,\" Norton said. \"So I think it is very critical. I'm not sure, though, even if it's a strong report, that it's necessarily going to tip the scales in favor of a market rally.\" Tue, November 18, 2025 at 9:43 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock jumps on earnings, revenue beat\n\nLa-Z-Boy jumped over 5% after the close on Tuesday after the furniture maker reported earnings and revenue that were roughly in line with results a year ago but beat analysts' expectations amid a turnaround push.\n\nHere's what La-Z-Boy reported for its fiscal second quarter, compared to Wall Street consensus estimates compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nRetail sales in La-Z-Boy-owned stores increased 4% compared to the same period a year ago, and wholesale sales increased 2%.

CEO says the company needs a reset.\n\nBath & Body Works (BBWI) stock was hammered in late morning trading, falling over 23%, after the company cut its forecast and its new CEO acknowledged that the specialty personal care retailer is in need of some changes.\n\nIn the third quarter, net sales declined 1% year over year to $1.59 million, missing Wall Street's estimates for $1.63 million in net sales, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Earnings per share of $0.37 also declined year over year and fell short of expectations for $0.39 per share.\n\nThe seller of soaps and body lotions also said it doesn't expect much improvement this year, due to negative consumer sentiment. The company said it expects Q4 sales to be down in the high single digits versus last year. It also lowered its full-year net sales profit to a decline of low single digits from growth of 1.5% to 2.7% previously.\n\nFull-year earnings per share are now expected to be at least $2.83.

There, Walmart is optimistic too.\n\n\"Holiday is off to a pretty good start,\" Rainey said on the company's earnings call. \"Back-to-school tends to be an early indicator for how that goes, Halloween, likewise for Thanksgiving, and everything that we've seen so far makes us optimistic and encouraged about customers and members leaning into the seasonal events and holiday shopping period.\" Wed, November 19, 2025 at 10:38 PM UTC\n\nBrett LoGiurato\n\nHuang rebuts claims of AI 'bubble'\n\nNvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang took direct aim at analysts and commentators touting the risk of an AI \"bubble,\" touting how his company is poised for success in the rapidly evolving frontier.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" Huang said on the company's earnings call, after Nvidia's results and forecast beat estimates.\n\nHuang said Nvidia is positioned for success in \"every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\" Wed, November 19, 2025 at 10:23 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nNvidia CFO reiterates $500 billion Blackwell, Ruben revenue pipeline\n\nNvidia's earnings call is underway, and CFO Colette Kress said Blackwell sales continue to gain momentum while Ruben remains \"on track\" to ramp in the second half of 2026.\n\n\"We currently have visibility to a half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026,\" Kress said.\n\nShe later added, \"The GB300 crossed over GB200 and contributed roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue. The transition to GB300 has been seamless.\"\n\nListen to the earnings call live here.

Broadcom (AVGO) rose over 2%. Megacap tech companies \u2014 such as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG) \u2014 also ticked up after the report's release.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) shares rose over 5%.

It was a nice, solid beat and raise,\" Bernstein senior analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance just after the release.\n\nFurther details on Nvidia's visibility into future revenue will be in focus when the earnings call kicks off at 5 p.m. ET.\n\n\"The company is essentially completely being driven by data centers,\" CFRA analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton. \"The fact that we remain supply constrained here, which we think will persist through 2026, and just based on the bookings that we saw here from the hyperscalers ... means that it's going to be a fairly supply constrained through of next year, and probably well through 2027 if not all of '27.\"\n\n\"That's going to bode well for the data center revenue potential,\" Zino said. \"We think margins will be able to be sustained at that mid-70s level here for the foreseeable future.\" Wed, November 19, 2025 at 9:24 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nPalo Alto Networks beats on earnings, announces intent to acquire Chronosphere\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) stock declined by 5% in extended trading despite an earnings beat for its fiscal first quarter.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm reported earnings per share of $0.93 on revenue of $2.47 billion, a 16% revenue increase year over year. Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings per share of $0.89 and revenue of $2.46 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nPalo Alto Networks also announced it plans to acquire Chronosphere, an observability platform, for an undisclosed amount.

Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $1.22 per share on revenue of $14.85 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nSame-store sales increased 5% year over year, broadly growing across divisions. The company increased its inventory by $1 billion to $9.4 billion.\n\nTJX also lifted its sales, profit margin, and earnings per share guidance for the full year.\n\nComparable sales are expected to be up 4%, while pretax profit margin is expected to be at 11.6%. TJX expects diluted earnings per share in a range of $4.63 to $4.66, which is above the raised guidance of $4.52 to $4.57 it provided in the second quarter.\n\n\"The fourth quarter is off to a strong start, the availability of merchandise continues to be outstanding, and we are excited about the deals we are seeing in the marketplace,\" TJX Companies CEO Ernie Herrman stated.

Tue, November 18, 2025 at 9:46 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nHow important is Nvidia's earnings report to the market?\n\nNvidia's (NVDA) earnings report after the close on Wednesday will serve as a moment of truth for a market fixated on concerns about AI overbuilding, valuations, and growth.\n\nThe stock may be poised for a dramatic move after the results are posted.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Reuters reported that Nvidia options implied a 7% move in either direction in the wake of its quarterly report. That could trigger a $320 billion swing in the chipmaker's market value, which would mark its largest move in post-earnings. At last check, Nvidia's market cap stood around $4.42 trillion.\n\nWith so many AI stocks tied to Nvidia's fortunes, a significant swing in either direction could have wide-reaching impacts in markets.\n\n\"It's a macro indicator at this point,\" Empower chief investment strategist Marta Norton said to Yahoo Finance about Nvidia earnings. With expectations running high, Norton was skeptical about Nvidia's ability to pull out an upside surprise.\n\n\"The concern is, even if they do blow it out, that investors are still going to be skittish, just because that's the sentiment in the markets today,\" Norton said. \"So I think it is very critical. I'm not sure, though, even if it's a strong report, that it's necessarily going to tip the scales in favor of a market rally.\" Tue, November 18, 2025 at 9:43 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nLa-Z-Boy stock jumps on earnings, revenue beat\n\nLa-Z-Boy jumped over 5% after the close on Tuesday after the furniture maker reported earnings and revenue that were roughly in line with results a year ago but beat analysts' expectations amid a turnaround push.\n\nHere's what La-Z-Boy reported for its fiscal second quarter, compared to Wall Street consensus estimates compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nRetail sales in La-Z-Boy-owned stores increased 4% compared to the same period a year ago, and wholesale sales increased 2%. Joybird brand sales rose 1%.\n\nLa-Z-Boy opened 15 new stores during the quarter and moved to transform its portfolio. The company announced plans to exit its upholstery businesses that are not its core North American upholstery business, proposed the closure of its UK manufacturing plant, and underwent a corporate restructuring as well.\n\nFor the current quarter, the company expects sales to be in a range of $525 million-$545 million, reflecting revenue growth of 1%-4% year over year.

Medtronic reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.07, exceeding Wall Street estimates for $0.95 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $8.96 billion also surpassed estimates of $8.86 billion.\n\nMedtronic's cardiovascular portfolio revenue of $3.43 billion was a standout in the quarter, with an increase of 10.8% year over year, as was its diabetes business revenue of $757 million, which marked an increase of 10.3%. The company has been planning to spin out its diabetes business as a standalone company.\n\nThe company also raised its full-year revenue growth guidance to approximately 5.5%, from 5% previously. Medtronic raised its diluted non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to the new range of $5.62 to $5.66 compared to a range of $5.60 to $5.66 previously.

One of the industry's marquee businesses, the company posted shrinking customer purchases, slowing sales, and a cut profit guidance for the year. In essence, it issued a clear warning of a cautious consumer.\n\nWhere other retail stocks climbed after announcing new shopping partnerships with ChatGPT \u2014 in attempts to latch e-commerce to the economic rush of chatbot mania \u2014 Target's own announcement with OpenAI landed with a thud.

For the discount retailer, \"The fourth quarter is off to a strong start,\" said CEO Ernie Herrman in an earnings call earlier this week.\n\nStill, even impressive financial results from bargain brands might just confirm the idea of cash-strapped consumers, instead of bucking the trend of shoppers trading down in the hunt for deals.\n\nA mixed bag of themes also played into results from home improvement stores. Lowe's (LOW) shares surged on Wednesday after the retailer raised its full-year sales outlook from $84.5 billion to $86 billion. The company saw further expansion of sales to professional builders and posted double-digit sales growth from its online storefront.\n\nNYSE - Delayed Quote\u2022USD\n\n(HD)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n334.50\n\n-1.98\n\n(-0.59%)\n\nAt close: November 19 at 4:00:02 PM EST  HDTJX TGT\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nThe positive results contrasted sharply with those of its rival, Home Depot (HD). CFO Richard McPhail said earlier this week that Home Depot customers report remaining on the sidelines due to an uncertain economic environment, which is preventing them from committing to renovations and improvement projects. Home Depot reported lower quarterly profit compared to a year ago and decreased its outlook for the year.\n\nAs if tariffs and trade uncertainty, stubborn inflation, and stiffening competition aren't enough for retailers to contend with, they also face a shifting landscape in how consumers find and compare their products. And that brings us back to ChatGPT.\n\nIn many ways, retailers are only now catching up to tech giants in turning their apps and websites into platforms for product discovery. But the ground beneath them is shifting again. If more Americans are forgoing search bars for chatbots, it makes sense for retailers to meet their shoppers where they are.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEven if that comes with a new set of challenges: the forfeiting of advertising space, the erosion of customer loyalty, and the loss of add-on sales.\n\nThat means retailers face the double whammy of a pressured consumer and, once again, an upended shopping experience that they don't fully control.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.
