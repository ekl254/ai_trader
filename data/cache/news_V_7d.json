Investors are paying closer attention to projects with real-world applications, and this sector is drawing significant interest.\n\nLow-cap altcoins within the Neobank narrative may be undervalued. They create new opportunities for investors.\n\nWhat Potential Do Neobanks Have?\n\nA Neobank in Web3 refers to a fully digital bank that operates entirely on blockchain. It requires no physical branches. It integrates DeFi features, including self-custody, yield-bearing accounts, and Visa/MasterCard crypto spending cards.\n\nUnlike traditional neobanks, Web3 Neobanks emphasize transparency, the removal of intermediaries, and cross-chain connectivity.\n\nAccording to a report from Precedence Research, the global neobanking market reached $148.93 billion in 2024. It is projected to grow at a CAGR of 40.29% and hit $4,396.58 billion in 2034.Neobanking Market Size. Source: Precedence Research\n\nThis massive growth potential can benefit Web3 Neobanks. The first reason is the increasing adoption of stablecoin use cases. The second is a shift in investor mindset toward crypto projects with real-world utility rather than hype-driven valuations.\n\n\u201cIf stablecoin is to power Neobanks on-chain, then the current Web2 identity infra won\u2019t be able to keep up,\u201d investor Mike S predicted.\n\nCoingecko indicates that the current Neobank category has a total market capitalization of $4.19 billion, comprising 13 major projects. Mantle leads with a market cap of $3.31 billion, followed by Ether.fi at $412 million.\n\nAdditionally, Dune data indicate that physical card transaction volume from Web3 neobank projects reached a record high last month, surpassing $379 million.Crypto Card Volume. Source: Dune.\n\nAlthough the transaction volume remains small, analysts believe its growth potential is huge. Meanwhile, the link between Web3 projects and traditional payment companies is becoming stronger.\n\nCrypto investors believe Neobanks will surge thanks to AI agents and blockchain privacy. Some experts go further and predict that Neobanks will become one of the key narratives shaping crypto trends in 2026.\n\nCan Low-Cap Altcoins in the Neobank Sector Deliver Big Returns for Early Investors?\n\nDespite optimistic predictions, Coingecko\u2019s top three Neobank projects \u2014 Mantle (MNT), ether.fi (ETHFI) and Plasma (XPL) \u2014 all experienced prolonged price declines in November.\n\nHowever, several low-cap altcoins with market caps below $100 million have recently attracted fresh capital and delivered strong performances.\n\n1. Avici (AVICI)\n\nAvici (AVICI) is a self-custodial crypto banking project built on Solana. It focuses on spending cards and on-chain swaps. Over the past two months, its market cap has increased tenfold to $77 million, and its price has exceeded $6.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStalkchain reported a sharp rise in AVICI purchases in recent days. One wallet has actively accumulated about $35,000 worth of AVICI at a pace of $266 per minute.\n\nThe project announced that Avici Card reached 100,000 transactions in November. It described the card as becoming a daily habit and part of users' everyday routines. Some investors expect AVICI to get $50\u2013$100.\n\n2. Cypher (CYPR)\n\nCypher is a protocol built on Base Chain. Users can receive CYPR tokens as rewards for card-based transactions.\n\nCypher aims to create an open economic model that drives growth among brands, service providers, online influencers, AI agents, and crypto card users.\n\nThe project\u2019s market cap is currently under $10 million. Analysts believe it is undervalued.\n\nAlea Research recently highlighted several reasons for this view. Cypher processes payment value roughly twice its market cap. It also ranks second after EtherFi in card transaction volume. Low liquidity and limited listings on major CEXs have prevented significant price growth.\n\n3. Machines-cash (MACHINES)\n\nMachines-cash (MACHINES) is a newly launched crypto payment platform focused on privacy on Base. Its current market cap is under $5 million.\n\nAnalysts believe the project could attract capital inflows similar to those of AVICI, potentially achieving a 10-fold increase. Several reasons support this view. The development team includes talent with experience from MetaMask, Trust Wallet, DARPA, Flipside Crypto, Paxful, and Polygon. An advisor from AVICI also participates in the project.\n\nMachines-cash allows anonymous and secure Visa card payments. Users can transact using alias accounts that hide wallet addresses, transaction histories, and personal identities. This feature is especially attractive as interest in privacy continues to rise.\n\nMarket sentiment remains gloomy, which will significantly affect the potential of low-cap projects. Moreover, as more crypto neobanks emerge, selecting truly high-quality projects becomes increasingly challenging.\n\nJay Yu, a researcher at Pantera Capital, believes that retention, card transaction volume, and user count will determine the winners in this emerging market.\n\nRead original story Which Low-Cap Altcoins Benefit the Most From Growing Interest in the Neobank Narrative? by Nhat Hoang at beincrypto.com\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/low-cap-altcoins-benefit-most-132510763.html", "symbols": ["AVICI.US", "CYPR.US", "ETHFI.US", "MNT.US", "V.US", "XPL.US"], "tags": ["ALTCOINS", "CRYPTO", "DEFI", "NEOBANK", "PRIVACY"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.013, "neu": 0.854, "pos": 0.132}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T12:37:34+00:00", "title": "Digital Payment Today - Middle East Embedded Finance Boom Drives Financial Inclusion", "content": "The embedded finance sector in the Middle East is experiencing significant growth influenced by regulatory support, digital transformation initiatives, and the expansion of e-commerce and gig platforms.

(Forbes puts his net worth at $37 billion.) Despite his fortune, Buffett is known for living a modest lifestyle, by billionaire standards. His primary residence remains the gray stucco Nebraska home he purchased for $31,500 nearly 50 years ago, according to Forbes, and his folksy Midwestern manner and penchant for simple pleasures -- a cherry Coke, a good burger, and a good book are all near the top of the list -- have been well-documented.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop Financial Stocks\n\nDividend Aristocrats 2024\n\nWide Moat Stocks\n\nRecession Proof Stocks\n\nCheapest Value Stocks\n\nFactor-Based Stock Portfolios\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Let\u2019s dig into what really matters for anyone curious about its true value. Visa's stock has seen mixed momentum lately, with a slight drop of 0.6% in the past week and down 5.6% over the last month. However, it still holds a year-to-date gain of 4.3% and a solid 6.6% return over the past year. Some of these swings reflect recent headlines around shifting consumer spending trends and the company's push into digital payment solutions. Industry buzz about potential new fintech partnerships and evolving competitive threats has also kept investors on their toes. Visa scores just 2/6 on our undervaluation checks, which might surprise you given its blue-chip reputation. We\u2019ll walk through what that means using a few different valuation approaches, and stay tuned for an even better way to size up the stock\u2019s true worth at the end of this article.\n\nVisa scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.\n\nApproach 1: Visa Excess Returns Analysis\n\nThe Excess Returns model focuses on how much value a company creates over and above the required return expected by shareholders. It looks at the returns Visa generates on its invested capital compared to its cost of equity. This gives a clearer picture for established businesses like Visa where future growth and profitability are both important.\n\nFor Visa, the numbers are impressive. The company\u2019s Book Value stands at $19.38 per share, and analysts estimate a Stable Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $16.34 (sourced from consensus forecasts of 13 analysts). The Cost of Equity is $1.67 per share, while the Excess Return, which is the value created above what shareholders require, reaches $14.67 per share. Visa\u2019s average Return on Equity is a robust 72.09 percent, much higher than most peers. Moving forward, analysts anticipate Visa\u2019s Stable Book Value to increase to $22.67 per share (based on projections from 9 analysts).\n\nThis approach estimates Visa\u2019s intrinsic value at approximately $378.55 per share, which implies the stock is about 13.4 percent undervalued compared to recent market prices. In simple terms, the model suggests that Visa is generating meaningful value beyond what investors typically expect, pointing to an attractive long-term opportunity.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUED\n\nOur Excess Returns analysis suggests Visa is undervalued by 13.4%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover 927 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows.V Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Visa.\n\nStory continues\n\nApproach 2: Visa Price vs Earnings\n\nThe Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is preferred when valuing profitable and established companies like Visa, as it captures how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of current earnings. For businesses with strong and reliable profits, PE is especially helpful for comparing valuation across time, sectors, and peers.\n\nA company's PE ratio reflects both its expected future growth and the level of risk investors perceive. Higher anticipated growth or lower risk generally justifies a loftier PE. Conversely, in sectors with slower growth or more uncertainty, reasonable PE ratios trend lower.\n\nVisa\u2019s current PE ratio stands at 31.62x, which is well above both the Diversified Financial industry average of 13.15x and the average among key peers at 16.66x. At first glance, that premium might seem extreme, but context matters.\n\nSimply Wall St\u2019s proprietary \"Fair Ratio,\" designed to factor in Visa\u2019s unique combination of growth prospects, profitability, size, and sector risks, comes in at 20.81x. This reflects where Visa\u2019s PE should land after accounting for all the above. The Fair Ratio is often more helpful than a simple industry or peer comparison because it weighs factors specific to Visa\u2019s business and outlook.\n\nComparing Visa\u2019s actual PE of 31.62x to the Fair Ratio of 20.81x suggests the shares are priced substantially above what their fundamentals, growth, and risk profile justify at this time.\n\nResult: OVERVALUEDNYSE:V PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\n\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1430 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth.\n\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Visa Narrative\n\nEarlier, we mentioned that there's an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your unique perspective or \u201cstory\u201d about Visa, combining your assumptions about its future revenue, earnings, margins and the broader forces shaping its industry into a single, cohesive outlook.\n\nUnlike traditional methods, a Narrative links the business story to a personalized financial forecast, and then ties that forecast directly to a fair value for the stock. This approach makes your decision easier and more informed. Narratives are simple to create and explore on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share and update their views.\n\nYou can use Narratives to compare your own fair value estimate for Visa with its current market price and decide if now is the right time to buy or sell. As new data such as earnings, news or analyst updates roll in, all Narratives refresh automatically so your view stays relevant and actionable.\n\nFor example, some investors on the platform set a bullish price target for Visa at $430, betting on continued global payments growth, while others see a more cautious fair value closer to $305 due to stiffening competition and evolving regulation.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Visa?

It\u2019s a tool to leverage. Use the stock\u2019s recent weakness to step into a stake in Coca-Cola. It won\u2019t remain \u201con sale\u201d forever. Shares of credit card middleman Visa are undervalued because the company\u2019s potential is being underestimated.10 stocks we like better than Microsoft \u203a\n\nWhen investors have some idle cash to put to work, most of the time, they'll look for stocks they don't already own. And for good reason. More diversification is a good thing.\n\nIt's not always easy to do, though. Sometimes the best stocks for a particular investor are already in their portfolio. In these instances, it's not wrong to buy more of a great name you're already holding.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three fantastic stocks you may well already own, but can safely double up on, especially following each ticker's recent weakness.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) may be an aging name contending with the downside of its sheer size. But this old dog's still got plenty of fight left in it. Last quarter's top line of $77.7 billion was up 18% year over year, with $30.8 billion of that being turned into net income. If the software giant is supposed to be past its prime, somebody clearly forget to give Microsoft the message.\n\nThis continued growth is rooted in two factors that aren't apt to unravel anytime soon... if ever.\n\nThe first of these is its sheer dominance. Not only does the company remain a powerhouse within the personal productivity software space, its Windows operating system is installed on roughly two-thirds of the world's computers, according to numbers from Statcounter. This degree of resilient market penetration suggests Microsoft has become a permanent fixture within the personal computing landscape.\n\nAnd the second factor behind the company's enduring strength? Its Windows operating system actually steers consumers and corporate clients alike to other Microsoft-made products and services like its Bing search engine, LinkedIn, and even its Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nThis brute strength obviously hasn't helped investors much of late. While shares haven't exactly performed poorly since July, they've not made any net progress either, missing out on the broad market's gains during this stretch.\n\nBlame growing worries about its artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, mostly. Although nobody denies it's doing great things on the AI front, investors are increasingly concerned that Microsoft is also competing with its own artificial intelligence partner OpenAI. It's still simply spending a ton of money on artificial intelligence as well, at a time when investors are starting to question most AI stocks' steep valuations; many of these companies have yet to produce the sort of ROI on these investments that the world was hoping to see by now.\n\nNow take a step back and look at the bigger picture. This is Microsoft. There's a reason the analyst community still contends the stock's worth $631.80, which is 28% above shares' present price. That reason is the unstoppability that comes with its sheer size and its must-have offerings.\n\n2. Coca-Cola\n\nIt's been an unusually tough year for Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) shareholders. Although the stock's bounced back somewhat from its midyear lull following a couple of red flags in recent earnings reports (the second quarter's total sales volume fell slightly year over year, for instance, following a warning with its first-quarter report that then-new tariffs could take a toll on its bottom line), it's still trading below April's high while the rest of the market isn't.\n\nAs is the case with Microsoft, though, it's not like Coca-Cola is in any real existential danger. It's the world's biggest, best-known beverage name for a reason, after all.\n\nThat reason is, over the course of its 139-year existence, it's gotten very, very good at marketing. It's more than a mere drinks company -- Coca-Cola is a lifestyle brand, with its flagship soda's name and logo appearing on everything from clothing to Christmas ornaments to home decor. That's powerful.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis durable marketability is only part of the reason you might want to buy Coca-Cola shares sooner than later, though, and not even the best reason. Far more compelling is the fact that you can step into this stock while its forward-looking dividend yield stands at a solid 2.9%. And that's based on a dividend, by the way, that's now been raised for 63 consecutive years.\n\n3. Visa\n\nFinally, add credit card powerhouse Visa(NYSE: V) to your list of stocks to double up on here, if you're struggling to find a new name you like well enough to add to your portfolio.\n\nAnyone keeping long-term tabs on this company likely knows last quarter's top-line growth of 12% is a bit above long-term norms, boosted by the swell of cross-border payments the company is now able to facilitate, and has reason to. As Visa Direct's Europe chief Anastasia Serikova noted earlier this year, \"Cross-border payments have seen substantial growth due to the increase in international trade, global workforce mobility, and remittances, with total global cross-border payment flows growing at around 9% (CAGR) annually.\"\n\nThis growth engine isn't apt to sputter to a stop in the foreseeable future, either. Serikova adds, \"With the increased mobility of people, goods, and services across borders, total cross-border payments are projected to reach $250 trillion by 2027, a $100 trillion increase from 2017.\"\n\nThen there's the other, largely overlooked reason to scoop up some/more shares of Visa in the wake of its pullback from its June peak. That is, while worries about its growth prospects, regulatory headwinds, competition, and the stock's steep valuation are all credible, what's not being priced in is Visa's potential upside from the use of artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nWhereas some institutions are utilizing AI simply for the sake of using it (without any clear positive impact), a complex, digitally focused, data-rich company like this payment middleman can actually do something constructive with artificial intelligence. This includes AI-powered customer service agents, data analysis, and cybersecurity in an industry that's highly vulnerable to fraud, just to name a few. It's actually a pretty big deal that's not being fully reflected in the stock's price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

But its controlled businesses are arguably even more valuable. The crown jewel is its property and casualty insurance businesses. Given Berkshire's expertise in finding value in the financial sector, it's no surprise that it owns all three of the major credit card companies -- American Express, Visa, and Mastercard.\n\nVisa is the largest of the three, both in terms of market capitalization and transaction volume. The more cards that enter the Visa network, the greater the incentive for merchants worldwide to accept Visa, which boosts revenue that can be used to partner with even more financial institutions, in turn leading to more card issuances. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Visa is converting nearly half of its revenue into free cash flow (FCF) -- which showcases just how efficiently its business operates.\n\nV Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nVisa's main expenses are related to maintaining and expanding its network, labor, and marketing. It's a very capital-light business model, especially considering that Visa partners with financial institutions to issue cards. By not issuing its own cards, Visa doesn't have to worry about bearing the credit risk. So it's not liable for how responsibly or irresponsibly its card users manage their spending.\n\nAnother benefit is that it doesn't have to pay its users rewards. That's also done by financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase's Chase Sapphire and Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Bank of America Customer Cash Rewards card, or the Wells Fargo Active Cash card, which are all Visa cards. By comparison, American Express spends more than double on cardmember perks than it collects in annual fees (but it makes up for that shortfall in other ways).\n\nVisa passes along its free cash flow to shareholders\n\nVisa's high-margin business makes it arguably the greatest cash cow in the financial services industry.\n\nBecause Visa has low capital expenditures, it is able to convert nearly all of its operating cash flow into FCF. Visa returns that FCF to shareholders through dividends and more, importantly, stock buybacks. Metric Full Year Fiscal 2025 Net cash provided by operating activities $23.06 billion Capital expenditures $1.48 billion Free cash flow $21.58 billion Share repurchases $18.19 billion Dividends $4.63 billion\n\nData source: Visa. Fiscal year 2025 ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn Visa's 2025 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2025, the company returned roughly 4 times more cash through stock buybacks than dividends. Here lies Visa's ace in the hole. By using its FCF on buybacks over dividends, Visa consistently reduces its share count. With fewer shares to go around, Visa's earnings per share increase from the core business growing earnings as well as through a lower outstanding share count.\n\nBuybacks are a significant reason why Visa is still a good value. Despite Visa's stock price increasing over fourfold in the last decade, Visa's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still just 32.3 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is lower than its 10-year median P/E of 34.3.\n\nIf Visa were to reallocate share repurchases toward dividends, it would yield a whopping 3.6% instead of its actual yield of 0.8%. However, long-term investors would prefer Visa to continue buying back stock disproportionately and paying a relatively small dividend, as it's a better use of capital if the stock continues to perform well.\n\nYou can count on Visa in 2026 and beyond\n\nVisa checks all the boxes of a high-quality stock to buy now. Major indexes, such as the S&P 500, sport relatively expensive valuations because many of the largest companies by market capitalization have seen their stock prices rise faster than earnings, which puts pressure on these companies to deliver on expectations.\n\nVisa doesn't have that problem because its valuation is reasonable. And yet, it's not a stodgy, low-growth stock like Coca-Cola, where investors can only pencil in mid-single-digit annual earnings growth. Visa should continue to grow earnings in the low double digits per year, even if consumer spending declines.\n\nAdd it all up, and Visa is one of my highest-conviction buys for 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

The payment processor leverages network effects to generate consistent results. Visa can reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2030, even if there\u2019s a global economic slowdown. 10 stocks we like better than Visa \u203a\n\nIn less than two months, Warren Buffett will step down as CEO (but remain chairman) of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B). Under Buffett's leadership, Berkshire became the only U.S.-based nontech-focused company to surpass $1 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nIn addition to its control over insurance businesses, BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and a variety of retail, manufacturing, and services companies, Berkshire Hathaway owns positions in over 40 publicly traded companies, including a $2.7 billion stake in Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nHere's why Visa has what it takes to join Berkshire in the $1 trillion club by 2030, and why the dividend-paying growth stock is a great buy now.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nVisa's practically perfect business model\n\nVisa is a wonderful long-term investment due to its simplicity. The payment processor generates revenue from transaction volume (total dollar amount of transactions) and processed transactions (total number of transactions). This means that it makes money every time one of its cards is swiped, inserted, tapped, or processed digitally.\n\nUnlike American Express, which issues its own cards, Visa and Mastercard work with financial institutions to issue cards -- making them higher-margin businesses. However, since American Express bears the credit risk, it has more upside potential.\n\nVisa's predictability makes it an ideal fit for risk-averse investors looking for a steady growth stock. In Visa's latest fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, Visa grew net revenue by 11%, payments volume by 8%, processed transactions by 10%, and non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) earnings per share (EPS) by 14%.V Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nVisa's results barely took a hit during the pandemic (non-GAAP EPS declined by just 7%), which is a testament to the stability of its business model. By comparison, more cyclical industries within the financial sector experienced much sharper slowdowns during the pandemic.\n\nThe road to $1 trillion\n\nVisa sports a market cap of $632 billion at the time of this writing. To get to $1 trillion in five years (before the end of 2030), Visa's stock price would have to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 9.6%.\n\nIn the last six months, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has gained 12%, but Visa has tumbled over 10% -- pushing its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio down to 32.2 compared to a 10-year median P/E of 34.3.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGiven that Visa is at a reasonable valuation and isn't priced to perfection, its stock price could continue growing at the same rate as its earnings growth over the long term, unless sentiment changes and the valuation compresses.\n\nIn fact, Visa's growth rate could slow, and it could still hit $1 trillion in market value without needing its valuation to expand. Over the last five years, Visa has grown non-GAAP EPS at an average annual rate of 18%.\n\nGranted, Visa's earnings growth rate over the next five years will likely be lower than the last five. Its network is already massive, so growth may slow as the business matures. What's more, consumer spending could continue to be pressured by weakening economic growth and cost-of-living increases.\n\nAnalyst consensus estimates have Visa generating $12.81 (11.7% year-over-year growth) in fiscal 2026 EPS and $14.43 in fiscal 2027 EPS (12.7% year-over-year growth). Still, even if Visa grows in the low double digits, there's every reason to believe it can reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2030.\n\nA balanced buy for long-term investors\n\nIn today's premium-priced market, Visa stands out as a company investors can build their portfolio around. The stock is fairly priced, and the company has a clear runway for future earnings growth that is not dependent on favorable economic conditions.\n\nThe business is extremely high-margin and predictable, since Visa doesn't bear the credit risk. Visa generates a substantial amount of free cash flow, which enables it to maintain an impeccably strong balance sheet.\n\nAdd it all up, and Visa should have what it takes to join Berkshire Hathaway in the $1 trillion by 2030, and in turn, potentially beat the S&P 500 if it averages its historical annual return of 10% per year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

With networks including Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, and PayPal adopting stablecoin settlement, the use of digital dollars is becoming more established.\n\nAccording to the team, many investors continue to face challenges in understanding the structure of stablecoins, the distinctions among them, and the considerations involved in evaluating these assets. Stablecoins maintain their value through collateralization with real assets, typically fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, commodities including gold, or cryptocurrencies. Some models use algorithmic mechanisms that adjust supply and demand to support price stability.\n\nAs markets turn volatile z, investors are converting their risk-assets into digital dollars to protect value without fluctuation. Bluwhale's Stablecoin AI Agent, then, continuously scans hundreds of chains, protocols and DeFi platforms from tokenized T-bills and CeFi interest accounts to DeFi lending and liquidity pools to automatically allocate to the solution with the opportunities aligned with the stated risk-profile.\n\n\"Stablecoins have grown so fast in the past year that consumers struggle to evaluate financial opportunities as well as the technical nature for every one of them,\" said Han Jin, CEO, Bluwhale. \"We're giving millions of users the ability to earn competitive returns on digital dollars safely, automatically, and without navigating technical solutions on-chain. The future of wealth building should be powered by AI agents that identify and manage financial options for you, 24/7.\"\n\nBluwhale's AI agents analyze, evaluate and transact in real time on the blockchain to take advantage of the surplus of stablecoins in circulation during volatile markets, creating thousands of transactions and volume for DeFi applications encompassing lending and yield strategies, trigger arbitrage opportunities, as well as liquid staking pools among others.\n\nEach decision is personalized, taking into account a user's Whale Score (Bluwhale's holistic financial health metric), Bluwhale profile behavior, financial risk-appetite based on asset holdings, as well as time horizon, and overall financial goals. The result is an autonomous, always-on customized portfolio manager that supports users in managing stablecoin holdings without requiring detailed knowledge of complex financial or technical digital asset systems.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"It's a powerful flywheel as more agents serve a single user in different aspects, it leads to more AI queries on Bluwhale's network, which leads to more $BLUAI burned and financial value returned to users. Every stablecoin transaction by our AI agents becomes fuel for the Bluwhale network, consuming gas fees in $BLUAI,\" Jin added. \"Other AI agents in Bluwhale's agent store could tackle many other financial solutions for you while being trained by your profile, preferences and behavior, rebalancing portfolios, trading memecoins and lending your assets at higher yields and efficiency.\"\n\nGen Z and Stablecoins\n\nGen Z is showing increased adoption of digital dollars, with 42 percent reporting the use of stablecoins for everyday transactions, a share three times higher than that of Gen X, and 75 percent indicating a willingness to receive wages on-chain, according to 2025 data from The Motley Fool. With traditional financial systems often described as complex and less transparent, Bluwhale's Stablecoin Agent provides automated tools designed to support consistent, risk-aware activity across wallets and major exchanges.\n\nCombined with the Whale Score, which is used by 3.6 million individuals, the Stablecoin Agent helps convert routine activity into measurable financial outcomes..\n\n\"The timing is perfect,\" Jin said. \"Stablecoin integrations are accelerating across payment networks, and AI agents will soon run most on-chain financial activity. Bluwhale is leading that transformation.\"\n\nThe Stablecoin Investment Agent is available now, following Bluwhale's $BLUAI Token Generation Event.

What started as a $5.7 billion offer has swelled past $200 billion in the latest settlement proposal, a bid meant to end the fight over the fees merchants pay every time a customer swipes a card. But instead of smoothing tensions, the new deal has stirred fresh resistance from retailers and politicians, raising the possibility that premium card acceptance could be squeezed if the pact moves forward.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN. Is V fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nWalmart has already signaled that it will likely challenge the settlement, pointing back to the concerns that helped sink a previous $30 billion version last year. The National Retail Federation says the card networks just don't get it or just don't care, warning that the agreement could reshape the industry in ways that may be difficult to unwind. Restaurant groups are pushing back too, arguing that thin margins and limited bargaining power leave them particularly exposed in a system they describe as dominated by two players. Merchant coalitions continue to argue that the latest terms may not offer enough relief to the businesses footing the bill.\n\nPolitical pressure is building alongside the retail backlash. Senator Dick Durbin, a longtime critic of swipe fees and a force behind earlier debit-fee caps, said the new settlement could still fall short for both merchants and consumers at a time when household budgets remain under strain. Now the spotlight shifts to US District Court Judge Brian Cogan, who took over the case in September and is not expected to offer signals before the Dec. 12 objection deadline. Analysts note that this deal involves a mandatory class with no opt-outs, meaning any major retailer grievances could be decisive as one of the longest-running battles in payments enters another uncertain chapter.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/200-billion-swipe-fee-showdown-181809268.html", "symbols": ["3V6.F", "3V64.F", "AMZN.US", "M4I.BE", "M4I.DU", "M4I.F", "M4I.HA", "M4I.HM", "M4I.MU", "M4I0.F", "MA.MX", "MA.US", "MSCD34.SA", "V.MX", "V.US", "VISA34.SA", "WALM34.SA", "WMT.BA", "WMT.BE", "WMT.F"], "tags": ["LEGAL-BATTLE", "PAYMENTS", "RETAIL", "SETTLEMENT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.966, "neg": 0.132, "neu": 0.807, "pos": 0.06}}, {"date": "2025-11-21T17:07:00+00:00", "title": "Will AmEx's Travel &amp; Lifestyle Services Become Its Next Profit Engine?", "content": "American Express Company AXP, popularly known as AmEx, is quietly transforming its travel and lifestyle services offerings into a much bigger growth engine than most people realize.

In November 2024, an agreement was signed with the European Central Bank (ECB) for Norway to join the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross-Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system. This collaboration marks Norway's commitment to leveraging the Eurosystem's TIPS for instantaneous transactions in its national currency. The anticipated rollout of this new instant payment settlement service is slated for the first half of 2028. In December 2024, Vipps launched its NFC contactless payment solution. The solution is the first outside of Apple Pay to make use of NFC technology in iPhones for payments. Identical to Apple Pay, payment is made by tapping a phone on a payment terminal. Vipps NFC is also available for users with smartphones other than iPhone. The solution is available for nearly 70% of Norwegian bank customers. Currently, Vipps NFC only supports BankAxept cards. There are plans to include international cards in Vipps NFC to enable the solution to be used abroad. To further enhance customer convenience, in 2024, Vipps launched a new payment service for transfers between Vipps customers in the Nordic region (excluding Iceland). This service enables card-based transactions using Visa Direct and Mastercard Send and it requires both the payer and the payee to be Vipps customers. Additionally, the payee must register a recipient payment card within the Vipps app and transfers are made in the payee's currency, with funds typically accessible immediately, depending on the payee's bank.\n\nStory Continues\n\nScope\n\nCard market size in terms of number of cards, value and volume of transactions in Norway along with detailed card segmentation of debit, credit and charge cards available in the country.

Understanding these evolving forces is critical for the entire ecosystem to stay ahead of emerging threats.\"\n\n-The Industrialization of Fraud: Fraud has evolved from opportunistic crime into systematic, industrial-scale operations. Criminals are building reusable infrastructure\u2014including botnets, synthetic identities, templated scam scripts, and AI tooling\u2014that can be deployed across multiple attack types simultaneously with the efficiency and scalability of a technology enterprise.\n\n- The Monetization Playbook: Criminals are operating with sophisticated dual-speed strategies: moving slowly and deliberately when stockpiling stolen credentials to maximize reach and evade detection.\n\n- The Authenticity Crisis: The proliferation of sophisticated impersonation techniques and synthetic content is creating unprecedented challenges in verifying legitimate transactions and communications across the payment ecosystem.\n\n- The Control Erosion Problem: Traditional security controls are being systematically tested and circumvented as criminals identify and exploit gaps in legacy defense mechanisms.\n\n- The Third-Party Vulnerability Gap: The interconnected nature of the payments ecosystem creates cascading risk, with third-party providers representing critical points of vulnerability. Visa PERC reported a 41% increase in ransomware incidents affecting payments ecosystem entities from January to June 2025 compared to the previous six months, with analysis showing a 173% increase in Compromised Account Management System (CAMS) account distribution compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition to the report, Visa\u2019s Payment Ecosystem Risk team expanded on the role of AI in the report with a standalone blog on threats with agentic commerce, which can be read here.\n\n\"The reality is that everyone with access to the internet can be a fraudster,\" said Michael Jabbara, SVP, Visa Payment Ecosystem Risk and Control. \"And while the advances in technology like agentic commerce are exciting, they also pose a real risk to consumers. Being educated in these trends are one of the best ways to protect yourself in this threat landscape.\"\n\nVisa is working closely with partners across the global payments ecosystem to address these emerging forces through enhanced intelligence sharing, advanced analytics, and collaborative defense strategies. With over $13 billion dollars invested over the last five years on technology and infrastructure, including in security and trust, Visa continues to develop next-generation security technologies and risk management capabilities to protect consumers, merchants, and financial institutions.\n\nFor more information about Visa's security initiatives and risk management programs, visit Visa.com/security.\n\nAbout Visa Inc.\n\nVisa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.

V is set to gain some exciting new traction as Cash App and Afterpay launch a fresh pay-over-time feature that can be used where Visa is accepted. This upcoming pilot will roll out the Cash App Visa Debit Flex Card, allowing eligible users in the United States to break down their everyday purchases into six manageable weekly installments with a transparent finance fee.\n\nFor V, this is a significant yet understated shift. By expanding pay-over-time options across Visa\u2019s extensive network, Block is enhancing the usefulness of BNPL while also solidifying V\u2019s position in the realm of new credit solutions. Every transaction, whether it is paid in full upfront or broken down into installments, still relies on Visa\u2019s infrastructure, which helps drive volume growth as consumer preferences evolve.\n\nFor Afterpay and Cash App, this is a smart way to blend BNPL habits with everyday spending. It keeps younger users, who might be wary of credit, engaged within their financial app ecosystem. Cash App\u2019s approach to near real-time data analysis focuses on evaluating cash flow patterns, savings and other factors instead of relying on traditional credit scores. From a risk standpoint, the model keeps things in check \u2014 any repayment issues quickly pause access to new loans, reinforcing responsible use.\n\nThis shift could lead to an increase in Visa-enabled transactions among users who usually steer clear of credit cards. If this model is widely adopted by 2026, it could significantly broaden Visa's reach in the evolving landscape of consumer credit.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring?\n\nSome of V\u2019s competitors in the BNPL space include Mastercard Incorporated MA and Affirm Holdings, Inc. AFRM.\n\nMastercard is stepping up its game in the BNPL space with the introduction of Mastercard Installments. In October 2025, Mastercard and Citi expanded their Flex Pay offering, enabling cardholders to split eligible purchases into predictable installments directly at checkout.\n\nAffirm is making a significant impact in the BNPL space by embracing real-time underwriting and emphasizing predictable repayment plans. This has helped AFRM to connect with consumers looking for flexible spending options while also providing merchants with a dependable way to adapt to changing payment preferences.\n\nVisa\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\n\nOver the past year, shares of Visa have jumped 4.6% against the 14.1% fall of the industry.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, V trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24.84, above the industry average of 19.74.

This benefit enables borrowers facing today\u2019s higher interest rates to refinance with less hassle and cost in the future. Fairway Home Mortgage will begin marketing the card through select loan officers and branches this month, with a broader nationwide launch planned for January 2026.\n\n\"Mortgages and credit cards are the two most important financial products most consumers will ever use\u2014but they\u2019ve never worked together,\" said Ashin Shah, CEO & Co-Founder of Made Card. \"Traditional rewards cards have long focused on travel and luxury perks, but for most households, those rewards feel out of reach or irrelevant.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Made Card takes a different approach\u2014transforming everyday home expenses like mortgages and home improvement into meaningful financial relief and using the credit card as the foundation for a smarter platform to manage spending, saving, and running a home.\" said Christophe Van, President & Co-Founder of Made Card.\n\nCardholders have the ability to earn bonus points on their card spend by making on-time mortgage payments and earn accelerators on categories where they actually spend\u2014home improvement, home maintenance, home furnishings, gas, groceries, and utilities. In addition to mortgage-related redemptions and unique homeowner-focused rewards, points can be redeemed for traditional credit card rewards like cash-back and gift cards, as well as other more innovative rewards like credit card APR buydowns, helping homeowners reduce monthly expenses and manage their finances more effectively.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been incredibly impressed by the Made Card team from day one,\" said Tarun Gupta, Partner at Jump Capital. \"The team demonstrates a world-class combination of entrepreneurial focus with a true mastery of financial engineering, capital markets operations, and payments optimization that is rare even among industry veterans.

V and American Express Company AXP both turned in healthy earnings reports, but the forces propelling their growth continue to diverge in important ways. For investors evaluating which payment-network giant offers more durable momentum, it is not enough to simply compare headline beats. What matters now is the quality of that growth, the underlying trends shaping each business model, and how management expects the next phase of expansion to unfold.\n\nVisa remains the world\u2019s dominant card network, sitting at the center of global commerce and benefiting from long-running secular tailwinds such as digital payments, cross-border travel recovery and steady e-commerce adoption. American Express, meanwhile, continues to build on the strength of its premium customer base, leaning into strong credit metrics, high-spending cardholders and resilient fee income. With both companies navigating shifting spending patterns, investors want clarity on whose post-earnings trajectory looks stronger.\n\nLet\u2019s break down their latest quarterly performances, key operational drivers, capital deployment decisions and outlooks and estimates to see which stock appears better positioned after earnings.\n\nV vs AXP: Results Review\n\nVisa reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 EPS of $2.98, edging past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 and rising 10% from the prior year. Performance continued to benefit from robust processed transactions, steady payment volume expansion and healthy cross-border travel trends. The strength wasn\u2019t without costs, however. Operating expenses increased meaningfully, and client incentives, a contra-revenue item, jumped 17% year over year to $4.2 billion, partially offsetting the top-line momentum.\n\nOn a constant-dollar basis, Visa\u2019s payments volume climbed 9% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, supported by strength across the United States, Europe, CEMEA and LAC markets. Processed transactions reached 67.7 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Cross-border volume remained a standout highlight, growing 12% year over year.\n\nVisa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nVisa Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Visa Inc. Quote\n\nAmerican Express delivered third-quarter 2025 EPS of $4.14, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.6% and accelerating 19% year over year. The beat reflected continued spending strength from its premium customer base, rising revolving loan balances and continued card fee income growth. These tailwinds helped offset the impact of higher operating costs and increased customer engagement expenses, both of which have been trending upward.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNetwork volumes reached $479.2 billion, an increase of 9% year over year, propelled by elevated U.S. consumer activity. Total interest income advanced 8% year over year to $6.6 billion, surpassing estimates by 3.4%. AXP also saw a 5% decline in credit-loss provisions, benefiting from lower reserve build. Total expenses climbed 10% year over year to $13.3 billion, reflecting higher servicing costs and an elevated level of rewards and benefits activity.\n\nAmerican Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAmerican Express Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | American Express Company Quote\n\nOutlook & Estimates\n\nVisa\u2019s net revenues for fiscal 2026 are expected to witness low double-digit growth from $40 billion a year ago, on an adjusted nominal-dollar basis. Operating expenses are also expected to witness low double-digit growth. Management anticipates EPS will witness growth in the low double-digits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa\u2019s fiscal 2026 EPS is pegged at $12.81, an 11.7% increase, followed by a 13.3% growth next year. Similarly, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenues suggests 11% and 10.6% increases, respectively.\n\nAmerican Express anticipates revenues to increase between 9% and 10% in 2025 from the 2024 level of $65.9 billion. Management now expects EPS in the range of $15.20-$15.50, above the previously projected band of $15-$15.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXP\u2019s 2025 EPS is pegged at $15.39, a 15.3% increase, followed by a 14% growth next year. Similarly, the consensus mark for 2025 and 2026 revenues predicts 9.3% and 8.3% increases, respectively.\n\nFinancial Flexibility\n\nVisa exited the quarter with $17.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $12 billion at the end of fiscal 2024. Long-term debt fell to $19.6 billion from $20.8 billion. Operating cash flow came in at $6.2 billion for the quarter, down 6.4% year over year, though still comfortably strong. Importantly, Visa\u2019s long-term debt-to-capital ratio of 34.08% remains far below both the industry average (37.94%) and AmEx\u2019s 64.06%. Since Visa does not carry credit risk on its balance sheet, its capital structure naturally remains lighter and more flexible.\n\nAmerican Express ended the quarter with $54.7 billion in cash and equivalents, up from $40.6 billion at year-end 2024. Long-term debt increased to $57.8 billion from $49.7 billion. Operating cash flow reached $15.4 billion over the first nine months of 2025, up an impressive 85.7% year over year. While AmEx manages a more levered balance sheet by design, its liquidity profile remains solid and supported by its lending operations.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShareholder-Friendly Moves\n\nVisa returned $6.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter, $4.9 billion through buybacks and $1.2 billion via dividends. It still holds $24.9 billion in remaining buyback authorization. Visa\u2019s dividend yield of 0.83% trails AmEx\u2019s 0.96%, though Visa\u2019s repurchase potential remains significantly larger. American Express repurchased 7 million shares for $2.3 billion and paid out $600 million in dividends.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nOver the past three months, shares of Visa have declined 6.6%, underperforming both AXP and the S&P 500 Index.\n\n3-Month Price Performance ComparisonZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVisa is currently trading at 24.62X, which is below its five-year median of 26.66X. Meanwhile, AmEx is trading at 19.70X, above its five-year median of 17.27X. This suggests Visa holds more valuation-based upside.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPrice Target\n\nVisa currently trades below its average analyst price target of $402.58, implying a potential 25.3% upside from current levels. The highest target of $450 and the lowest of $327 illustrate differing risk perspectives, but the consensus direction remains clearly positive. AmEx trades below its $353.98 average target as well, but with just 3.9% upside. The gap in expected return is significant.\n\nConclusion\n\nVisa\u2019s global scale, cleaner balance sheet, lower-risk model, steadier volume growth and more attractive valuation position it for more durable upside than AmEx. Price targets reinforce that view. While AXP benefits from affluent spending trends, Visa\u2019s post-earnings pullback makes it the stronger near-term opportunity, despite both holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Time to Follow Suit?", "content": "Fundsmith\n\nQuick Read\n\nFundsmith sold its entire Mastercard (MA) position in Q3 and cut Meta Platforms by over half. Fundsmith trimmed positions aggressively in 2025 with minimal buying activity. Berkshire Hathaway built cash to $382B while Fundsmith reduced equity exposure amid high valuations. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nTerry Smith, founder of Fundsmith, has earned the nickname, the \"English Warren Buffett\" for his disciplined, long-term approach to investing in high-quality companies at reasonable prices -- much like the Oracle of Omaha himself.\n\nSince launching the Fundsmith Equity Fund in 2010, Smith has delivered strong returns by focusing on a concentrated portfolio of resilient global growth stocks, avoiding hype-driven sectors, and emphasizing businesses with high returns on capital and predictable cash flows. His straightforward style, annual shareholder letters critiquing market excesses, and personal investment in his own fund mirror Buffett's philosophy at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B). With around $20 billion in assets under management, Fundsmith remains one of the U.K.'s most successful active funds.\n\nNow, Smith appears to be echoing Buffett's recent caution. While the Oracle has built Berkshire Hathaway's cash hoard to a record $382 billion by net selling stocks for multiple quarters, Smith has spent much of 2025 trimming positions aggressively with only minor additions -- suggesting both legends see limited attractive opportunities at current valuations.\n\nA Year of Ruthless Pruning\n\nPortfolio trimming has defined Fundsmith's activity throughout 2025. Smith's strategy of \"buy good companies, don't overpay, and do nothing\" shifts to active reduction when valuations stretch too far. 13F filings and updates show consistent sales across quarters, reducing exposure to expensive names while cash balances implicitly rise.\n\nThe pattern intensified in the third quarter. Reports indicate Smith fully exited at least five positions, including completely selling out of Mastercard (NYSE:MA). He also cut Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) -- once a top holding -- by more than half and slashed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) almost in half. These moves reduced exposure to high-multiple tech leaders that drove much of the market's gains.\n\nOn the buy side, activity stayed minimal. Smith nominally added to Visa (NYSE:V) -- his fifth-largest holding today -- and made small increases in Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). These remain relatively minor positions in the roughly 30-stock portfolio, underscoring that additions were dwarfed by sales.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOverall, the fund's equity exposure contracted, with top holdings becoming even more concentrated in remaining names like Stryker (NASDAQ:SYK) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nEchoes of Omaha\n\nThis mirrors Buffett's playbook. Berkshire has been a persistent net seller, unloading big stakes in companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) while struggling to find full replacements for its capital. Both investors seem to share a view that many quality stocks -- especially in tech and consumer -- trade at premiums that leave little margin of safety. With markets hitting repeated highs amid AI enthusiasm, forward earnings multiples have expanded sharply, making it harder to justify new commitments.\n\nSmith has long warned against overpaying, even for excellent businesses. His recent letters highlight concerns over elevated valuations and concentration risks in indices dominated by a handful of mega-caps. By selling into strength and waiting, he preserves firepower for better entry points, just as Buffett hoards cash rather than chase momentum.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nBuffett and Smith signal growing distrust in today's valuations. While some billionaires place large short bets on leading AI names and others exit entirely, these value purists prefer patience over participation. Their actions suggest the market's enthusiasm may have outrun fundamentals, leaving stocks vulnerable to disappointment.\n\nRetail investors don't need to liquidate everything -- Smith and Buffett remain fully invested in their best ideas -- but protecting downside makes sense. Consider raising cash allocations, hedging concentrated positions, or stress-testing portfolios against higher rates or earnings misses. When two of the world's best wait on the sidelines, it often pays to take notice.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Revenue and adjusted net income both posted double-digit percentage increases.

Under the banner of \"Celebrating Innovation, Impact, and Ambition,\" these events brought together a powerful ecosystem of investment, ambition, and community. These landmark events were designed to be a launching pad for underrepresented founders rewriting the future of business, culture, and purpose.\n\nThe sense of momentum was palpable; founders who had been mentored over three months received continuous training and support while networking alongside peers and industry experts, culminating in this recognition and reward for their courage, creativity, and commitment to excellence. Partnerships with major brands, including Adidas, Visa, Louis Vuitton, Lennar Foundation, and Miami Community partners Black Professionals Network, the Greater Miami Convention & Tourism Bureau, provided not only capital but VIP access and credibility to startups that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nWith approximately 350 guests in attendance, Demo Day, hosted by comedian Jay Pharoah, kicked off by spotlighting 8 Black Ambition Founders who shared their unique entrepreneurial journeys and the impact the organization has had on their continued success. A memorable milestone of the evening was a powerful fireside chat featuring Black Ambition founder Pharrell Williams and Mellody Hobson, President & Co-CEO of Ariel Investments. A live luxury auction and expansive networking reception with investors, cultural leaders, corporate executives, and entrepreneurs underscored the sense of community and collective momentum.\n\n\"After five years, I look at Black Ambition as my way of paying back and paying forward what I have been blessed to achieve. These founders have proven what happens when we invest in excellence and push beyond what we've been trained to believe about work, value, and ownership.

Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava presented the Key to the County to Pharrell Williams and presented a special proclamation to Black Ambition. 27 prize winners stepped into the spotlight, telling powerful stories that connected personal history with business ambition.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe diversity of industries and backgrounds represented underscored Black Ambition's commitment to expanding the pipeline of underrepresented founders beyond\u00a0marginalized categories into game-changing ventures.\n\nDay Two's Fundable Founders Forum brought together founders and investors for masterclasses, rich storytelling, and lasting connections. A fireside chat between Steve Stoute, CEO of UnitedMasters, and moderated by Black Ambition CEO Felecia Hatcher, set the tone for a deeper dialogue around scaling ventures, legacy, and ownership. Local founders were invited to plug into the movement, reinforcing the concept that this isn't just a prize; Black Ambition is a transformative ecosystem pairing inclusion with innovation.\n\n\"You can honor your culture and dominate an industry. These entrepreneurs represent the best.\n\nAnd with the right access everything changes,\" added Felecia Hatcher. \"Five years prove our impact is real, but the future demands more. More scale. More courage. More investment in founders who are rewriting what's possible. In this climate, scaling isn't just growth\u2014it's survival, power, and legacy.\"\n\nOut of 2,500+ national applicants, twenty-seven finalists emerged, representing diverse fields including healthcare, tech, AI, fashion, agriculture, travel, food & beverage, cosmetic science and communications.\n\nAs the grand prize winners shared during the event, \"While the prize money is incredible, the win is a symbol that our hard work to close inclusivity gaps in cosmetics & personal care through science has a significant impact and scale,\" said AJ Addae of Sula Labs. Co-Grand Prize winner, Alexander Zanders of UFarmX added, \"Being honored, supported, and poured into by people that look like me and can identify with the off-thesis struggles that underrepresented founders go through not only work-wise but even mentally, means everything. \"\n\nSince its 2020 launch, Black Ambition has:\n\nSupported 28,000+ entrepreneurs through programming and content. Provided mentorship to over 1,175 founders via the Black Ambitionist accelerator. Awarded approximately $14 million in capital to 157+ startups nationwide.

The \u201cLPs\u201d who fund VCs are confronting an asset class in flux: funds have nearly twice the lifespan they used to, emerging managers face life-or-death fundraising challenges, and billions of dollars sit trapped in startups that may never justify their 2021 valuations.\n\nIndeed, at a recent StrictlyVC panel in San Francisco, above the din of the boisterous crowd crowd gathered to watch it, five prominent LPs, representing endowments, fund-of-funds, and secondaries firms managing over $100 billion combined, painted a surprising picture of venture capital\u2019s current state, even as they see areas of opportunity emerging from the upheaval.\n\nPerhaps the most striking revelation was that venture funds are living far longer than anyone planned for, creating a raft of problems for institutional investors.\n\n\u201cConventional wisdom may have suggested 13-year-old funds,\u201d said Adam Grosher, a director at the J. Paul Getty Trust, which manages $9.5 billion. \u201cIn our own portfolio, we have funds that are 15, 18, even 20 years old that still hold marquee assets, blue-chip assets that we would be happy to hold.\u201d Still, the \u201casset class is just a lot more illiquid\u201d than most might imagine based on the history of the industry, he said.\n\nThis extended timeline is forcing LPs to rip up and rebuild their allocation models. Lara Banks of Makena Capital, which manages $6 billion in private equity and venture capital, noted her firm now models an 18-year fund life, with the majority of capital actually returning in years 16 through 18. Meanwhile, the J. Paul Getty Trust is actively revisiting how much capital to deploy, leaning toward more conservative allocations to avoid overexposure.\n\nThe alternative is active portfolio management through secondaries, a market that has become essential infrastructure. \u201cI think every LP and every GP should be actively engaging with the secondary market,\u201d said Matt Hodan of Lexington Partners, one of the largest secondaries firms with $80 billion under management. \u201cIf you\u2019re not, you\u2019re self-selecting out of what has become a core component of the liquidity paradigm.\u201d\n\nThe valuation disconnect (is worse than you think)\n\nThe panel didn\u2019t sugarcoat one of the harsh truths about venture valuations, which is that there\u2019s often a huge gap between what VCs think their portfolios are worth and what buyers will actually pay.\n\nTechCrunch\u2019s Marina Temkin, who moderated the panel, shared a jarring example from a recent conversation with a general partner at a venture firm: a portfolio company last valued at 20 times revenue was recently offered just 2 times revenue in the secondary market: a 90% discount.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMichael Kim, founder of Cendana Capital, which has nearly $3 billion under management focused on seed and pre-seed funds, put this into context: \u201cWhen someone like Lexington comes in and puts a real look on valuations, they may be actually facing 80% markdowns on what they perceive that their winners or semi-winners were going to be,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201cmessy middle\u201d of venture-backed companies.\n\nKim described this \u201cmessy middle\u201d as businesses that are growing at 10% to 15% with $10 million to $100 million in annual recurring revenue that had billion-dollar-plus valuations during the 2021 boom. Meanwhile, private equity buyers and public markets are pricing similar enterprise software companies at just four to six times revenue.\n\nThe rise of AI has made things worse. Companies that chose to \u201cpreserve capital and sustain through a downturn\u201d saw their growth rates suffer while \u201cAI has caught on and the market moved past it,\u201d Hodan explained.\n\n\u201cThese companies are now in this really tricky position where if they don\u2019t adapt, they\u2019re going to face some very serious headwinds and maybe die.\u201d\n\nThe emerging manager desert\n\nFor new fund managers, the current fundraising environment is especially rough, observed Kelli Fontaine of Cendana Capital, underscoring her statement with a stunning statistic. \u201cIn the first half of this year, Founders Fund raised 1.7 times the amount of all emerging managers,\u201d she said. \u201cEstablished managers in total raised eight times the amount of all emerging managers.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because institutional LPs who committed larger sums faster than ever to VCs during the go-go days of the pandemic are now seeking quality instead, concentrating their dollars with large platform funds like Founders Fund, Sequoia and General Catalyst.\n\n\u201cThere are many folks, many peer institutions that have been investing in venture as long as we have or longer, and they became overexposed to the asset class,\u201d Grosher explained. \u201cThese perpetual pools of capital that they were known for, they started pulling back.\u201d\n\nBanks, of Makena Capital, acknowledged that while her firm has kept the number of new managers steady at one to four per year (with just two this year), the \u201cdollars that we deployed in Founders Fund is larger than we\u2019ve deployed in the emerging manager side.\u201d\n\nThe silver lining, according to Kim, is that the \u201ctourist fund managers\u201d who flooded the market in 2021 \u2013 for example, the VP at Google who decided to raise a $30 million fund because their friend did \u2013 have largely been \u201cflushed out.\u201d\n\nIs venture even an asset class?\n\nUnsurprisingly, the panel took up Roelof Botha\u2019s recent assertion at TechCrunch Disrupt that venture isn\u2019t really an asset class. They largely agreed, with some caveats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying for 15 years that venture is not an asset class,\u201d Kim said. Unlike public equities, where managers cluster within one standard deviation of a target return, things are widely dispersed in venture. \u201cThe best managers significantly outperform all the other managers.\u201d\n\nFor institutions like the J. Paul Getty Trust, that kind of dispersion has become a real headache. \u201cIt\u2019s quite challenging to make plans around venture capital because of the dispersion of returns,\u201d Grosher said. The solution has been exposure to platform funds that provide \u201csome reliability and persistence of returns,\u201d layered with an emerging manager program to generate alpha.\n\nBanks offered a slightly different view, suggesting that venture\u2019s role is evolving beyond just being \u201ca little bit of salt on the portfolio.\u201d She said, for example, that Stripe exposure in Makena\u2019s portfolio actually serves as a hedge against Visa, since Stripe could potentially use crypto rails to disrupt Visa\u2019s business. (In other words, Makena sees venture as a tool for managing disruption risk across the entire portfolio.)\n\nUnloading shares earlier\n\nAnother theme of the panel discussion was the normalization of GPs selling into up rounds, not just at distressed prices.\n\n\u201cA third of our distributions last year came from secondaries, and it wasn\u2019t from discounts,\u201d Fontaine said. \u201cIt was from selling at premiums to the last round valuation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf something is worth three times your fund, think about what it needs to do to become six times your fund,\u201d Fontaine explained. \u201cIf you sold 20% off, how much of the fund are you going to return?\u201d\n\nThe discussion brought to mind a conversation TechCrunch had with veteran Bay Area pre-seed investor Charles Hudson back in June, when he shared that investors in very young companies are being forced to think increasingly like private equity managers: optimizing for cash returns instead of home runs.\n\nAt the time, Hudson said one of his own LPs had asked him to run an exercise and calculate how much money Hudson would have made had he sold his shares in his portfolio companies at the A, B and C stages instead of holding on for the ride. That analysis revealed that selling everything at the Series A stage didn\u2019t work; the compounding effect of staying in the best companies outweighed any benefits from cutting losses early. But Series Bs were different.\n\n\u201cYou could have a north of 3x fund if you sold everything at the B,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s pretty good.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt certainly helps that the stigma around secondaries has evaporated. \u201c10 years ago, if you were doing a secondary, the unspoken thing was that, \u2018We made a mistake,\u2019\u201d Kim said. \u201cToday, secondaries are most definitely part of the toolkit.\u201d\n\nHow to raise in this environment (despite the headwinds)\n\nFor managers attempting to raise capital, the panel offered tough love, and advice. Kim recommended that new managers \u201cnetwork to as many family offices\u201d as possible, and described them as \u201ctypically more cutting edge in terms of taking a bet on a new manager.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested pushing hard on co-investment opportunities, including offering fee-free, no-carry co-investment rights as a way to get family offices interested.\n\nThe challenge for emerging managers, per Kim, is that \u201cit\u2019s going to be really hard to convince a university endowment or a foundation like [the J. Paul Getty Trust] to invest in your little $50 million fund unless you\u2019re super pedigreed \u2013 [meaning] maybe you\u2019re a co-founder of OpenAI.\u201d\n\nAs for manager selection, the panel was unanimous: proprietary networks no longer exist. \u201cNobody has a proprietary network anymore,\u201d Fontaine said flatly. \u201cIf you\u2019re a legible founder, even Sequoia is going to be tracking you.\u201d\n\nKim explained that Cendana indexes on three aspects instead: a manager\u2019s access to founders, their ability to pick the right founders, and, critically, \u201chustle.\u201d\n\n\u201cNetworks and domain expertise have a shelf life,\u201d Kim explained. \u201cUnless you\u2019re hustling to refresh those networks, to expand those networks, you\u2019re going to be left behind.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Kim pointed to one of Cendana\u2019s fund managers, Casey Caruso of Topology Ventures. Caruso, formerly an engineer at Google, will go live in hacker houses for weeks to get to know the founders there. \u201cShe\u2019s technical, so she\u2019ll actually compete with them in their little hackathons. And sometimes she wins.\u201d\n\nHe contrasted this with \u201csome 57-year-old fund manager living in Woodside. They\u2019re not going to have that kind of access to founders.\u201d\n\nAs for which sectors and geographies matter, the consensus was that AI and American dynamism dominate right now, along with fund managers who are based in San Francisco or, at least, have easy access to it.\n\nThat said, the panel acknowledged traditional strength in other regions: biotech in Boston; fintech and crypto in New York; and Israel\u2019s ecosystem \u201cnotwithstanding the current issues there,\u201d said Kim.\n\nBanks added that she\u2019s confident that consumer will have a new wave. \u201cPlatform funds have kind of put that to the side, so it feels like we\u2019re ripe for a new paradigm,\u201d she said.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/funds-20-years-old-limited-170000174.html", "symbols": ["1GOOG.MI", "1GOOGL.MI", "3V6.F", "3V64.F", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEC.F", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.BA", "GOOGL.MX", "GOOGL.SN", "GOOGL.US", "STRI.PVT", "V.MX", "V.US", "VISA34.SA"], "tags": ["EMERGING-MANAGERS", "FUNDRAISING", "INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS", "SECONDARIES", "VALUATION", "VENTURE-CAPITAL"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.029, "neu": 0.872, "pos": 0.099}}, {"date": "2025-11-18T14:00:00+00:00", "title": "Is Visa Stock a Millionaire Maker?", "content": "Key Points\n\nA network effect is arguably Visa\u2019s most attractive quality, as it helps cement the company\u2019s competitive position. Revenue and profits should keep growing in the years ahead thanks to the rising adoption of digital payments. The best scenario for investors is to buy stocks at cheap valuations. 10 stocks we like better than Visa \u203a\n\nVisa (NYSE: V) is a dominant force in the world of payments, having a leading position in card transactions. Shares have been a huge winner, as they've produced a total return of 2,550% since the company's initial public offering in 2008 (as of Nov. 15). A $38,000 investment made back then would be worth $1 million today.\n\nThe past trend is remarkable, but investors are focused on what the future holds. Can this financial stock make you a millionaire?Image source: Visa.\n\nVisa is an exceptional business thanks to a powerful network effect\n\nInvestors should identify businesses that possess an economic moat, as this is a clear indicator of a high-quality company. Visa falls into this category, thanks to a network effect. A whopping 4.8 billion Visa cards are in use across the globe, and they're accepted at over 150 million merchant locations. As the platform expands, it immediately becomes more valuable to these stakeholders. Cardholders have more places to shop, and merchants can access a larger customer base.\n\nThe presence of a powerful network effect means that Visa's competitive position is extremely difficult to disrupt. The system has worked well for merchants, consumers, and banks, and Visa has become an integral part of how the economy functions and how money moves between various parties. This setup means that it would probably require a challenger to be 10 times better to find adoption, which is obviously no easy task.\n\nThe topic of stablecoins immediately comes to mind as a potential risk factor. While this niche in the cryptocurrency space, particularly those backed by U.S. dollars, currently carry a market value of roughly $300 billion, they face an uphill battle. It will be hard to convince consumers to ditch their valuable rewards credit cards and move to stablecoins, even if merchants find value in cheaper transactions and faster settlement times.\n\nGrowth and profits should draw investor attention\n\nIn the face of this potential threat, Visa continues to hum along. Revenue in fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30) increased 11% year over year, totaling $40 billion. This was driven by an 8% gain in payments volume, which totaled a whopping $16.7 trillion. Transaction counts jumped by 10%, and cross-border volume was up 13%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nVisa benefits from the ongoing growth of the overall economy, and particularly expansion in spending activity. While this exposes the business to cyclical forces in the short term, over the long term, it has been a major tailwind. Plus, the rising adoption of digital payment methods also boosts Visa's financial performance.\n\nThe company's incredible profitability can't be overlooked. In fiscal 2025, Visa reported an unbelievable net profit margin of 50%. It rakes in billions of dollars in free cash flow each quarter, which is used to buy back shares and pay a dividend.\n\nIs Visa stock a smart buying opportunity?\n\nAfter taking a closer look at Visa, most people will come away impressed. This is a high-quality business with many favorable traits. Consequently, this company should be on the watch list, with investors ready to buy when a worthwhile opportunity presents itself. Unfortunately, this isn't the case today.\n\nThe stock is not cheap. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 32.7. Starting at a high valuation gets in the way of forward returns.\n\nFor investors to become millionaires from owning shares, Visa must also be able to grow its earnings at a rapid clip over a very long period. In the past decade, the company's net income has climbed at a compound annual rate of 12%. Given the ongoing penetration of electronic payments, Visa should be able to post double-digit profit gains for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, this isn't enough for the stock to be a millionaire-maker.

Visa is a seasoned veteran in the payment processing space, but it continues to grow at a steady pace. Both companies have interesting growth prospects, but only one has demonstrated its ability to continue growing in both good times and bad.10 stocks we like better than Robinhood Markets \u203a\n\nGrowth investing typically involves some valuation risk, as Wall Street often bakes a lot of good news into the prices of growth stocks. Long-term investors need to figure out how much of a premium they are willing to pay for the growth they expect from an investment. That's the big story when you compare discount broker Robinhood(NASDAQ: HOOD) to payment processor Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nWhat does Robinhood do?\n\nRobinhood is a discount brokerage. It has dramatically changed the industry in which it operates, effectively forcing its competitors to adopt its free trading offer. Having built a large customer base with free trades, the company has expanded its offerings as it looks to attract active investors. Some of the more innovative efforts have included cryptocurrency trading and sports betting.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Robinhood is that it is still relatively young. The initial public offering (IPO) was held in mid-2021. By that point, the worst of the coronavirus pandemic was largely over for the stock market, meaning that Robinhood's stock has only existed as a public company during a bull market. That's extra important for a broker because trading activity tends to be strongest in bull markets. The business is performing well, but it has not yet been tested by a deep market downturn.\n\nWhat does Visa do?\n\nVisa, by comparison, has been around for a considerable amount of time. The company held its IPO in early 2008, in the midst of the Great Recession. It is a payment processor that allows consumers to pay retailers with cards bearing the Visa logo. Visa collects a small fee for each transaction it processes. The company's growth has been driven by the move from cash to card payments, a transition that is still ongoing. In fact, the growth of e-commerce is an important driver, as more people are shopping online, which necessitates the use of a payment method other than cash.\n\nWhile Robinhood's history is relatively short, making it challenging to provide meaningful historical growth numbers, that's not the case with Visa. Over the past decade, Visa's revenue has advanced at an annualized clip of 11%, with earnings rising an attractive 14% a year. There's a good reason why growth investors like Visa's stock.\n\nWhat are you paying for growth?\n\nStarting with Visa, investors have a fairly good handle on what to expect from this industry-leading company. That growth is priced into the shares, which aren't cheap. The price-to-sales ratio is roughly 18.5 times, the price-to-earnings ratio is 33 times, and the price-to-book value ratio is 17.5 times. What's interesting here, however, is that the P/S and P/E ratios are below their five-year averages, with only the P/B ratio above its longer-term average.\n\nOn an absolute basis, Visa is definitely expensive. However, relative to its own historical valuation, Visa appears fairly priced overall. It might be best viewed as a growth at a reasonable price (GARP) stock at the moment. That's likely to be more attractive to investors than Robinhood.\n\nAfter a massive 280% stock price rally over the past year, Robinhood's P/S ratio is 26.5 times, its P/E ratio is 50.5 times, and its P/B ratio is nearly 13 times. The short history and lack of profitability in the early years of its public life mean there's no five-year average for P/E. However the five year average for the P/S ratio is roughly 7 times, and the longer-term average for P/B is about 2 times.\n\nThere are two takeaways for Robinhood. First, it is expensive relative to its own history, suggesting that investors are pricing in a lot of good news. This is true despite the fact that it has never been through a bear market. Bear markets can be particularly difficult for brokers. Second, Robinhood is being afforded an even higher valuation than Visa despite Visa's consistent history of growth.\n\nInvestors should probably err on the side of caution\n\nEven if you believe that Robinhood can continue to expand its business at a rapid clip, the stock already appears to price in years of growth. And the valuation suggests that there isn't much room for error, even though investors have no idea how the business will perform during a bear market.\n\nIf you are a growth investor, it is probably better to stick with a proven commodity like Visa. While the stock is pricey on an absolute basis, it appears reasonably priced on a historical basis. And it is far cheaper than untested Robinhood.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Robinhood Markets right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Robinhood Markets, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Robinhood Markets wasn\u2019t one of them.

The S&P 500 has climbed 16% over the same period, while the broader industry has slipped 6.5%. Even Visa Inc. V (up 4.4%) and Mastercard Incorporated MA (up 3.6%), typically consistent outperformers, have trailed far behind.\n\nPrice Performance \u2013 AXP, V, MA, Industry & S&P 500Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis divergence speaks to the resilience of AmEx\u2019s premium brand. Through a choppy macro backdrop, AmEx\u2019s affluent, high-spending clientele and dependable earnings engine have helped it sidestep much of the volatility seen across consumer and financial stocks. As one of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s longest-held positions, the company continues to carry the reputation of a reliable, blue-chip compounder. Still, investors are asking the natural question: after such a strong run, is there meaningful upside left?\n\nA Valuation Edge That Stands Out\n\nOne of AmEx\u2019s key strengths right now is its valuation setup. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 20.67X, comfortably below the industry average of 24.19X. Meanwhile, Visa and Mastercard command far richer premiums, with forward P/E ratios of 25.32X and 29.12X, respectively.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Makes AmEx Different?\n\nAmEx is often grouped with Visa and Mastercard, but its business model functions very differently. The company operates a closed-loop system, meaning it acts as both card issuer and bank. Unlike the pure-network models of Visa and Mastercard, AmEx earns revenues from transaction fees and interest on cardholder balances.\n\nThis dual-revenue structure gives AmEx more flexibility in shifting rate environments. It also strengthens customer relationships, since the company controls the entire payment chain end-to-end. That advantage showed up in recent results: third-quarter revenues, net of interest expense, reached $18.4 billion, up 11% year over year.\n\nIts client base is also a stabilizing asset. While many households are pulling back due to inflation and tighter borrowing standards, AmEx\u2019s affluent users continue spending on travel, dining, entertainment and lifestyle perks. That durability appeared in the numbers: network volumes rose 9% to $479.2 billion in the third quarter, fueled by steady U.S. consumer activity.\n\nManagement recently highlighted at the KBW Fintech Payments Conference that AmEx serves a demographic distinct from the typical Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) user. Rather than viewing BNPL services as direct rivals, the company sees them as complementary tools that cater to different spending tiers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne metric that truly sets AmEx apart is its return on equity of 33.4%, more than double the industry average of 16.2%. This reflects the efficiency and pricing power embedded in its model.\n\nAmEx\u2019s Estimates Move in the Right Direction\n\nAnalysts have become increasingly optimistic. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now indicates 2025 earnings growth of 15.1%, followed by another 14.1% rise in 2026. Revenue estimates for those years point to expansions of 9.3% and 8.3%, respectively, signaling broad-based momentum.\n\nUpward revisions have dominated recent analyst activity, with no downward estimate changes recorded in the past month. AmEx has also beaten earnings expectations for four consecutive quarters, generating an average surprise of 4%.\n\nAmerican Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAmerican Express Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | American Express Company Quote\n\nAmEx\u2019s Balance Sheet Strength Drives Flexibility\n\nBecause AmEx takes on lending and credit risk directly, its balance sheet is a central component of its strategy. The company ended the third quarter with $54.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and only $1.4 billion in short-term debt. Total assets increased to $297.66 billion, up from $271.5 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nIts net debt-to-capital ratio sits at just 4.9%, far below the industry average of 15.3%. This conservative structure enables AmEx to support cardholder loans, withstand credit cycles, meet regulatory needs and still return meaningful capital to shareholders.\n\nIn 2024, AmEx returned $7.9 billion through dividends and buybacks. In the third quarter of 2025 alone, the company distributed $2.9 billion.\n\nAmEx\u2019s Risks Worth Watching\n\nDespite its many strengths, AmEx is not without vulnerabilities. The company\u2019s heavy exposure to travel and entertainment spending can become a liability in economic downturns, as these categories weaken faster than essentials. Recent growth has also benefited from younger customers, Millennials and Gen Z, who tend to spend more selectively and may pull back if conditions worsen.\n\nAmEx\u2019s geographic base is another consideration. Visa and Mastercard have aggressively expanded global digital payment ecosystems, while AmEx remains comparatively domestically focused. Its dependence on lending and card volumes may also limit its ability to adapt to emerging non-card payment systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmerican Express has delivered an impressive year so far, driven by its premium customer base, strong financial discipline and differentiated closed-loop model. The company\u2019s solid revenue momentum, consistent earnings beats and upward-trending estimates underscore the durability of its franchise, even as the broader payments landscape evolves. Its valuation remains appealing relative to major peers, and its strong balance sheet provides the flexibility to navigate credit cycles while rewarding shareholders.\n\nThat said, the stock is not without risks. AmEx\u2019s heavier reliance on travel and discretionary spending, along with its more U.S.-centric footprint, introduces sensitivity to economic slowdowns and shifting consumer trends. These factors limit near-term visibility compared with the globally scaled, asset-light networks of Visa and Mastercard.\n\nBalancing its strengths with its exposure to cyclical categories, AXP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), supported by rising earnings estimates, robust profitability and sound capital management.

In the third quarter of 2025, total net revenues rose 17% year over year. The company benefited from broad-based volume gains, with cross-border travel demand standing out as a key driver. Switched transactions have steadily increased as digital payments have become more prevalent worldwide.\n\nAdditionally, Mastercard\u2019s Service segment \u2014 covering cybersecurity, data analytics and fraud solutions \u2014 has contributed to a significant layer of diversified, high-margin growth, enhancing overall profitability. In third-quarter 2025, value-added services and solutions reported net revenue growth of 25% year over year.\n\nEven though things are looking positive, the road ahead might not be as straightforward as it seems.

He favors companies with strong competitive advantages, including high barriers to entry and substantial assets. 10 stocks we like better than Visa \u203a\n\nFor decades, Warren Buffett has captivated investors' attention with Berkshire Hathaway's staggering returns. Since becoming CEO in 1965, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has delivered compound annual returns of nearly 20%. To illustrate just how mind-blowing that result is, $100 invested in the stock when Buffett took over would be worth over $5.5 million today.\n\nBuffett is stepping down as the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of this year, leaving behind a legacy unlike any other. But we can still benefit from his skills and insights by digging into Berkshire's portfolio in search of good stocks to buy.\n\nIf you have $2,500 that you're ready to invest in high-quality companies now, here are three Buffett-approved stocks you should consider scooping up.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nVisa\n\nVisa(NYSE: V) sits at the center of the global digital payments landscape. With total payment volume of over $14.2 trillion last year, Visa holds the leading market position, outpacing Mastercard and American Express.\n\nVisa's scale is unparalleled, and the company has spent decades developing its payments network. Its strong network effects only get stronger as more merchants come on board and more customers acquire Visa cards, giving it impressive staying power.\n\nStrong network effects are only one part of the equation. Visa collects a small fee on every transaction that passes through its network. Because its network has already been scaled up, its business model does not require significant capital expenditures, giving it high margins. Not only that, but it partners with banks to issue Visa-branded credit cards, and the banks hold all the credit card debt on their balance sheets, so Visa is not exposed to any credit risk.\n\nVisa directly benefits from rising digital transaction volumes, and those have been increasing as the economy grows. They also rise more rapidly during periods when inflation is higher. With its robust business model, high profit margins, and strong cash flow, Visa is well equipped to continue rewarding its shareholders.\n\nMoody's\n\nAs one of the largest credit rating agencies in the United States, Moody's(NYSE: MCO) plays a pivotal role in global credit markets. It essentially operates in a duopoly with S&P Global -- the two agencies combine to control 80% of the overall credit ratings market. Their next-closest competitor is Fitch Ratings, with a 12.5% share.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis strong market position gives Moody's incredible advantages. Its total addressable market encompasses bond and loan issuance, as well as structured finance, and is tied to global debt issuance, which includes governments, corporations, municipalities, and other entities. Global fixed income debt issuance last year exceeded $27 trillion, underscoring the massive scale of this market.\n\nMoody's business is tied to credit cycles. When interest rates rise, debt issuance tends to fall, creating a drag on its business. On the flip side, during periods of lower or falling interest rates, demand for credit tends to increase. Moody's also has a large data and analytics segment, which provides it with recurring, subscription-based revenue that can stabilize earnings when credit markets slow down.\n\nRecently, interest rates have been gradually falling, and debt issuance continues to grow. Meanwhile, corporations are increasingly turning to debt markets to finance their expansion of AI infrastructure. With its stable business, large market share, and importance to global credit markets, Moody's is another excellent stock to own for the long haul.\n\nChevron\n\nChevron(NYSE: CVX) is a behemoth in the energy industry. It has operations in exploration and production (upstream), pipelines and transportation (midstream), and refining (downstream). That integrated business model provides it with exposure across the entire oil and natural gas value chain.\n\nThe oil and natural gas drilling business is highly cyclical; its profits fluctuate in sync with the market prices of these commodities. That's where Chevron's integrated business model has its benefits. Upstream operations are exposed to commodity price shifts, but its pipelines provide it with steady cash flows. Meanwhile, its downstream segment performs well when refining margins (the differences in prices between the raw materials and finished products) are high.\n\nChevron is one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin. It also holds a portfolio of 1.78 million net acres in the Delaware and Midland basins in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. Meanwhile, it is a significant producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and produced an average of 251,000 barrels per day last year. It's also the largest producer of LNG in Australia.\n\nIt's a major player in the energy sector, which is expected to continue growing in the coming years. Its LNG business could be a beneficiary of the AI infrastructure build-out, as hyperscalers are seeking new electricity-generating capacity powered by flexible, low-carbon fuels that can be deployed quickly to support their growing data centers.\n\nAs a key player in the energy sector, Chevron is another excellent Buffett-approved stock to buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

Domino's Pizza is expected to benefit from its low prices in a time of sustained high inflation. Visa is the leading global credit card transaction processor and has numerous avenues to further growth. 10 stocks we like better than Amazon \u203a\n\nBillionaire investor Warren Buffett may be stepping down as CEO at the end of the year, but until then, we can still look at -- and learn from -- the investing portfolio he's built at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Featuring a diversified group of stocks, Berkshire's portfolio is shared with the public every quarter through its SEC filings, so it's easy to know what Buffett is buying.\n\nBuffett may have billions of dollars at his disposal, but even if you just have $1,000, you can start building a Buffett-like portfolio. In fact, you could start today by buying one share each of three Buffett stocks, and it would only cost you about $975, so you'd have some wiggle room if prices rise slightly.\n\nHere are the three stocks (in alphabetical order) and why they make a great starter \"mini-Buffett\" portfolio.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAmazon, $235/share\n\nE-commerce titan Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), a Berkshire holding since 2019, just reported its third-quarter earnings, and it did so well that its share price rose by 14%! However, it's since dropped a bit thanks to the broad tech sell-off. That makes it surprisingly the cheapest share price on this list -- even though the company, with a $2.5 trillion market cap, is by far the largest of the three.\n\nAmazon is known, of course, for its e-commerce site and its consumer-focused entertainment services, including Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Music. However, one of the company's biggest growth engines is its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based web platform. AWS is the largest cloud services provider in the world, and it keeps getting larger. In Q3, AWS sales increased by 20% year over year to $33 billion.\n\nWith demand for both cloud services and e-commerce only expected to grow in the coming years, Amazon stock should continue to climb long after Buffett's retirement.\n\nDomino's Pizza, $410/share\n\nThe largest pizza chain in the world, Domino's Pizza (NASDAQ: DPZ) is one of the newest additions to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, first appearing in Q3 2024. Subsequent buys have raised Berkshire's position to more than $1 billion.\n\nDomino's has more than doubled its annual revenue over the last 10 years to $4.8 billion, and it has more than tripled its net income to $589.5 million. However, it's also been outperforming its rivals over the short term. In its most recent quarter, the company's U.S. same-store sales growth clocked in at 5.2%, which decisively beat the 1.6% same-store sales growth of rival Papa John's, and absolutely crushed Pizza Hut's negative sales growth, which declined by about 1%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company is expected to outperform in the short term thanks to the value it offers to consumers, whose purchasing power has been hit by inflation. When various deals are factored in -- like the current \"pick any two medium two-topping pizzas for $6.99 each\" deal -- you can usually get enough Domino's pizza to feed a family of four for less than $15 in most markets. That's an unrivaled value proposition.\n\nAnother great-looking value proposition is Domino's stock. Despite the company's recent outperformance, its shares are down by about 6.7% over the past year, which means you can pick up a share of the stock -- and its current 1.6% dividend yield -- for less than Buffett likely paid. Now that's a tasty deal!\n\nVisa, $330/share\n\nCredit card brand and payments processor Visa (NYSE: V) has seen its share price rise more than 55% over the last five years. A longtime Berkshire holding, Visa stock -- along with the stock of fellow payment processor Mastercard -- has been a part of Buffett's portfolio since 2011.\n\nIn 2024, Visa processed roughly $16 trillion in payment volumes across more than 300 billion transactions worldwide. Over the last 10 years, it has grown net revenue by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% and has grown per-share earnings by an even more impressive CAGR of 17%.\n\nManagement expects to maintain its industry-leading position by continuing to expand its market share in the consumer payments space, particularly among non-card payments, as well as by tapping new opportunities in commercial payments and value-added services, like advisory services, risk management, and financial security.\n\nVisa's shareholder-friendly management has consistently raised the company's dividend each year, often by generous double-digit percentages, but its share price has been appreciating so quickly that the yield has remained fairly consistent at about 0.75% over the past decade. Consistency plus dividend increases make for a classic Buffett stock, and Visa fits the bill.\n\nDifferent companies, but the same Buffett-favored qualities\n\nAmazon, Domino's, and Visa are three very different companies, in different industries, with different paths to success, but all fit the Buffett formula of great businesses churning out reliable growth. Adding one share of each to a \"mini-Buffett\" portfolio would be a great way to allocate $1,000 and still have a little bit left over.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

In Asia, many have turned to e-wallets, QR codes, and super apps\u2014skipping physical credit cards entirely.\n\nTraditional card companies are reinventing themselves to stay ahead of the game. \u201cThese days, when people talk about \u2018cards\u2019, it\u2019s not just a piece of plastic. It\u2019s a digital network proposition where you can pay or be paid,\u201d Stephen Karpin, Visa\u2019s Asia-Pacific president, told Fortune on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, on the sidelines of the Singapore FinTech Festival, Visa revealed two new features for its regional clientele: AI-enabled payments and stablecoin settlements.\n\nThe first marks the company\u2019s expansion into agentic commerce, where consumers across Asia can tap on AI-powered agents to shop and pay on their behalf.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s release of ChatGPT catalyzed a fundamental shift in commerce, Karpin said. \u201cThe breadth with which it\u2019s transforming how one understands and finds things in the world is quite profound. Yet one of the things missing from the current state of a LLM-powered chatbot is the ability to make payment via an agent,\u201d he said.\n\nThis means that online shoppers can use AI chatbots to discover, browse and select items\u2014but can\u2019t yet use them to complete payments.\n\nCustomers can load their Visa cards on an agent system\u2014just as they might with Apple or Google Pay. They are then given the option to opt in for \u2018personalization\u2019, to receive recommendations of \u201cintelligent shopping decisions\u201d based on their past preferences.\n\nUsers are then prompted to make payment within the AI platform\u2014securely, with tokenization and authentication\u2014completing an end-to-end online shopping process.\n\nStablecoins\n\nThe second initiative is Visa\u2019s stable settlement pilot, which enables select partners to pay using stablecoins across supported blockchains. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to have a stable value, by pegging them to less volatile assets such as fiat currencies, most commonly the U.S. dollar).\n\nKarpin said that Visa had recognized the value of blockchain technology for payments since the time first emerged a decade ago. Today, more cross-border transactions than ever are taking place via stablecoins.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bWe want to make [stablecoins] one of the options to make and receive payments all around the world, when the regulatory environment is ready,\u201d Karpin added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some assets in the form of technology and capability, and want to help businesses large and small start conducting commerce in Web3.\u201d\n\nAsia\u2019s shifting payments space\n\nKarpin has worked at Visa for over a decade, cutting his teeth in the South Pacific, Southeast Asian, and Japanese markets\u2014before becoming the firm\u2019s Asia-Pacific president in 2023.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThings are shifting in Asia\u2019s payments space, he said, noting that more change has happened in the last five years as compared to the previous fifty.\n\nSuper apps\u2014single apps consolidating multiple services like ride-hailing, food delivery and digital payments\u2014is one such disruptor, he said.\n\nThey first took off in mainland China, with the founding of Alipay in 2004 and WeChat Pay in 2013. Southeast Asian tech giant Grab followed suit, launching GrabPay in 2016.\n\nBut instead of regarding super apps and e-wallets as competition, Visa is looking for ways to work with them.\n\n\u201cYou can live your life on a super app now, so we\u2019re partnering with them to digitalize the Visa credential,\u201d Karpin said.\n\nHe cited Visa\u2019s partnership with Taiwan\u2019s Line Pay as an example, which allows Taiwanese users to travel abroad and pay by scanning any QR codes connected to the Visa network.\n\nVisa is also widely accepted in global destinations beyond Asia, making it easier for long-distance travelers to make seamless payments overseas.\n\n\u201c[When traveling further abroad], you can\u2019t use a super app with a QR. We\u2019re partnering with e-wallets so you can use your phone to tap to get onto the New York subway, or buy lunch in London,\u201d Karpin said.\n\nVisa is the world\u2019s second-largest card payment organization based on the annual value of card payments transacted and the number of issued cards, after being surpassed by China\u2019s UnionPay in 2015. Yet Visa, No. 127 on the Fortune 500, leads in global transaction volume.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-leans-ai-enabled-payments-040000541.html", "symbols": ["V.US"], "tags": ["AI", "BLOCKCHAIN", "FINTECH", "PAYMENTS", "STABLECOINS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.022, "neu": 0.896, "pos": 0.082}}, {"date": "2025-11-17T02:08:00+00:00", "title": "27% of Warren Buffett's $320 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks", "content": "Key Points\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's largest stock holding remains Apple, a company that has incorporated AI into its popular tech products. Buffett has also bought shares of insurance giant Chubb and payments leader Visa. Both Chubb and Visa are using AI in fraud detection.10 stocks we like better than Apple \u203a\n\nAfter six decades leading Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett will retire from his role as CEO at the end of the year. Over his tenure, the conglomerate has absolutely trounced the market. From 1965 through 2024, Berkshire shares increased by 5,502,284% compared to a 39,054% return for the S&P 500.\n\nSome, though certainly not all, of that growth was driven by the gains of its extensive stock portfolio, which today is valued at $320 billion. Safe to say, Buffett's portfolio is still a great place to get investing ideas.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nWhile he has largely shied away from investing in tech stocks, there are some companies using artificial intelligence (AI) among Berkshire's holdings -- and three of them currently make up 27% of the portfolio.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBuffett started investing in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016, and it's now the largest position he has, at 23.9% of Berkshire's portfolio. Apple hasn't exactly been leading the pack when it comes to AI -- its rollout of Apple Intelligence started in 2024, and some promised features have been delayed until 2026 -- but it has incorporated AI technology across its product lineup. Apple devices now have AI-powered real-time text analysis, battery management optimization, and augmented reality (AR) enhancements.\n\nUnlike other major tech companies, Apple hasn't developed its own competitive AI models. Instead, it has partnered with AI companies including OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and Alphabet. It will reportedly pay Alphabet $1 billion per year to use a custom Gemini AI model to power its Siri virtual assistant.\n\nConsidering the growing concerns that the tech sectors' AI spending may have become excessive, Apple's approach could end up being more cost-effective. Apple may not perform like a growth stock anymore, but it should continue to do well for shareholders, especially given the level of brand loyalty its products generate.\n\n2. Chubb\n\nThe insurance business has been a lucrative one for Buffett. Berkshire owns several insurance companies, including Geico. In 2023 and 2024, Berkshire invested in Chubb (NYSE: CB), an American-Swiss company that provides commercial, personal, overseas general, and life insurance policies to customers worldwide.\n\nChubb is known for taking an innovative approach to its business, and its use of AI technology is one example of that. The insurer has incorporated AI to automate underwriting workflows, claims assessment and processing, and fraud detection. Earlier this month, Chubb also unveiled an AI-powered optimization engine that analyzes data and provides personalized insurance product recommendations to customers.\n\nA forward-thinking approach is great, but it's ultimately the results that matter. Chubb's combined ratio -- one of the main metrics insurance companies use to gauge their profitability -- demonstrates just how efficient it is. A combined ratio of 100% indicates that an insurer is breaking even; any figure below that indicates it's profitable. Chubb's property and casualty (P&C) combined ratio in 2024 was 86.6%, 10% better than the industry average of 96.6%.\n\nChubb currently makes up 2.5% of Berkshire's portfolio. If you're looking for more stable stocks that are benefiting from AI, you may want to add this insurance provider to yours.\n\n3. Visa\n\nVisa (NYSE: V) went public in 2008, and Buffett bought shares a few years later in 2011. That holding now makes up nearly 1% of Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nWhile AI exploded in popularity following the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, the technology had been evolving for decades before that, and Visa was an early adopter. In 1993, it became the first payment network to use AI in risk and fraud management. Visa Advanced Authorization, a real-time payment product powered by Visa's AI platform, now prevents an estimated $28 billion in fraud annually.\n\nVisa is also using AI to streamline the online shopping experience. It's developing agentic AI tools that can make purchases for LLM users based on queries about products and services, eliminating their need to visit other websites.\n\nVisa and rival Mastercard dominate their industry: The two combine to handle 90% of all payment processing outside China. This makes Visa one of the better wide-moat stocks and a fairly safe investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.
