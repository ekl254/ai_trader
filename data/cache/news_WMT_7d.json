For more live coverage of the markets, watch the full episode of Market Sunrise and visit Yahoo Finance.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nwill help us dig a bit further into what's coming up this week and much more. I'm joined by Russ Mold, investment director at AJ Bell. Russ, thanks so much for joining us.\n\n00:07 Speaker A\n\nWell, let's start with the Fed. Uh, you know, the probability of a Fed rate cut has now risen. I mean, last week I was talking about 30%, 33%, and now it's at 75% according to the Fed Watch tool. Um, what do you make of what we heard from the New York president, a Bank of New York president there? And also whether you do believe the markets are now right to believe that we will get a Fed rate cut next month?\n\n00:27 Russ Mould\n\nYeah, I think Mr. Williams is clearly being very pragmatic. We are starting to catch up on the information that we've been missing for the last couple of months owing to the US government shutdown and although opinions remain split,\n\n00:36 Russ Mould\n\nit is does seem as if there is some slow down in the US jobs market. There is some cooling there. You can see that in vacancies, weekly claims, and you can see that also in the non-farm payrolls data. We'll get a lot more of that on Friday, but there's probably just enough justification in there for the Fed to at least consider cutting and it's not just cutting this month, but if you look at the see me Fed watch service that you quoted, that's pricing in at the moment or factoring in some like 3% rates by next Christmas. So that's a full percentage point below where we are now.\n\n01:03 Speaker A\n\nNow, one of the thick key themes last week and has been for a while now is worries about an AI bubble. Um, we saw a bounce back on Friday, but do you think those fears of a AI bubble are they're still around, aren't they?\n\n01:14 Russ Mould\n\nvery, very much so. and there are more questions being raised about funding for this phenomenal amount of capital expenditure planned by the hyper scale company, companies, 420 billion this year, 500 billion, then 600 billion dollars in 2027. Will there be a return on that investment given that I'm sure Chinese competition isn't going to sleep on that even if there is substantial adoption. and then where do we sit with valuations? Again when Nvidia's market capitalization reached $5 trillion, same as the GDP of Germany. You know, that's for that does say an awful lot of value that's being provided by the 36,000 Nvidia employees compared to 84 million Germans and Nvidia's results were impressive, but there were some holes that you could pick in them in terms of the cash flow, inventories and receivables, and that came back to the funding issue. So that's probably going to be the biggest area of focus in the next one or two Nvidia quarterly numbers.\n\n01:54 Speaker A\n\nNow, uh, so we've talked about the Fed, we've talked about the bubble. The next thing I really want to talk about is Black Friday because we heard from a lot of retailers last week, kind of a mixed bag. Walmart was clearly the standout there, but what are your hopes for Black Friday?\n\n02:05 Russ Mould\n\nYeah, I mean Home Depot popped out a stinker at the same time. so it's again, we're still seeing a very, very bifurcated consumer. even if you look at the the official statistics, University of Michigan surveys down at levels below that we've seen in the last five or six US recessions.\n\n02:16 Russ Mould\n\nThe conference board survey isn't that bleak, but it's well off the peak of last November when the president was elected and way below the peak seen during his first term in office. So there are signs that some American consumers are feeling the strain. You're seeing that in some of the subprime areas particularly. But again, it's a very K-shaped economy you could argue. those at the top are doing really well, they've got assets. Those further down the pipe are feeling a lot of pressure from inflation.\n\n02:37 Russ Mould\n\nAnd we saw that politically in the November election results as well. So, I think you will see a very, very mixed set of results from retailers. But at least one thing you might argue is that Black Friday is normally pretty good for a discount. So then it's up to the retailers to manage that appropriately and preserve margins as well as generate cash flow.\n\n02:49 Speaker A\n\nI'm not going to get into your shopping list now, but let's look at earnings as well. We've got John Deere, their results out on Wednesday. Um, it's fair to say sentiment amongst farmers isn't that great right now. Am I right?\n\n03:03 Russ Mould\n\nNo, it is and I think the the presidency has been responding to that with some of the trade deals we've seen with with with other countries. Um, but equally, you know, Deer's numbers have been reflecting that. The last set of numbers back in August weren't very strong. Analysts are predicting a double digit percentage earnings per share decline for this quarter and for the year as a whole. I think there will be much more what's the company seeing going forward in terms of backlog and also in terms of tariff impact, they'll be shaping the numbers for the coming year when analysts do expect a 7-8% improvement in earnings per share across the year as a whole.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/crucial-black-friday-ai-bubble-130316114.html", "symbols": ["1NVDA.MI", "AJB.LSE", "HD.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F", "WALM34.SA", "WMT.BA", "WMT.F", "WMT.MX", "WMT.US"], "tags": ["AI-BUBBLE", "EARNINGS", "EARNINGS PER SHARE", "EARNINGS RESULTS", "FED", "INFLATION", "RETAIL", "SPLIT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.045, "neu": 0.86, "pos": 0.095}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T13:00:00+00:00", "title": "Kellanova, Walmart and Indigo Ag Partner to Advance Farmer Prosperity in Arkansas through Regenerative Agriculture", "content": "The collaboration helps rice farmers adopt regenerative farming practices and improve water stewardship\n\nCHICAGO, Nov. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Kellanova, Walmart and Indigo Ag today announced a new partnership designed to strengthen farmer prosperity through regenerative agriculture across Arkansas. Through the Source by Indigo program, the collaboration provides farmers with resources, data, and technical support to build more resilient and profitable rice farming operations across the state.\n\nThe co-investment builds on four years of partnership between Walmart and Indigo Ag, which has already helped rice farmers supplying Walmart's Great Value brand reduce emissions by over 37,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e, conserve over 11 billion gallons of water, and put more than $900,000 into farmers' pockets. Kellanova's participation expands this effort, creating new opportunities for farmers while supporting the company's commitment to sustainable sourcing and community well-being.\n\nAs farmers across the United States face mounting economic and environmental pressures, this expanded partnership helps Arkansas farmers implement more efficient practices that are better for the land and bottom lines.\n\nFarmers participating in the program receive a financial premium for every pound of rice produced using regenerative methods. These funds support new practices such as improved water management, optimized fertilizer application, and crop rotation to enhance soil quality and biodiversity.\n\n\"Kellanova is committed to building a more sustainable future for our business and the communities where we operate. Without farmers, making our iconic foods wouldn't be possible,\" said Janelle Meyers, Chief Sustainability Officer, Kellanova. \"Our Kellanova Better Days\u2122 Promise aims to advance sustainable practices and mitigate the impacts of climate change\u2014but we know we can't achieve our goals without our partners. By joining forces with Indigo Ag and Walmart, we're creating agricultural resiliency that increases farmer revenues, advances climate-smart practices, and drives long-term, systemic impact across the value chain.\"\n\nRegenerative agriculture is increasingly recognized as a powerful approach for companies seeking to lower emissions within their supply chains while creating direct benefits for farmers and their land. Source by Indigo enables companies to support these outcomes through a verified, end-to-end process aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\n\"We are excited to see our regenerative agriculture goals becoming reality. Expanding our partnership with Indigo Ag to include Kellanova reflects the scale of impact we can achieve by working together to strengthen supply chains, support farmers, and advance environmental stewardship,\" said Mikel Hancock, Senior Director, Strategic Initiatives, Sustainability at Walmart Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe partnership is creating impact for both customers and communities: advancing water conservation in Arkansas, improving soil health, and reducing costs. As each company purchases different products from shared acres, this collaboration unlocks additional cost savings for both partners and supports program scalability. Working directly with growers the program tracks progress across the system and ensures that environmental and economic benefits reach both farmers and their communities.\n\n\"We are proud to work with partners like Kellanova and Walmart to create measurable impact for farmers in Arkansas. Together, we are building prosperity from the ground up: safeguarding water resources, improving soil health, reducing emissions, and supporting farmers,\" said Dean Banks, CEO of Indigo Ag.\n\nThe Kellanova, Walmart, and Indigo Ag partnership demonstrates how collective action can deliver meaningful results for farmers and the environment. By working together, the companies are directing more resources to farmers and their land, supporting community well-being while advancing sustainable sourcing.

However, the downside is that most have already exploited their existing market opportunities and must invest heavily to expand further, a risky proposition.\n\nThis dynamic can trouble even the most skilled investors, but luckily for you, we started StockStory to help you navigate these trade-offs and uncover exceptional companies that break the mold. That said, here is one industry titan with attractive long-term potential and two that could be stalling.\n\nTwo Mega-Cap Stocks to Sell:\n\nWalmart (WMT)\n\nMarket Cap: $839.7 billion\n\nKnown for its large-format Supercenters, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is a retail pioneer that serves a budget-conscious consumer who is looking for a wide range of products under one roof.\n\nWhy Does WMT Worry Us?\n\nGross margin of 24.8% is an output of its commoditized inventory Subpar operating margin of 4.2% constrains its ability to invest in process improvements or effectively respond to new competitive threats\n\nAt $105.40 per share, Walmart trades at 37.7x forward P/E. To fully understand why you should be careful with WMT, check out our full research report (it\u2019s free for active Edge members).\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM)\n\nMarket Cap: $811.3 billion\n\nTracing its roots back to 1799 when its earliest predecessor was founded by Aaron Burr, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is a leading financial services company offering investment banking, consumer banking, commercial banking, and asset management services globally.\n\nWhy Does JPM Fall Short?\n\nScale is a double-edged sword because it limits the company\u2019s growth potential compared to its smaller competitors, as reflected in its below-average annual revenue increases of 7.9% for the last two years Net interest margin of 2.6% reflects its high servicing and capital costs Estimated tangible book value per share growth of 7% for the next 12 months implies profitability will slow from its two-year trend\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s stock price of $298.82 implies a valuation ratio of 2.4x forward P/B.

Boeing shares have made no net progress for the past eight years, largely on concerns about the design of its newer jetliners. Yet orders continue to stack up. While Apple's initial entry into the consumer-facing AI space was disappointing, the second effort slated for the year ahead is much more promising.10 stocks we like better than Walmart \u203a\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have obviously led the market higher over the past couple of years, and by extension, helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to outperform other market indexes. Indeed, AI stocks' performances almost seem to have come at everything else's expense. There's only so much investment capital to go around, after all.\n\nWith the artificial intelligence rally getting a bit long in the tooth though -- with talk of an AI bubble on the verge of popping -- it might be wise to start positioning for a rotation out of the market's most-loved technology darlings and into something more traditionally blue chippy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average would be a great place to start that search.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nHere's a closer look at three Dow stocks that could soar in 2026, and then keep soaring after that.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Walmart\n\nIt seems strange to suggest Walmart(NYSE: WMT) shares are capable of soaring. Although the stock certainly has its bullish moments, there's still only so much growth that can be achieved by selling basic consumer goods through a network of brick-and-mortar retail stores. And to be fair, Walmart's version of soaring isn't quite what it would be with names like Nvidia or IonQ.\n\nStill, given the relatively less risk and volatility Walmart brings to the table, this stock should perform surprisingly well in the year ahead for a couple of reasons.\n\nOne of those reasons was just underscored with the release of the company's fiscal third-quarter numbers. Revenue grew 5.8% year over year to $179.5 billion versus expectations of $177.4 billion for Q3 of fiscal year 2026, which ended Oct. 31, 2025. Adjusted earnings of $0.62 per share topped estimates of $0.60. Same-store sales within the United States (where Walmart does about two-thirds of its business) improved by 4.5% versus a tough year-earlier comparison of 5.3%.\n\nWere it just this one quarter it might be chalked up as a stroke of luck. It's not just this one quarter, though. This sort of growth and outperformance has been the norm for the better part of the past few years. It's a sign that the retailer's pricing, positioning, and perks are all resonating with consumers of all income demographics. Other similar retailers can't claim the same.\n\nAs for the other reason Walmart shares are set to rally in 2026 and beyond, despite the company's persistently impressive performance of late, the stock hasn't exactly reflected this. Even with the recent post-earnings leap shares are still only barely above their February peak. There's plenty of room to tack on more gains from here.\n\n2. Boeing\n\nIt's been downright agonizing to be a Boeing(NYSE: BA) shareholder since 2019. Just when it looks like the company's finally going to shake off all the misery that its new (and lauded) 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner jets have caused, a new problem seems to surface, upending the stock. Shares are currently trading right about where they were in the middle of 2017, in fact. Consistent net losses during this stretch certainly haven't helped either.\n\nThe funny thing is, despite all the company's plane-design woes, airlines continue to order more and more of them. As of the end of the third quarter Boeing's production backlog stood at record-breaking $635 billion worth of orders.\n\nData source: The Boeing Co. Chart by author.\n\nMost of these orders can be canceled, for the record. But most of them won't be, given that the average age of jetliners still in active use today is just under a record-breaking 15 years (according to the International Air Transport Association). More and more of these planes are going to need to be replaced in the foreseeable future. Indeed, Boeing expects the airline industry to take delivery of 43,600 new planes between now and 2044 just to keep up with the growing demand for air travel. For perspective, there are only a little more than 27,000 jetliners currently in airlines' active fleets.\n\nThe year ahead may be the year the industry as well as investors are finally forced to connect these dots and start pricing this bigger picture into Boeing's shares.\n\n3. Apple\n\nFinally, add Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of Dow stocks that could soar in 2026 and beyond.\n\nIt's not been a bad performer this year. In fact, Apple shares recently hit a record high.\n\nThere's no denying, however, the stock's been held back by the company's botched entry into the consumer-facing artificial intelligence (AI) space; Apple Intelligence just wasn't ready for deployment when it became available in October last year. Neither was the updated version of its AI-powered digital assistant Siri.\n\nDisappointing AI software, of course, negates the need for Apple's newest AI-capable hardware than can use it, which is why iPhone revenue only improved about 4% over the course of the past four reported quarters.\n\nOne has to assume, however, the company's going to make sure it gets it right the next time around, particularly with the rerelease of an updated Siri slated for sometime early in the coming year. This will also give consumers more time to warm up to the idea of onboard artificial intelligence tools, as well as give the company a chance to develop and introduce a cheaper version of the AI-capable iPhone 17 that launched in September.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone owners' devices continue to age, moving them closer to an eventual upgrade. UBS reported in March that the average age of an iPhone outside of China was a sky-high 37 months, pushing the limit of how long these customers will postpone the purchase of a new one.\n\nIn other words, several bullish forces are likely to converge in 2026.\n\nThe only matter that might give you pause here is the stock's recent run-up. We may be due for a small pullback, particularly if most other AI technology stocks take a corrective tumble. That could drag AAPL shares lower, too.\n\nJust don't get be too stingy. When Apple's firing on all cylinders, the stock doesn't remain on sale for too long.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walmart wasn\u2019t one of them.

For example, 64% said they\u2019ve used rewards points to pay for essentials, 50% have used \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d plans for purchases under $100, and 46% rely on credit cards to make ends meet.\n\nThe Harris Poll report also revealed how those top earners are avoiding expenses: 49% skipped a social event so they wouldn\u2019t have to split a check, 48% have pretended an app like Venmo or Zelle wasn\u2019t working to dodge a payment, and 45% held off on medical care due to the cost.\n\nAnd like most Americans, six-figure earners also report that groceries and other household essentials as well as housing and medical costs are the top expenses draining their income.\n\nIn another sign of how stretched six-figure earners feel, they are also looking for additional ways to make extra cash or save money, according to the Harris Poll.\n\nTo stay financially afloat, they are currently engaged in or considering: side hustles (61%), selling personal items (53%), skipping meals (41%), renting out all or part of their home (41%), and resorting to debt consolidation or bankruptcy (38%).\n\n\u201cThe illusion of wealth is exhausting: Many top earners say people assume they can afford it all, yet behind the image of success are quiet sacrifices: skipped purchases, delayed plans, and a fragile sense of security,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe financial strains detailed in the survey help explain why discount retailers like Walmart have reported seeing more upper-income customers shopping at their stores.\n\nMeanwhile, voters in this month\u2019s off-year elections sent a resounding message to lawmakers that affordability remains a top concern, even as inflation has cooled substantially from a 2022 peak.\n\nAnd if wealthier Americans are feeling this much anxiety, that could signal the overall economy is on shakier ground, as the top 20% of earners have been driving growth in recent years.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cThe data also show that the U.S. economy is being largely powered by the well-to-do,\u201d Moody\u2019s chief economist Mark Zandi said in September.\u00a0\u201cAs long as they keep spending, the economy should avoid recession, but if they turn more cautious, for whatever reason, the economy has a big problem.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/six-figure-earners-living-illusion-175652715.html", "symbols": ["WALM34.SA", "WMT.BA", "WMT.BE", "WMT.F", "WMT.HM", "WMT.MU", "WMT.MX", "WMT.US", "WMTD.F"], "tags": ["CONSUMER-SPENDING", "COST-OF-LIVING", "ECONOMIC-ANXIETY", "HOUSING", "INFLATION", "SPLIT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.067, "neu": 0.792, "pos": 0.141}}, {"date": "2025-11-23T16:00:00+00:00", "title": "Guru Fundamental Report for WMT", "content": "Below is Validea's guru fundamental report for WALMART INC (WMT).

(NYSE:WMT), the world's largest retailer and a key pillar of both the U.S. and global economy, is juggling uncertain consumer demand, rapid digital transformation and intense competition in 2025. Thanks to its scale and reach, the company offers a mix of defensive stability and exposure to ongoing retail innovation, making it a frequent core holding in diversified portfolios.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel could be the next AI powerhouse \u2014 join 10,000+ early backers and invest now just $0.81 per share. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with $100.\n\nCurrent Walmart Stock Overview\n\nMarket Cap: 854.21 billion dollars Trailing P/E Ratio: 38.38 Forward P/E Ratio: 33.67 1-Year Return: +29% 2025 YTD: +19%\n\nWalmart currently trades just above 107 dollars as of October 2025, sitting not far below its all-time high from earlier in the year and comfortably above last year's bottom near 72 dollars. The stock has climbed steadily over the past twelve months, delivering more than a 29 percent return in a retail environment still dealing with inflation, shifting consumer habits and uneven discretionary spending.\n\nIts premium valuation, reflected in a trailing P/E noticeably higher than historic retailer averages, suggests investors are willing to pay up for Walmart's earnings resilience and cash flow consistency. The share price has tended to move within a broader 79 to 109 dollar band, with periodic bouts of volatility as the market digests macro headlines and sector rotation.\n\nWalmart's resilience is fueled by the expansion of its omnichannel platform, which blends in-store shopping, curbside pickup, home delivery and a rapidly growing e-commerce presence. Membership and subscription efforts, along with international expansion, add further diversification. At the same time, Walmart's global sourcing footprint makes it highly sensitive to tariff changes. Any escalation in trade barriers or import costs can pressure margins and test the limits of its everyday-low-price strategy, introducing additional uncertainty for the stock.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnalyst sentiment is generally positive. According to Benzinga, 29 of 42 analysts rate Walmart as Buy or Outperform, emphasizing its digital execution, scale advantages and defensive qualities. Targets like 129 dollars from Wolfe Research and 91 dollars from Stifel highlight differing views on valuation, with several firms pointing to elevated multiples and thin margins as reasons to temper expectations unless earnings growth or margin expansion accelerate meaningfully.\n\nQuick Snapshot Table of Predictions\n\nYear Bullish Prediction Average Prediction Bearish Prediction 2025 $106.64 $103.32 $99.84 2026 $118.89 $102.91 $88.7 2027 $125.3 $113.99 $102.34 2028 $132.12 $64.28 $44.02 2029 $80.85 $73.34 $62.07 2030 $89.16 $77.11 $66.4 2031 $93.99 $85.51 $76.68 2032 $99.13 $47.79 $32.72 2033 $60.49 $54.87 $46.33 2040 $55.46 $26.51 $18.31 2050 $20.88 $18.07 $15.55\n\nThese ranges are based on CoinCodex's algorithmic models, which rely on historical price behavior, volatility trends and long-term moving averages to estimate potential paths for the stock.\n\nBull & Bear Case\n\nBull Case\n\nThe bullish view on Walmart starts with its dominant scale and omnichannel strategy. The company continues to grow global e-commerce sales while leveraging its massive store base for fulfillment, pickup and last-mile delivery, strengthening customer loyalty and helping to support digital margins over time. Market share gains in grocery, health, and international operations provide additional earnings support, especially during economic slowdowns when value-focused consumers trade down. Strategic investments in automation, logistics, and AI-driven inventory management are designed to reduce costs, improve in-stock levels and enhance the overall shopping experience, reinforcing Walmart's competitive edge. For defensive investors, the company's consistent dividend, large cash flows and broad product mix make it a reliable anchor in times of uncertainty.\n\nBear Case\n\nThe bear case emphasizes valuation, macro risks and intense competition. Near-term technical readings from CoinCodex point to a cautious backdrop, with only about half of recent trading days closing higher and sentiment skewing toward fear. With a trailing P/E well above typical retail norms, some investors worry Walmart may be priced for perfection, leaving it vulnerable if earnings growth slows or margins come under pressure. Competition from Amazon, discount grocers and international retailers continues to challenge Walmart's pricing power, particularly in e-commerce and lower-margin regions. Inflation, wage increases and ongoing investments in technology and logistics can compress profitability, especially if Walmart is forced to absorb higher costs to maintain its low-price reputation.\n\nWalmart Stock Price Prediction for 2025\n\nBullish Prediction: 106.64 dollars Average Prediction: 103.32 dollars Bearish Prediction: 99.84 dollars\n\nCoinCodex's models suggest that Walmart could see flat to slightly lower performance by the end of 2025, with price action trading within a relatively narrow band. Risk indicators, including subdued sentiment and mixed technical signals, suggest investors are looking for clearer confirmation of sustained consumer strength and margin recovery. Inflation, wage costs and valuation remain the key near-term headwinds, even as Walmart's diversified revenue streams provide some insulation from a broad retail downturn.\n\nWalmart Stock Price Prediction for 2026\n\nBullish Prediction: 118.89 dollars Average Prediction: 102.91 dollars Bearish Prediction: 88.7 dollars\n\nBy 2026, CoinCodex projections indicate Walmart could resume a more traditional, steady-growth trajectory. This outlook assumes continued progress on cost discipline, ongoing global expansion and further consolidation of its leadership in omnichannel retail. The range of outcomes reflects uncertainty around how effectively Walmart can manage overseas execution risks, navigate competition and turn its heavy tech and logistics investments into sustained margin improvement. Volatility is likely to persist, but patient investors may see gradual upside if macro headwinds ease.\n\nWalmart Stock Price Prediction for 2030\n\nBullish Prediction: 89.16 dollars Average Prediction: 77.11 dollars Bearish Prediction: 66.4 dollars\n\nLooking out to 2030, the forecasts anticipate Walmart remaining a central player in global retail, supported by its logistics network, digital ecosystem and dividend profile. The bullish scenario assumes successful scaling of automation, improved profitability from e-commerce, and continued gains in higher-margin categories like advertising, memberships and services. The more cautious views bake in the possibility that disruptive competitors, regulatory changes, or macro shocks could cap returns and compress valuations. Even so, models generally see Walmart as a long-term survivor and leader, just with more modest upside than some high-growth tech names.\n\nInvestment Considerations\n\nWalmart stands out as a core holding for defensive investors and income seekers, thanks to its global scale, strong brand recognition and reliable dividends. Its leadership in grocery and everyday essentials provides a cushion against consumer spending downturns, while its digital initiatives and international operations offer structural growth drivers.\n\nHowever, the current valuation leaves less room for error. Upside may be limited if earnings and margins only grow in line with expectations rather than surprising to the upside. Key risks include persistent inflation, wage and logistics cost pressures, intensifying competition from Amazon and discounters, and friction in global supply chains or tariff policy. For investors comfortable with these trade-offs and seeking steady exposure to a retail giant rather than explosive growth, Walmart can still play a valuable role as a long-term, lower-volatility component of a diversified portfolio.\n\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market\n\nWhen evaluating any stock price forecast, it's wise to think about portfolio balance and not rely on a single company's trajectory. Markets shift quickly, and putting all of your capital into one sector or stock can increase risk. Many investors are turning to platforms that open the door to real estate, professional financial advice, fixed-income products, and even self-directed retirement options. These tools make it easier to diversify, smooth out volatility, and build wealth across multiple asset classes over time.\n\nArrived Homes\n\nBacked by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds\n\nFor those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial\n\nSelf-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nSoFi Alt Investments\n\nSoFi gives members access to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.\n\nRange Wealth Management\n\nRange Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold\n\nFor investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\n\nSee Next:\n\nThe \u2018ChatGPT of marketing' just opened a $0.81 per share round \u2014 10,000+ investors are already in.

Borderline useless to me.\n\nMy nearly 65,000 followers on X and LinkedIn gave me better insight \u2014 with a side of sass. I appreciated it.\n\nBut when push came to shove, the most eloquent answer came from Walmart CFO John David Rainey to me on Yahoo Finance (video above).\n\nI asked him point-blank why Walmart is shredding Target. While he didn't mention Target by name \u2014 a no-no within old companies like Walmart and Coca-Cola (KO) \u2014 what he said made a lot of sense.\n\n\"I think there's historically this notion that maybe there's a trade-off between value and convenience,\" Rainey said. \"And I think at Walmart, that's a bit of a false choice. We can provide both of those, and we're demonstrating that. And that's one of the reasons that we're gaining so much [market] share.\"\n\nRainey noted that consumers have been seeking value for the past couple of quarters. \"It stands to reason if times are getting more difficult or budgets are being strained more, you're only going to become more choiceful, more value seeking,\" Rainey said. \"And so, customers we see are looking to do business with companies that provide that value, that give them the convenience that they've come to know and expect. That's why we are consistently executing well.\"\n\nTherein lies the problem for Target as it attempts to have a better 2026 than 2025 while new CEO Michael Fiddelke slides in.\n\nWalmart \u2014 by way of 4,700-plus US stores \u2014 is regularly delivering orders to people's houses in less than 30 minutes. By year-end, Walmart's US stores will be within a three-hour reach of 95% of the population. Walmart has leveraged its mighty financial position to invest aggressively in its supply chain, allowing it to be a more trusted destination for shoppers than Target.\n\nCouple that with a significantly expanded e-commerce assortment and a low-price commitment, and you have Walmart a country mile ahead of Target in meeting customers with how they shop nowadays.\n\nTo be fair, Amazon (AMZN) is doing this too \u2014 I was blown away by Amazon's supply chain projects when I caught up with CEO Andy Jassy a few months ago in New York City. There are real structural reasons why it feels like your Amazon package is showing up faster than ever before \u2014 and it's more than robots.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAll of this explains why Target announced this week that it will increase its capital expenditures by 25% next year. It called out a lot of investments to spruce up stores. But let me tell you \u2014 if Target doesn't invest a huge chunk in its supply chain to improve shipping times and online shopping, then 2026 will be financially disastrous again.\n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure if Target could close the competitive gap with Walmart at this point, but I wish them well in their pursuit.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

(NYSE:WMT) factored into the discussion due to two reasons: its earnings report and the decision to transfer its listing to the NASDAQ stock exchange. Cramer had plenty to say about both developments. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s fiscal third-quarter earnings report saw the firm post $179.5 billion in revenue and $0.62 in adjusted earnings per share to beat analyst estimates. The firm also raised its full-year sales growth guidance to 4.8% and 5.1% from an earlier 3.75% to 4.75%. Previously in the week, the CNBC TV host had spent quite some time discussing Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s major announcement that its CEO Doug McMillon would leave the role and hand over the baton to John Furner. He discussed the firm's turnaround under McMillon and added that he wanted to meet the new Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) CEO to form a conclusive opinion about him. In this appearance, Cramer kept the faith with the firm and shared key insights about its NASDAQ transfer:I Get Very Excited About Walmart (WMT) When I Hear About Tariffs Not Being Bad, Says Jim Cramer\n\n\"Right but at the same time we know that they overestimated how badly the tariffs would hit them.

Cramer believes that Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) plays an important role in the economy to ensure that Americans can buy affordable groceries. He has praised the firm's strategy to launch its in-house products of brands that it perceives as being too expensive. However, with Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)'s shares down 4.7% over the last month, the CNBC TV host has admitted that the stock has disappointed him.

This is ugly, but Lang thinks the heavy selling has finally stopped, given that ICE seems to have stabilized over the\u2026 past week after tagging the April low\u2026 At the same time, the Relative Strength Index, the RSI, see this, it\u2019s just coming off extremely oversold levels. Very bullish.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ICE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Delayed for more than a month by the government shutdown, the Census Bureau is scheduled to issue the figures on Tuesday.\n\nRetail demand proved resilient over the summer, probably helping to fuel an acceleration in economic growth during the third quarter. At the same time, there\u2019s a risk that consumer outlays will cool as many employers temper hiring.\n\nMoreover, discretionary spending is being supported mostly by upper-income shoppers enjoying the fruits of the year\u2019s stock market rally. For those further down the income ladder, the higher cost of many staple items is taking a toll.\n\nThe latest University of Michigan data show consumers have the dimmest views of their personal finances since 2009, and see the probability of losing their jobs at the highest in five years.\n\nIn the retail space, companies including Walmart Inc. and Gap Inc. have reported strong quarterly sales as well as success in appealing to higher-income shoppers. Yet Home Depot Inc. warned that many consumers are putting remodeling projects and big-ticket purchases on hold.\n\nOther key US data in the coming week include the producer price index and durable goods orders for September, as well as weekly jobless claims.

Firms are mostly seeking ways to cut costs by adopting technology and trimming hiring.

The Bank of Canada expects 0.5% expansion on an annualized basis, and has said it believes rates are at \u201cabout the right level\u201d as long as the economy and inflation evolve in line with its forecasts.\n\nTraders in overnight swaps currently see just a slim, 3% chance of a rate cut at the central bank\u2019s Dec. 10 meeting.

The data will give a sense of how consumption and external demand are holding up across North Asia.\n\nAttention shifts mid-week to Australia and New Zealand. Australia\u2019s October CPI will show whether price pressures remain elevated enough for the Reserve Bank to stay on an extended hold. Third-quarter construction data, due the same day, will highlight the impact of lower borrowing costs on the building pipeline.\n\nIn Wellington, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to lower borrowing costs again to bring its official cash rate to 2.25%, a near 3-1/2 year low. Singapore\u2019s industrial production figures and the Philippines\u2019 budget balance are also on the calendar.\n\nAttention turns to Seoul on Thursday, where the Bank of Korea is set to leave rates unchanged at 2.5%. The same day, New Zealand reports third-quarter retail sales and ANZ business surveys, key to measuring how easier monetary conditions are feeding through to households and firms.\n\nThe week concludes with a data-heavy Friday. Japan\u2019s Tokyo CPI, labor-market data, retail sales and industrial production will offer a comprehensive snapshot of how households and manufacturers are coping with tighter monetary settings and a weaker yen. South Korea\u2019s industrial production and the Philippines\u2019 trade balance are also on tap.\n\nTaiwan posts preliminary third-quarter GDP and India closes the week with its third-quarter growth print ahead of a long-awaited trade pact with the US.\n\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for Asia\n\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\n\nPublic finances will dominate the headlines in Europe. Most prominent will be the UK, where Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivers a budget after weeks of speculation that have roiled financial markets and \u2014 according to survey data \u2014 unsettled business sentiment.\n\nReeves needs to find as much as \u00a330 billion ($39 billion) in extra funds to restore stability to the public finances. Having floated the prospect of income tax increases that would have broken pre-election promises, she dialed back on that and is now likely to take other steps to achieve her goal.\n\nCzech lawmakers on Wednesday will start discussing a draft budget for 2026 that may indicate an outlook for the fiscal deficit.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgarian lawmakers may approve their own finance bill for 2026 in the coming week \u2014 the country\u2019s first budget to be denominated in euros \u2014 amid criticism from experts and the opposition that debt levels are rising rapidly while the deficit, at the European Union\u2019s 3% threshold, is unrealistic.\n\nAnd in Romania, the government may approve a set of reforms likely to include spending cuts for the public administration through a fast-track procedure in parliament.\n\nTurning to the euro zone, Germany\u2019s closely watched Ifo business confidence index will be released on Monday, with only a slight improvement in sentiment anticipated for Europe\u2019s largest economy.\n\nAll four of the region\u2019s biggest economies will publish inflation numbers on Friday. Germany and France are predicted to see acceleration, with no change for Italy and a slowdown in price growth in Spain.\n\nSeveral European Central Bank officials are scheduled to speak, including President Christine Lagarde in Bratislava on Monday.

The Bank of Israel is expected to cut by 25 basis points to 4.25%, according to economists in a Bloomberg survey. Nigeria is poised to reduce its benchmark by 100 basis points on Tuesday, to 26%, after inflation slowed more than expected in October to 16%. In Ghana, where annual inflation has cooled to a more than four-year low, policymakers are predicted to cut borrowing costs for a third straight meeting \u2014 by 325 basis points to 18.25% \u2014 after a surprise 350-point reduction in September.\n\nLatin America\n\nThere\u2019s very little chance that Mexico\u2019s mid-month consumer prices report on Monday will either cement or derail the central bank\u2019s 12th straight rate cut at next month\u2019s meeting \u2014 33 of 35 economists in Citi\u2019s most recent survey expect just that on Dec. 18.\n\nHeadline inflation is taking a bumpy path down to Banxico\u2019s year-end forecasts \u2014 though the core readings have been less cooperative \u2014 and policymakers are much more focused on the risk of a recession after output contracted in the third quarter.\n\nPerhaps of greater interest to Mexico watchers, Banxico\u2019s inflation report on Wednesday may present downward revisions to growth and inflation projections as a mix of US tariffs, trade uncertainty and fiscal retrenchment batter Latin America\u2019s No. 2 economy.\n\nExpect Brazil\u2019s mid-month consumer prices data on Wednesday to offer more evidence that the central bank\u2019s take-no-prisoners, scorched-earth monetary policy is working. Brazil will also post its broadest inflation gauge \u2014 the IGP-M general price index \u2014 for November.\n\nThe week will offer check-ins on the labor markets of four of the region\u2019s bigger economies. Unemployment in Brazil has been running at a record low 5.6% since July, and joblessness in Mexico and Colombia are below long-term levels as well, while holding above average in Chile.\n\nThe highlight of a light week in Argentina is September GDP-proxy data, certain to reflect the sharp selloff of local assets in the run-up to the Oct. 26 midterm election.\n\nA third-quarter contraction seems likely, and analysts surveyed by the central bank anticipate 3.9% growth in 2025, down from July\u2019s forecast of 5%.\n\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for Latin America\n\n--With assistance from Andrew Atkinson, Carla Canivete, Jeremy Diamond, Mark Evans, Robert Jameson, Laura Dhillon Kane, Swati Pandey, Piotr Skolimowski and Monique Vanek.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPermabull Tom Lee Sees Bitcoin as High as $200,000 by January\u2019s End Weed Drinks That Get You Very, Very High Could Be Gone Soon The Dirty Secret of Biodegradable Plastic Cutting Ties With China Is Harder Than Companies Expected The New Requirement for MBAs Seeking Consulting Jobs: AI Proficiency\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-retail-sales-proving-resilient-210000292.html", "symbols": ["GPS.US", "WMT.US"], "tags": ["ECONOMIC-GROWTH", "INFLATION", "LABOR-MARKET", "RATES", "RETAIL"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.714, "neg": 0.065, "neu": 0.869, "pos": 0.066}}, {"date": "2025-11-22T18:47:00+00:00", "title": "Beloved retailer makes comeback after closing 100s of stores", "content": "In the 1980s and 1990s, there was no better place to see and be seen than the mall, and like most of us, we'd visit regularly to find that perfect look.\n\nIn the 80s, that meant fluorescent colors popularized by Sonny Crockett on Miami Vice. In the 1990s, that meant shopping at iconic stores like American Eagle, Abercrombie & Fitch, and, of course, The Gap.\n\nGap Stores helped define the American casual look, popularizing khakis, tees, and white shirts. It was a go-to store for people in their teens, twenties, and thirties, which enabled it to become a nationwide retailer boasting over 2,000 U.S. locations and more than 500 international stores.\n\nGap Inc. at a glance:\n\nFounded: 1969, San Francisco, CA\r\n Source: Gap Inc.

Store count: 2,486\r\n Source: Gap 10-Q SEC filing Employees: 82,000\r\n Source: Macrotrends\n\nNowadays, The Gap looks very different. Fashion changed, e-commerce started taking a toll on indoor malls (where most Gap stores are located), and low-cost rivals, from H&M to big-box Goliath Walmart, began offering similar options for less money.\n\nAs a result, foot traffic and sales at Gap stores dipped, leading the company to close 80% of its Gap namesake stores to focus on other store brands, including its low-price fast-fashion Old Navy brand.\n\nThe changes have shifted the company's retail focus and arguably better positioned it for an impressive comeback this year.The Gap is making a comeback this year as fashion shifts away from athleisure wear.Photo by Alex Bierwagen on Unsplash\n\nThe Gap has a storied history\n\nThe Gap has seen plenty of apparel trends come and go. Its first store opened in 1969 in San Francisco, and over the years, it's had to reinvent itself to continue winning over shoppers.\n\nInitially, the retailer sold Levi's jeans to young adults aged 13 to 25; however, The Gap's product line shifted toward khakis and shirts in the 1990s under the leadership of CEO Millard \u201cMickey\u201d Drexler.\n\nMore Retail Stocks:\n\nCostco CFO makes rare pricing promise Home Depot faces growing consumer boycott calls ahead of holidays Target\u2019s efforts to make amends with customers hit a snag Amazon lawsuit could be a warning to other employers\n\nDrexler successfully orchestrated a major expansion that grew The Gap\u2019s store count from about 1,100 in 1990 to 2,548 stores in 2000. He expanded the company's success by launching the highly popular Old Navy and Banana Republic retail store brands, enabling the company to target shoppers of different ages and income levels.\n\nSince Drexler left in 2002, however, Gap's namesake stores have struggled. The company attempted to turn things around with an ill-conceived brand refresh in 2010, which ditched its iconic blue square logo, only to have to abandon the move after customers revolted quickly.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stores continued to experience declining market share as tastes shifted and rivals encroached on its territory, including players like Walmart and Target, which made major pushes to target younger shoppers with brands specially designed for them, such as Walmart's No Boundaries.\n\nGap\u2019s situation has been further complicated by the embrace of e-commerce for apparel and its impact on indoor malls, where most of The Gap stores were located.\n\nGap gets hit by changing customer behavior\n\nMany indoor malls were struggling before the Covid pandemic, including large national chains that served as anchor tenants at these malls. Walmart\u2019s major expansion in the 1980s and 1990s dealt a significant blow to the likes of Sears and Kmart, for example, which was intensified by the rise of online shopping.\n\nSears and Kmart closed thousands of stores before they went bankrupt (Kmart merged with Sears in 2005, and the merged company declared bankruptcy in 2018). The loss of those anchor stores put a dent in traffic to indoor malls. According to Placer.ai data, annual indoor mall visits were just about flat in 2019 before collapsing 41.1% in 2020.\n\nThe Covid shutdown was a significant catalyst for Gap to reassess its footprint. Former CEO\u00a0Sonia Syngal announced that the retailer would close 220 of its namesake stores in October 2020 and close 130 Banana Republic stores to right-size its business amid the \u201chyper casualization\u201d trend that contributed to Lululemon\u2019s success.\n\n\"It's no secret five years ago, we were a fleet that was underperforming. I mean, significantly under a lot of pressure, and we executed a fleet rationalization that dated 2020... In 2020, we began that, and it was heavy lifting over the course of those years. We closed over 350 stores,\" said current CEO\u00a0Richard Dickson at a Goldman Sachs retail conference in 2025.\n\nThe company's \u201cPower Plan 2023\" aimed to reposition itself away from Gap stores toward Old Navy and its Lululemon rival brand, Athleta. That plan was yet another reason why its namesake store count fell by about 80% to 472 stores from 2,505 stores worldwide in 2000.\n\n\"We had declining top line. We had brands that were losing share. We had an aging fleet. We had bloated inventory. We had a lot of margin pressure. We had bloated costs. We had low morale. So this was a portfolio of brands that were iconic and recognized. But the performance of our business didn't reflect, if you will, the legacy and the IP value that was inherent in our portfolio,\" said Dickson.\n\nGap gets back to growth\n\nGap's decision to focus on Old Navy has paid off, with Old Navy becoming a leading apparel retailer for parents, kids, and young adults seeking affordable fashion.\n\nThe Old Navy brand includes over 1,300 stores worldwide, including 1,139 in the United States.\n\nRelated: Home Depot CEO sounds alarm on troubling customer trend in stores\n\nOld Navy's customer base means that it has a better-than-average shot at capturing the core key back-to-school spending on clothing, and the company's recent third-quarter financial results show that Old Navy once again delivered the goods for shoppers. Comparable store sales growth at Old Navy stores open at least one year rose 6%.\n\n\"The quarter began with a robust back-to-school season, reinforcing its leadership position in kids and baby in the U.S. denim posted its highest third quarter volume in years with growth across the family. Women's and girls' showed particular strength driven by trend-right styles like barrel, wide leg and baggie fits,\" said Dickson on the earnings call.\n\nDickson called out strength from collaborations with Disney (Jingle Jammies collection) and Anna Sui, which focused on affordable high fashion designs and featured Gen z artist PinkPantheress.\n\nIt wasn't only Old Navy that was strong, though. The company posted positive comparable store sales growth across Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic.\n\nGap namesake comp store sales grew 7%, the 8th consecutive quarter of positive comp store sales growth due partly to its Better in Denim campaign featuring Katseye.\n\n\"Better in Denim culminated in a global cultural takeover and has become one of the brand's most successful campaigns to date, generating significant traffic and double-digit growth in denim,\" said Dickson.\n\nBanana Republic comp sales rose 4%.\n\nAs a result, overall comp store sales were up 5% from the same period last year, marking the fastest comp sales growth in four years. Total revenue rose 3% from one year ago to $3.9 billion.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Gap?\n\nGap's performance shows it has momentum, and its plans to keep customers returning include a significant push for beauty products at Old Navy and CashSoft at Gap.\n\nThe company's one hiccup, however, is Athleta. The brand had capitalized on the athleisure wear trend, elbowing away sales from Lululemon. However, shifting trends away from that style of clothing have dented its growth. Athleta's comp sales fell 11% in the quarter from one year ago.\n\nThe company believes it can continue to drive sales growth, but only time will tell. Apparel is fickle, and rising unemployment could be a headwind to future apparel sales, given that they're discretionary purchases.\n\nRegardless, Gap is on firm financial footing. It generated 62 cents per share in profit, and its cash war chest rose to $2.5 billion exiting the third quarter, despite paying $62 million in shareholder dividends last quarter and buying back $152 million in stock year to date.\n\nRelated: T.J.

These qualities set us apart in a fragmented industry and position us to capture additional market share,\u201d Alber said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWilliams-Sonoma navigating tough tariffs\n\nWilliams-Sonoma continues to face significant tariff challenges due to Section 232 tariffs on furniture, and tariffs of up to 50% on goods from China, India, and Vietnam. Despite these pressures, gross margin expanded 70 basis points to 46.1%.\n\nAlber said higher merchandise margins and supply chain efficiencies helped. The company\u2019s operating expenses increased primarily due to incentive compensation and marketing investments, but were partly offset by operational leverage.\n\n\u201cWilliams-Sonoma delivered a solid third quarter, with consistent comparable sales growth, strong full-price selling, and disciplined cost control that kept operating margins in the high teens,\u201d Telsey Advisory Group Analyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez said in a Benzinga report.\n\n\u201cHowever, the market reaction reflects growing concerns about sharply higher tariff bills, which are expected to squeeze profitability heading into 2026.\u201d\n\nFern\u00e1ndez provided a balanced take on the company\u2019s prospects, reaffirming an outperform rating while lowering the price target slightly to $220 from $225.\n\nRelated: Dollar Tree sees shift in consumer behavior\n\nAlthough tariff expenses were lower than expected in Q3 due to delayed increases, the company anticipates a notable tariff spike in the fourth quarter, with the blended tariff rate rising steeply to 35% from 6% a year ago, according to Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\nSo far, vendor concessions, sourcing shifts, supply-chain efficiencies, and selective price increases have mitigated much of the impact, she said.\n\nStrong cash flow and shareholder returns\n\nWilliams-Sonoma ended the quarter with $885 million in cash. It also generated $316 million in operating cash flow. The company returned $347 million to shareholders through $267 million in share repurchases and $80 million in dividends.\n\nThe board also approved a new $1 billion stock buyback authorization, to begin once the current repurchase authorization is fully utilized.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma has optimistic outlook, despite economic uncertainty\n\nAlber anticipates net revenue growth between 0.5% and 3.5% in the coming year, with comparable brand revenue comps of 2% to 5%. Williams-Sonoma's operating margin guidance was raised to between 17.8% and 18.1%, reflecting expectations for ongoing margin expansion, despite the pressure from tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe continue to gain market share and outperform an industry that declined again in the third quarter,\u201d Alber said. \u201cOur ongoing commitment to innovation, product excellence, and customer service positions us well for future growth.\u201d\n\nBased on the 2025 industry data from IBISWorld and other market research, Williams-Sonoma has a big presence in the home goods sector:\n\nThe TJX Companies Inc.\u00a0\u00a0is the largest home furnishings retailer with approximately 16.2% market share.

Home Depot Inc. dropped more than 5% in the five days, the most since March, after lowering its outlook as strapped homeowners hold off on big-ticket purchases.\n\nEven Walmart Inc., the belle of the retailer ball with huge profits and a rosy forecast, sent an economic warning of sorts. Its shares rallied in the week, but the growth it reported came largely from groceries and mid-tier customers looking for bargains \u2014 both signs of skittishness among consumers.\n\nThis week\u2019s results, which also included reports from Gap Inc., Ross Stores Inc. and TJX Cos., showed that a growing number of consumers are questioning discretionary purchases while trading down for essentials to stretch every dollar. More worryingly, wealthier Americans who have powered the economy for most of the year are becoming cost-conscious. The mood was captured by University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment gauge, which fell to near the lowest on record this month.\n\n\u201cConsumers remain frustrated about the persistence of high prices and weakening incomes,\u201d the report said.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for an economy driven by consumer spending, especially as persistent inflation may keep the Federal Reserve from cutting rates even as the labor market shows signs of weakness.\n\n\u201cAffordability is a major issue during the pivotal holiday stretch that matters most for earnings growth,\u201d said Timothy Chubb, chief investment officer at Girard, a Univest Wealth Division. \u201cI worry that Corporate America\u2019s revenue growth will slow from here and margins will get squeezed as consumer sentiment sours and the economy and labor market soften even further as companies pass on price increases to cash-strapped shoppers.\u201d\n\nRetailer stocks have been trailing the broader market for several years, especially as AI euphoria sent investor dollars pouring into tech and related bets. But the dynamic is worsening in 2025 as lower-end consumers get squeezed by inflation and the job market.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe S&P Retail Select Industry Index \u2014 which includes Macy\u2019s Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Dollar Tree Inc. \u2014 is flat for the year. Target is down 35%, Bath & Body Works Inc. is off 62% and Carmax Inc. has lost 57%. Cut-rate retailers like Dollar Tree Inc. and Dollar General Corp., along with online marketplaces like EBay Inc. and ThredUp Inc. have surged.\n\nInvestors will get more crucial Christmas shopping season forecasts this week as Best Buy Co., Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc. and apparel retailers Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and Urban Outfitters Inc. report results.\n\nStrong profit outlooks would give US stocks a much-needed tailwind into year-end, with the S&P 500 already down 3.5% this month \u2014 heading for its worst November since 2008.\n\nIf Walmart lives up to its bellwether status, investors could be in for a rough ride. While its business is humming - the stock rose 2.8% last week \u2014 the boost came from spending by upper-income households that usually shop at higher end stores.\n\n\u201cWe continue to benefit from higher-income families choosing to shop with us more often,\u201d Doug McMillon, the retailer\u2019s chief executive officer, said. \u201cMiddle-income households have been steady. Lower-income families have been under additional pressure of late.\u201d\n\nA similar dynamic boosted off-price retailers TJX and Ross Stores, which reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and boosted their outlook on the expectation that consumers seeking out value will drive growth this holiday season.\n\nThe last batch of retailer earnings, culminating Dec. 3 with Macy\u2019s Inc., may flash a green light for investors. But sticky inflation is forcing shoppers to pay more for essentials, and that\u2019s left stores stuck with a glut of products, causing retailers to mark down prices at the expense of profits.\n\nAlthough inflation has been cooling, Bloomberg Intelligence says price pressures will remain a key hurdle for the discretionary and staples sectors. That\u2019s why retail executives\u2019 tone on promotions and holiday shopping will be crucial.\n\nA cautious approach is understandable. The bad news reflects how inflation, and growing economic uncertainty are weighing on holiday spending plans. And sales from the fourth quarter, traditionally the strongest time of the year, may not be a savior this time around as more stores and chains warn of frugal shoppers.\n\nThere\u2019s some reason for hope, though. Holiday spending will surpass $1 trillion this year and set a record despite consumer caution, according to a forecast by the National Retail Federation.\n\nThat said, this year\u2019s shopping season is shaping up to be more subdued than last year, with fewer consumers planning to increase holiday spending mostly driven by higher prices, according to data compiled by Michelle Weaver, US thematic and equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIn fact, 38% of consumers plan to keep their holiday budgets the same, 30% expect to spend more while 23% expect to spend less \u2014 resulting in a net increase of 6% spending growth from a year earlier, down significantly from 14% growth in the 2024 period.\n\nWith the holiday sales season here, history says the Thanksgiving week means increased volatility for consumer stocks.\n\n\u201cThe Grinch is not going to steal Christmas for retailers and shoppers, but holiday promotions and discounts will be crucial to spur holiday spending to support earnings growth and stock prices into year-end,\u201d said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPermabull Tom Lee Sees Bitcoin as High as $200,000 by January\u2019s End Weed Drinks That Get You Very, Very High Could Be Gone Soon The Dirty Secret of Biodegradable Plastic Cutting Ties With China Is Harder Than Companies Expected The New Requirement for MBAs Seeking Consulting Jobs: AI Proficiency\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-stocks-unlikely-holiday-miracle-140000985.html", "symbols": ["ANF.US", "BBY.US", "COST.US", "DKS.US", "DLTR.US", "DYH.BE", "DYH.DU", "DYH.F", "DYH.HM", "DYH.MU", "EBAY.US", "GPS.US", "HD.MX", "HD.US", "HDI.BE", "HDI.DU", "HDI.F", "HDI.HM", "HDI.MU", "HDI0.F", "HOME34.SA"], "tags": ["CONSUMER-SENTIMENT", "EARNINGS", "EARNINGS GROWTH", "FOURTH QUARTER", "HOLIDAY-SPENDING", "INFLATION", "RETAIL", "REVENUE GROWTH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.063, "neu": 0.795, "pos": 0.142}}, {"date": "2025-11-22T11:15:00+00:00", "title": "1 Sector ETF to Avoid Like the Plague in November", "content": "Key Points\n\nIn theory, this sector ETF should be providing shelter from the storm, but it's not. Making matters worse, it's betraying usually favorable seasonality. Some of its biggest holdings aren't cheap. They're actually pricier than some tech stocks. 10 stocks we like better than Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund \u203a\n\nAn investor looking at some recent goings on in financial markets, namely the massive paring of market value in the cryptocurrency realm and increased chatter about an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble, might conclude that now is a good time to get defensive.\n\nThere's some merit in that view, but consumer staples -- typically one of the most defensive sectors -- is betraying investors' trust. That alone is ample reason for market participants to approach staples exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with a healthy dose of skepticism and not attempt to catch what may be falling knives before November concludes.\n\nIn fact, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLP) stands out as a sector ETF to avoid this month, and there are multiple reasons why that's the case.This sector ETF should be avoided in November and perhaps beyond. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNovember rain for the XLP ETF\n\nHome to $14.94 billion in assets under management, this consumer staples ETF is one of the oldest and largest funds in the category, but those traits haven't insulated it from recent weakness. For the month ending Nov. 18, the fund retreated 3.6%, bringing its year-to-date loss to 2.7%. It's off 6.4% over the past six months. All those data points justify why there hasn't been a real sector rotation out of growth fare into defensive groups like staples. Those are good reasons to avoid this ETF this month.\n\nBut wait, there's more -- and it's comparably gloomy.\n\nStaples are slumping during a calendar stretch that's often kind to the sector. Over the past 20 years, November has, on average, been the second-best month of the year in which to own consumer-packaged goods stocks, with the sector posting a 70% win frequency in the 11th month of the year.\n\nWith November drawing to a close, this staples ETF needs a miracle to get anywhere close to living up to its previously positive seasonal trends. Said another way, this sector fund has disappointed investors at a time when it should be doing the exact opposite.\n\nA dud sector ETF that's not cheap\n\nIt's not uncommon for consumer staples stocks to trade at multiples above those of the broader market. That's the cost of admission investors pay to access above-average dividend yields and favorable volatility traits, but these days, some big-name staples are looking quite frothy on valuation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor all the talk about tech stocks like Nvidia being too expensive, the real valuation offenders are Costco Wholesale and Walmart. Believe it or not, Costco commands a higher valuation multiple than Nvidia. So does Walmart.\n\nYet neither of those stocks offers the growth prospects of Nvidia. With that duo combining for over 20% of the Consumer Staples SPDR's portfolio, investors betting on this ETF may be left disappointed while paying up for that ominous feeling.\n\nShould you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn\u2019t one of them.

It's innovating with e-commerce, merchandise, and more. The company is a Dividend King. 10 stocks we like better than Walmart \u203a\n\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT) shared some exciting news last week with the announcement of CEO Doug McMillon's retirement. McMillon has shepherded the company for the past decade, bringing its digital channels up to par and protecting the company's economic moat. However, he's moving on, and Walmart veteran John Furner will be taking the reins on Jan. 31, 2026.\n\nThe announcement didn't make many waves because for solid companies that run well, it's just a handover. Investors don't expect any big changes at Walmart, which is going from a longtime veteran CEO, who started at the bottom, to another longtime veteran, who started at the bottom.\n\nThese executives know the company inside out, and Furner isn't likely to make any unusual moves. However, there's always innovation happening at Walmart, which is how it keeps its top spot. It's also one of three reasons to buy Walmart stock today.Image source: Walmart.\n\n1. It's still the largest company in the world\n\nDespite constant competition from companies like Amazon, Walmart is still the largest company in the world by sales. While size doesn't guarantee longevity or greatness, it indicates a company that's doing things right. Walmart is so big that it would be difficult for any competitor to knock it down. It's also been holding up well in the face of challengers, demonstrating consistent growth and keeping its lead.\n\nThe company has 4,700 stores in the U.S alone, well ahead of any other retailer, and more than 10,000 stores worldwide. While the U.S. is its core business, it's well-diversified globally. In the U.S., it also has Sam's Club, which has a warehouse membership model and competes with Costco Wholesale.\n\nIt does look like Amazon is going to take the lead, and that's likely to happen next year. But Walmart will remain the largest physical retailer even when that does happen, and its e-commerce business is giving Amazon a run for its money.\n\n2. The more things change, the more they stay the same\n\nWalmart was late to the e-commerce game, allowing Amazon to move retail into e-commerce quickly. However, it got itself together and now has a formidable e-commerce business.\n\nE-commerce has been its biggest growth driver over the past few quarters, and Walmart has tailored it to its strengths. For example, it has a huge network of U.S. stores that can act as delivery hubs and quickly fulfill orders. They're also close enough to most U.S. households to make it easy to pick orders up faster than even Amazon can get them to customers' doors, as 90% of Americans live within a 10-mile radius of a Walmart store. E-commerce sales increased 25% year over year in the 2026 fiscal third quarter (ended July 31), with a 26% increase in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is innovating in other ways, too. It's bringing new lines of products to appeal to different populations and broaden its target clientele and has launched a range of healthcare services at some stores. Last year, it bought streaming company Vizio to expand its advertising business.\n\nThese are necessary actions to stay relevant and dominant in a changing world.\n\n3. It's a Dividend King\n\nWalmart is a Dividend King and has raised its dividend for the past 52 years straight. That's through all kinds of ups and downs, including a global pandemic and inflation, and demonstrates complete commitment to creating shareholder value. That's an important feature in a reliable stock.\n\nWalmart doesn't pay a high-yielding dividend -- yielding only 0.9% at the current price. But shareholders can count on it through thick and thin, making it an excellent stock to own in any climate, especially when the market is volatile.\n\nShould you buy stock in Walmart right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walmart wasn\u2019t one of them.

Additionally, Walmart raised its guidance for full-year operating income by nearly 400 basis points to a growth range of 8.5%-9.5%.\n\nAs for Target, the retailer cut the top end of its full-year profit outlook, guiding its current FY26 EPS at $7.00-$8.00 from previous expectations of $7.00-$9.00.

Speaking at an event, Williams stated that he sees \u201croom for a further adjustment\u201d for interest rates, which immediately shifted market expectations. Following his remarks, the perceived likelihood of an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's December meeting flipped from unlikely to more likely than not. The prospect of lower borrowing costs sent a wave of optimism through the markets, leading to a rally in major indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $13.32, up 3.2% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Arlo Technologies?

Here's what happened", "content": "Richard Marquette spent decades tending his bees \u2014 tiny workers that kept his Citrus County property buzzing and his bank account afloat. But when the 84-year-old beekeeper stopped by his vacant lot in late July, something felt off. His main source of income had simply bee-lined out of there.\n\nMust Read\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake \u2014 here\u2019s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nTwenty hives \u2014 about two million bees and anywhere from $8,000 to $16,000 in honey per harvest \u2014 vanished. Every box had Marquette\u2019s initials, his state registration number and the honey he was counting on to get by while he\u2019s on medical leave from his Walmart job sealed inside.\n\nInstead of bees, Marquette found contractors cutting down trees nearly 50 feet inside his property line. When he asked what happened to the hives, he was told they\u2019d been \u201cmoved\u201d by someone claiming to own the land.\n\n\"How can somebody come on my property and take my bees and not return them and not be sorry?\" Marquette told Tampa Bay 28 (1).\n\nWhere did the bees go?\n\nWhen the Citrus County Sheriff\u2019s Office stepped in, deputies traced the missing hives to Joseph Denick, the man who purchased the lot next to Marquette\u2019s. According to the incident report, a land-clearing crew mistakenly crossed onto Marquette\u2019s side of the property line and Denick admitted he told a friend to remove the hives.\n\nHe also told deputies he was willing to return them. But more than 90 days later, the bees still haven\u2019t come back. Beekeeping experts estimate that each hive can generate $200 to $500 a year, depending on where the hives are located, how they\u2019re managed and local demand for honey and bee products.\n\n\"The sheriff's department's closed the case and I'm out my money and my work and the honey crop and future honey crops,\" Marquette said.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Denick acknowledged posting on Facebook offering the hives to anyone willing to pick them up. He said a \u201cfriend of a friend\u201d ultimately took them though he wouldn\u2019t say who. He declined an on-camera interview from Tampa Bay 28 and says he planned to address the issue through the courts.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett used 8 simple money rules to turn $9,800 into a stunning $150B \u2014 start using them today to get rich (and then stay rich)\n\nA livelihood lost\n\nMarquette has kept bees since he was 10 years old long before side hustles became the financial lifeline they are today. And he leans on his hives the same way millions of Americans do: to close the gap when life doesn\u2019t quite add up.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA 2025 PYMNTS Intelligence report found that 41% of U.S. consumers earn supplemental income, a number that jumps to about 50% for people living paycheck to paycheck (2). So when his operation vanished, it wasn\u2019t just inconvenient. It was destabilizing. With honey selling for $20 a quart and a single hive producing up to 40 quarts a season, losing his bees meant losing a crucial stream of income he can\u2019t easily replace.\n\n\"I can't figure out why they won't bring them back or at least pay me for the bees or whatever, but I haven't been able to get anything,\" Marquette said.\n\nFor anyone who relies on their property or the equipment on it to earn supplemental income, experts say the first steps matter: document everything, confirm your property boundaries and report unauthorized work as soon as you notice it. If the loss affects your ability to earn, consulting an attorney can help you pursue compensation that goes beyond replacing physical items.\n\nMarquette is already taking that route. Attorney Andy Lyons sent Denick a letter giving him seven days to respond, arguing the damage isn\u2019t limited to lost honey sales.\n\n\"His ability to earn a living for an entire year or more has been destroyed by this, and of course the damage to the bees themselves, the queens that were in the hives, the whole ecosystem that surrounds them was wiped out in a day,\" Lyons said.\n\nMarquette lost up to two million bees, a blow with environmental consequences, too. Honeybees help pollinate roughly a third of the food crops we rely on, yet they\u2019re consistently threatened by mites, disease and pesticides.\n\nIf Denick doesn\u2019t cooperate, Marquette plans to take further legal action to recover the hives and equipment.\n\nAs for the honey he can no longer harvest: \u201cSame thing as gold,\u201d Marquette said. \u201cEspecially when you need it.\u201d\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nI\u2019m almost 50 and have nothing saved for retirement \u2014 what now?

It was up 27% to almost to the point where they mentioned on the earnings call, they're now attracting even more affluent customers. So, they're not only just growing in traffic, they're growing wallet share from more of the the the wealthier consumers that they want to interact with. and that's them using online sales to compete directly with Amazon, home delivery, making it easier to interact, and they're really doing a great job with that e-commerce division.\n\n00:46 Speaker A\n\nAs they attract those more affluent customers, Brian, I'm curious what do you think the the impact is on the financials long-term? You know, what could it what could it mean for for revenue mix, for competitive positioning?\n\n01:05 Brian\n\nIt adds a lot of sustainability to to revenue growth because these more affluent consumers aren't just buying groceries or generic diapers and things of that nature. They'll get into the more of the apparel and the hard goods and they like to act in in that manner with their wallet. And so that leads to not just revenue growth, but a sustainable form of revenue growth in higher margin items and products, and that's really what's exciting about the near-term growth for Walmart going forward.\n\n01:40 Speaker A\n\nYou like the new CEO, Brian, John Furner, right guy for the job?\n\n01:44 Brian\n\nYeah, insider, he's he knows all the culture.

There, Walmart is optimistic too.\n\n\"Holiday is off to a pretty good start,\" Rainey said on the company's earnings call. \"Back-to-school tends to be an early indicator for how that goes, Halloween, likewise for Thanksgiving, and everything that we've seen so far makes us optimistic and encouraged about customers and members leaning into the seasonal events and holiday shopping period.\" Thu, November 20, 2025 at 12:41 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWalmart earnings surpass estimates as retailer lifts guidance\n\nYahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports:\n\nRead more here.

That could trigger a $320 billion swing in the chipmaker's market value, which would mark its largest move in post-earnings. At last check, Nvidia's market cap stood around $4.42 trillion.\n\nWith so many AI stocks tied to Nvidia's fortunes, a significant swing in either direction could have wide-reaching impacts in markets.\n\n\"It's a macro indicator at this point,\" Empower chief investment strategist Marta Norton said to Yahoo Finance about Nvidia earnings. With expectations running high, Norton was skeptical about Nvidia's ability to pull out an upside surprise.\n\n\"The concern is, even if they do blow it out, that investors are still going to be skittish, just because that's the sentiment in the markets today,\" Norton said. \"So I think it is very critical.

They told us the consumer wasn\u2019t collapsing, but they also weren\u2019t opening their wallets like they used to. Big home projects were getting delayed. DIY was soft. And inventory levels were steady enough that a big January restock wasn\u2019t coming.\n\nNow Lowe\u2019s and Walmart have stepped up to the mic \u2014 and they\u2019ve basically confirmed everything Home Depot hinted at. And for small carriers who live and die by freight cycles instead of corporate projections, this second round of earnings offers something even more important: clarity.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through what these two retail giants really told us.\n\nLowe\u2019s \u2014 The Project Economy Is Moving, But Slowly\n\nLowe\u2019s numbers differed from Home Depot in a way that\u2019s almost impossible to ignore. Sales were steady, but not strong. Customers are still buying the basics, but they\u2019re holding off on big remodels, upgrades, or unnecessary home improvement plans.\n\nWhat stood out most was Lowe\u2019s comment about their Pro customer base \u2014 the contractors and builders who typically drive the bulk of construction-related freight. They\u2019re still coming in, still spending, still working. But they\u2019re not scaling. They\u2019re not taking on bigger jobs. They\u2019re not pulling the trigger on the kind of materials orders that push big volumes through flatbed, LTL, and regional van networks.\n\nThat\u2019s a meaningful signal.\n\nThe construction world is usually a leading indicator for freight three to four months down the road. When contractors are confident, they buy early and stock up. When they\u2019re unsure, they buy only what the job requires \u2014 nothing more. And right now, Lowe\u2019s is telling us they\u2019re in the second camp.\n\nFor truckers, that likely means a slower January and February for materials, appliances, fixtures, and other home-related freight. There will still be freight \u2014 it just won\u2019t be the heavy-volume kind that kicks off an early spring surge. Flatbeds rely heavily on the building material segment that both Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot rely on. Pro penetration (the total percentage of retail sales from the pro customer) is the bread and butter of these two retail giants.Balanced inventory levels across retailers suggest limited early-year restocking, which typically keeps truckload demand flat heading into Q1. (Source: SONAR. TRIS.USA)\n\nWalmart \u2014 The Consumer Is Stable, But Far More Disciplined\n\nIf Home Depot shows one slice of American spending and Lowe\u2019s shows another, Walmart reveals the whole heartbeat. And Walmart\u2019s Q3 earnings tell a complicated but honest story: the consumer is still spending, but spending with caution.\n\nGrocery was strong. Everyday essentials were strong. E-commerce showed healthy growth. But the discretionary categories \u2014 the TVs, electronics, decor, general merchandise \u2014 are soft. Not dead. Just soft enough that Walmart isn\u2019t ordering aggressively.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnd when Walmart isn\u2019t ordering aggressively, DCs across the country shift into \u201cdefensive mode.\u201d They keep stock tight. They replenish only when they need to, especially in the final stretch. They avoid big forward-positioning pushes.\n\nThat discipline potentially affects the entire trucking ecosystem:\n\nfewer replenishment runs leaving import DCs  fewer high-margin consumer loads  fewer regional surges tied to general merchandise  less long-haul van freight being pushed ahead of Q1\n\nWhat Walmart actually revealed is that the consumer hasn\u2019t stopped \u2014 they\u2019ve just changed how they spend. More groceries. More necessities. More value-based shopping. Less impulse buying. Less big-ticket activity.\n\nAnd that creates a freight environment that moves, but doesn\u2019t accelerate.\n\nWhat This Really Means for Q1\n\nPut all three together \u2014 Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, and Walmart \u2014 and a clear picture emerges of what small carriers can expect heading into the first quarter of 2026.\n\nJanuary is almost setup to be slow. This isn\u2019t a year where large retailers overshot their inventory and now need to refill everything at once. If anything, they\u2019ve kept inventory lean on purpose. That means less panic-buying, less urgent replenishment, and fewer \u201cpushes\u201d of freight into distribution centers early in the year. We have seen this in the slowing of inbound container volume as well.\n\nThe consumer is stable \u2014 not booming, not collapsing \u2014 which creates a freight market that\u2019s steady but tight. Rates don\u2019t crash in an environment like this, but they also don\u2019t climb. The freight isn\u2019t drying up; it\u2019s just not expanding in a way that moves spot rates. When you throw in added capacity, you experience rate stagnation.\n\nWinter will be carried mostly by essentials: food, supplies, household goods, consumables, the kind of freight that never truly goes away. This will keep trucks rolling, but not at aggressive rates.\n\nConstruction-related freight looks slow until at least March. The Pros aren\u2019t scaling, and Lowe\u2019s made that clear. Without those early-material orders, the spring build-up could hit later than normal.\n\nE-commerce will help keep freight flowing, especially into the Southeast and major metro areas, but it won\u2019t save the quarter. So much of that freight is already locked under contract with mega carriers \u2014 they\u2019ll eat first, as always.\n\nAnd DCs being cautious creates a predictable effect: no spikes, fewer swings, and tighter spot availability.\n\nThe Real Story Small Carriers Should Pay Attention To\n\nThe real story isn\u2019t the earnings numbers. It\u2019s the behavior underlying those numbers. Retailers are acting intentionally conservative right now:\n\nThey\u2019re ordering strategically.  They\u2019re protecting margins.  They\u2019re avoiding overstocking, which they learned from the pandemic.  They\u2019re leaning harder on forecasting models.  They\u2019re only replenishing when the customer forces their hand.\n\nIn trucking, volatility creates opportunity. When inventories run too low, freight surges. When inventories run too high, freight surges again as retailers scramble to reposition. But in a balanced environment \u2014 the kind these retailers are carefully maintaining \u2014 volatility disappears.\n\nAnd without volatility, the spot market stays quiet.\n\nWhat Carriers Should Watch Between Now and February\n\nThe next eight to twelve weeks matter. They\u2019ll decide how spring looks. Carriers should watch:\n\nWhether Walmart increases grocery purchase orders after holiday demand  Whether Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot place early spring orders for materials  Whether import volumes begin climbing into West Coast ports  Whether consumer sentiment in January ticks up or down  Whether DCs start hiring seasonal warehouse crews early\n\nThese things matter more than capacity exits, more than short-term rate bumps, and more than the social media predictions that pop up every week.\n\nRetail tells the truth first. Trucking feels the truth later.\n\nRight now, retail is telling us to expect a slow climb into spring.\n\nFinal Thought \u2014 This Is a Quarter to Be Smart, Not Overly Optimistic\n\nThis winter will reward small carriers who manage their cost per mile, keep their lanes tight, and secure relationships with brokers they trust. It\u2019s not a time to gamble on the spot market. It\u2019s a time to run smart miles and protect the business until stronger demand cycles return.\n\nQ1 won\u2019t deliver a miracle. But it also won\u2019t deliver a collapse. What we\u2019re entering is a season of steady freight with firm floors and low ceilings \u2014 and the carriers who adapt to that reality will be the ones standing strong when demand finally broadens later in the year.\n\nThe post What Lowe\u2019s and Walmart Just Told Us About Q1 Freight \u2014 Part 2 of the Retail Freight Outlook appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowe-walmart-just-told-us-190235067.html", "symbols": ["HD.MX", "HD.US", "HDI.BE", "HDI.DU", "HDI.F", "HDI.HM", "HDI.MU", "HDI0.F", "HOME34.SA", "LOW.US", "LOWC34.SA", "LWE.BE", "LWE.DU", "LWE.F", "LWE.MU", "WALM34.SA", "WMT.BA", "WMT.BE", "WMT.F", "WMT.HM", "WMT.MU", "WMT.MX", "WMT.US"], "tags": ["CONSUMER-SPENDING", "EARNINGS", "FREIGHT", "RETAIL", "SUPPLY-CHAIN"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.844, "pos": 0.106}}, {"date": "2025-11-21T18:49:18+00:00", "title": "Kroger announces unexpected closures\u00a0ahead of holiday season", "content": "While Kroger has long been a trusted grocery destination for millions of consumers since its founding in 1883, the way people shop has undergone drastic changes since the pandemic. Many shoppers now prefer the convenience of placing orders online instead of visiting stores in person.\n\nThat shift is bringing significant changes to Kroger's business. Several of its markets are about to lose a key delivery service, and in one state, it will disappear entirely.\n\nThe rise in popularity of\u00a0online shopping\u00a0continues to reshape consumer habits and the retail industry.\u00a0With the ability to fill a virtual cart and schedule a convenient pickup or delivery time, some shoppers see little need to step inside a store.\n\nAccording to Capital One Shopping, U.S. online\u00a0grocery\u00a0sales increased 104% during the pandemic and are projected to grow 12.3% annually through 2029.\u00a0In 2025, more than 148 million Americans, nearly 52% of the population, are expected to buy groceries online.\n\nKroger to close five fulfillment facilities\n\nKroger (KR) confirmed on its website that it will close five fulfillment facilities in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin; Frederick, Maryland; Groveland,\u00a0Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in January 2026, in an effort to streamline operations and improve delivery efficiency.\n\nIn Florida, the Groveland shutdown will be accompanied by the closure of three additional connected fulfillment centers in Rockledge, Tampa, and Jacksonville, according to WARN filings.\n\nKroger facility layoffs\n\nPleasant Prairie Facility: 211 jobs\r\n Source: DWD Groveland Facility: 935 jobs\r\n Source: Florida Commerce Rockledge Facility: 53 jobs Tampa Facility: 234 jobs Jacksonville Facility: 181 jobs Frederick Facility: No information as of November 21\r\n Source: Maryland Department of Labor Nashville Facility: No information as of November 21\r\n Source: TN Oklahoma City Facility: No information as of November 21\r\n Source: The OklahomanKroger will close five fulfillment centers by 2026, ending its delivery service across several markets.Shutterstock\n\nWhy Kroger is closing fulfillment centers\n\nKroger expects the restructuring to contribute to a $400 million increase in e-commerce operating profit by 2026, which will allow it to reinvest in lower prices, improved store conditions, and stronger margins.\n\nHowever, the company anticipates about $2.6 billion in impairment charges in the third fiscal quarter of 2025 due to the closures and the underperformance of its automated fulfillment network. Despite this financial hit, Kroger says comparable sales should remain neutral to any impact.\n\nMore Closures:\n\n100-year-old grocery chain\u2019s stores acquired by rival after closures 98-year-old beer store chain has closed nearly 100 locations so far 61-year-old fast-food chain quietly closes dozens of locations nationwide\n\n\"We are building on a strong foundation with five consecutive quarters of double-digit eCommerce sales growth and increased profitability improvements,\" said Kroger CEO Ron Sargent in the news release. \"We are taking decisive action to make shopping easier, offer faster delivery times, provide more options to our customers, and we expect to deliver profitable sales growth.\"\n\nWhat the Kroger facility closures mean for customers\n\nKroger operates 1,238 grocery stores across 16 states, but hasn't had physical locations in Florida since the late 1980s. To fill this gap, the company provided its delivery service in the state through its Florida-based fulfillment centers.\n\nWith these Florida facilities closing, the state will lose access to Kroger's entire grocery delivery program. Customers in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Nashville, Tennessee; Chicago, Illinois; and Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin will only lose local access in those markets.\n\nAccording to Fox35 Orlando, Florida customers were notified via email that final orders must be placed by January 31, with delivery ending on February 1. Kroger's website states that starting January 7, all remaining delivery options will come directly from its stores instead of automated centers.\n\nMore Kroger cuts ahead\n\nFulfillment centers aren't the only part of Kroger's business being cut. In its first-quarter earnings report for fiscal 2025, the company revealed plans to shutter 60 underperforming stores by the end of 2026.\n\nKroger has also made several rounds of layoffs this year, with the recent fulfillment center closures marking at least the fourth round of job cuts in 2025.\n\nKroger's recent layoffs\n\nFebruary: Eliminated 200 positions across three Cincinnati office sites\r\n Source: Cincinnati Business Courier March: Laid off employees at 84.51\u00b0, Kroger's retail data science and analytics subsidiary\r\n Source: The Cincinnati Enquirer August: Cut around 1,000 corporate jobs, primarily impacting its Technology and Digital division\r\n Source: The Street\n\nGrocery delivery evolves\n\nTo better adapt to evolving consumer habits, Kroger is relying on its third-party partners to deliver groceries across more markets and fuel its retail media business.\n\nThe company expanded its partnership with Instacart, which will become its primary delivery fulfillment provider, and Kroger will be among the first retailers to integrate Instacart's AI tool, Cart Assistant, into its app. The retailer has also broadened its relationship with DoorDash and Uber Eats.\n\n\"Our differentiated approach, combining the proximity of our stores with high-capacity automation, the wide assortment of the fresh food they love, allows us to fulfill more trips for the families we serve,\" said Kroger Executive VP and Chief Digital Officer Yael Cosset.\n\nKroger will continue to use automated customer fulfillment where demand is high and will pilot store-based fulfillment in high-volume markets to improve its fulfillment capabilities and enhance the in-store experience.\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2025, total sales increased 0.08%, with same-store sales up 3.4%. This growth was partly driven by a 16% rise in e-commerce sales.\n\n\"Shifts in consumer preferences present an opportune moment for both shippers and providers to reassess their approaches,\" said McKinsey & Company.\n\n\"Decisions regarding cost, speed, reliability, transparency, flexibility, and sustainability can all be reevaluated.

If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is poised to surpass Walmart (NYSE:WMT) as the world's largest company by annual revenue this year. With trailing 12-month figures showing the two currently running neck-and-neck, Amazon's faster trajectory now has analysts believing it will pull ahead in calendar 2025 comparisons.\n\nThis milestone marks a shift from traditional retail dominance to a tech-driven giant, where e-commerce, logistics, advertising, and especially cloud computing fuel expansion. While Walmart continues aggressive growth in omnichannel retail and could reclaim the revenue crown in coming quarters through grocery strength and international expansion, Amazon's diversified model delivers higher compound growth rates -- over 20% CAGR in recent years versus Walmart's low single digits.\n\nThe real differentiator, however, lies in one overlooked signal from the capital markets that points to Amazon's AI dominance for the 2030s.\n\nThe Bond Market's Massive Vote of Confidence\n\nAmazon recently issued $15 billion in debt, including a rare 40-year bond, and saw demand approach $80 billion -- more than five times oversubscribed. Investors accepted yields only about 80 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasuries, effectively treating Amazon as quasi-sovereign credit despite the long maturity. This level of demand is extraordinary for a private company raising funds for aggressive capital expenditures.\n\nThe proceeds will primarily support a multi-year AI infrastructure buildout: data centers, custom silicon like Trainium chips, and expanded GPU clusters through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Bond buyers are signaling that they trust Amazon to invest tens of billions annually in AI without eroding returns -- a level of confidence not extended to most corporations attempting similar scale.\n\nWhy Cheap, Long-Term Capital Creates an Unbreakable AI Moat\n\nThis financing advantage highlights two structural shifts in AI infrastructure. First, capital is flowing disproportionately to companies with proven scale, predictable cash flows from existing businesses, and clear paths to monetize AI. Amazon checks every box: AWS already approaching a $130 billion annual revenue run rate, e-commerce throws off steady free cash flow, and advertising margins exceed 50%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSecond, the credit market is splitting. Hyperscalers like Amazon borrow at near-government rates, while smaller cloud providers or startups face sharply higher costs -- typically significantly higher, though the exact spread varies depending on market conditions. Over a decade-long AI build cycle, that spread compounds into hundreds of billions in saved interest expense, letting Amazon outspend rivals on capacity without diluting shareholders as aggressively.\n\nWhat This Means for Amazon's AI Leadership\n\nAWS holds roughly 29% global cloud market share and remains the default home for enterprise workloads. Companies training or running large models want their AI close to existing data and applications, most of which already live in AWS. Custom chips like Trainium2 are seeing triple-digit sequential growth and multibillion-dollar run rates, offering better price-performance than third-party alternatives for many workloads.\n\nThe result: accelerating AWS growth (20% year-over-year most recently, and the fastest since 2022) and a backlog of multi-year AI commitments that management says will drive sustained re-acceleration through 2026 and beyond. Retail and advertising provide margin stability while AWS capital expenditures peak within the next year. After that, free cash flow is expected to surge as the new capacity is utilized.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention\n\nIn AI, infrastructure scale often determines winners. The bond market just handed Amazon the cheapest fuel imaginable for a decade-long race most competitors can't afford to run at the same pace. While Walmart battles on price and physical footprint, Amazon is building the picks-and-shovels layer that every other AI player -- startups, enterprises, even competitors -- will rent.\n\nThat combination of capital efficiency, incumbent data gravity, and execution credibility makes Amazon the clearest bet to dominate the economics of artificial intelligence through the 2030s.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

What started as a $5.7 billion offer has swelled past $200 billion in the latest settlement proposal, a bid meant to end the fight over the fees merchants pay every time a customer swipes a card. But instead of smoothing tensions, the new deal has stirred fresh resistance from retailers and politicians, raising the possibility that premium card acceptance could be squeezed if the pact moves forward.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN. Is V fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nWalmart has already signaled that it will likely challenge the settlement, pointing back to the concerns that helped sink a previous $30 billion version last year. The National Retail Federation says the card networks just don't get it or just don't care, warning that the agreement could reshape the industry in ways that may be difficult to unwind. Restaurant groups are pushing back too, arguing that thin margins and limited bargaining power leave them particularly exposed in a system they describe as dominated by two players. Merchant coalitions continue to argue that the latest terms may not offer enough relief to the businesses footing the bill.\n\nPolitical pressure is building alongside the retail backlash. Senator Dick Durbin, a longtime critic of swipe fees and a force behind earlier debit-fee caps, said the new settlement could still fall short for both merchants and consumers at a time when household budgets remain under strain. Now the spotlight shifts to US District Court Judge Brian Cogan, who took over the case in September and is not expected to offer signals before the Dec. 12 objection deadline. Analysts note that this deal involves a mandatory class with no opt-outs, meaning any major retailer grievances could be decisive as one of the longest-running battles in payments enters another uncertain chapter.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/200-billion-swipe-fee-showdown-181809268.html", "symbols": ["3V6.F", "3V64.F", "AMZN.US", "M4I.BE", "M4I.DU", "M4I.F", "M4I.HA", "M4I.HM", "M4I.MU", "M4I0.F", "MA.MX", "MA.US", "MSCD34.SA", "V.MX", "V.US", "VISA34.SA", "WALM34.SA", "WMT.BA", "WMT.BE", "WMT.F"], "tags": ["LEGAL-BATTLE", "PAYMENTS", "RETAIL", "SETTLEMENT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.966, "neg": 0.132, "neu": 0.807, "pos": 0.06}}, {"date": "2025-11-21T17:41:55+00:00", "title": "Stock Market Tumbles On Nvidia, Bitcoin; Walmart, Google Strong: Weekly Review", "content": "The stock market broke below key levels as an Nvidia earnings bounce flopped, despite Friday's bounce.

(NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, today announced the successful closing of the previously announced offering of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% convertible notes due 2033, including the full exercise of the initial purchasers\u2019 option to purchase an additional $56.25 million aggregate principal amount of the notes, resulting in a total aggregate principal amount of $431.25 million. Plug received total net proceeds from the offering of approximately $399.4 million, after deducting the initial purchasers\u2019 discount and estimated offering expenses.\n\nThe proceeds allow Plug to retire all remaining high-cost 15% debt, refinance its 2026 convertible notes, and eliminate the first lien previously held by its former debt provider. These actions significantly reduce interest expense, simplify Plug\u2019s capital structure, and enhance financial flexibility.\n\nImportantly, the refinancing also extends Plug\u2019s lower cost of capital through an eight-year tenor balloon note, providing stable, long-duration financing with no required amortization over that period. This structure preserves liquidity and eliminates near-term principal repayment pressure.\n\nTogether with Plug\u2019s recently announced data center infrastructure agreement, the company now has a fully funded business plan based on its current operating expectations.\n\n\u201cThis financing marks a major turning point for Plug,\u201d said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power. \u201cWith $399 million in new cash, the removal of the first lien, and reduced interest costs, Plug now has one of the strongest balance sheets in years. Extending our lower cost of capital over an eight-year tenor further enhances our flexibility. We are well positioned to support sales growth in both material handling and electrolyzers as customer demand accelerates.\u201d\n\nPlug already has the manufacturing capacity required to meet its growth trajectory. The strengthened balance sheet provides the stability and flexibility needed to support commercial momentum across material handling fleets, distribution centers, and utility-scale electrolyzer deployments.\n\nAbout Plug Power\r\nPlug is building the global hydrogen economy with a fully integrated ecosystem spanning production, storage, delivery, and power generation. A first mover in the industry, Plug provides electrolyzers, liquid hydrogen, fuel cell systems, storage tanks, and fueling infrastructure to industries such as material handling, industrial applications, and energy producers\u2014advancing energy independence and decarbonization at scale.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith electrolyzers deployed across five continents, Plug leads in hydrogen production, delivering large-scale projects that redefine industrial power. The company has deployed over 72,000 fuel cell systems and 275 fueling stations and is the largest user of liquid hydrogen. Plug is rapidly expanding its generation network to ensure reliable, domestically produced supply, with hydrogen plants currently operational in Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana, capable of producing 40 tons per day.\n\nWith employees and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities across the globe, Plug powers global leaders like Walmart, Amazon, Home Depot, BMW, and BP.\n\nFor more information, visit www.plugpower.com.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

With fresh numbers in hand, the key question now is whether the stock\u2019s investment case has strengthened or weakened.\n\nSneak Peek Into Target\u2019s Q3 Performance\n\nShares of Target have slipped 5.5% since it released fiscal third-quarter results on Nov. 19, underscoring investor caution following the top-line miss. Both revenues and earnings declined from the prior-year period, while comparable sales also fell, reflecting sustained pressure across discretionary categories. Further weighing on sentiment, management narrowed its full-year profit outlook. (Read: Target Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Sales Decline Amid Soft Traffic)\r\n\r\nDespite the challenging environment, Target continued to show resilience in digital growth and non-merchandise revenue streams, aided by strength in membership, marketplace and Roundel advertising.\r\n\r\nThe company reaffirmed confidence in its holiday readiness. Strong execution of fulfillment options, expanded exclusive assortments and continued efficiency gains remain core to Target\u2019s multiyear transformation plan. Management reiterated its focus on strengthening merchandising authority, elevating the guest experience and accelerating technology-driven operational enhancements.\n\nTarget Stock Lags Significantly Despite Broader Market Rally\n\nTarget has experienced a steep decline over the past three months, with its shares tumbling 15.7%, underperforming the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry's decline of 3.7%. The company also trailed the Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s decline of 5.2% and the S&P 500's rise of 3.9% during the same period.\n\nTGT\u2019s Past 3 Months\u2019 PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nClosing at $83.68 yesterday, TGT stock stands 42.3% below its 52-week high of $145.08 reached on Jan. 28, 2025. Target is trading below its 50 and 200-day simple moving averages of $89.18 and $97.41, respectively, signaling bearish sentiment in maintaining the recent performance levels.\n\nTGT Trades Below 50 & 200-Day Moving Averages Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTarget\u2019s share decline reflects continued sales softness, discretionary-category weakness and margin pressure. Volatile demand trends and a longer turnaround timeline have further weighed on sentiment.\r\n\r\nTarget has also underperformed its peers, including Walmart Inc. WMT, Ross Stores Inc. ROST and Costco Wholesale Corporation COST. \r\n\r\nShares of Walmart and Ross Stores have increased 10.6% and 9%, respectively, whereas shares of Costco have lost 6.8% over the same period.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTGT vs. Peer Performances Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe recent slide in the stock has contributed to its discounted status. TGT stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.59, lower than the industry\u2019s average of 29.10. Peers \u2014 Walmart, Ross Stores and Costco \u2014 are trading at higher forward P/E ratios of 37.44, 23.84 and 43.85, respectively, compared with Target.\n\nTGT P/E Ratio (Forward 12 Months)Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat\u2019s Behind TGT\u2019s Dismal Stock Run?\n\nTarget continues to struggle in regaining momentum amid a challenging retail backdrop. Fiscal third-quarter results were in line with internal expectations but still reflected contraction, with comparable sales declining 2.7% year over year. Weakness remained concentrated in discretionary categories such as Home and Apparel. Also, store comps fell roughly 3.8% during the quarter. \r\n\r\nMoreover, margins faced pressure. The gross margin rate slipped 10 basis points from last year, weighed down by higher markdowns, though partially offset by improved inventory shrink and supply-chain productivity. SG&A deleveraged around 60 basis points, caused in part by one-time business transformation costs. Adjusted EPS fell to $1.78, down from $1.85 a year earlier. \r\n\r\nConsumer sentiment has dropped and shoppers continue to prioritize value and essentials over discretionary goods. Traffic, or the number of transactions, dipped 2.2%, while the average transaction amount slid 0.5% in the fiscal third quarter. \r\n\r\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Target projects a low-single-digit decline in sales. Full-year adjusted EPS guidance has been narrowed to $7.00-$8.00 compared with the prior estimate of $7.00-$9.00, reflecting cautiousness around demand volatility and external uncertainty. While leadership expresses confidence in the long-term strategy, near-term momentum remains challenged.\n\nDownward Estimate for TGT Post Q3 Earnings\n\nReflecting cautious sentiment around Target, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS has seen downward revisions. Over the past seven days, the consensus estimates for the current and next fiscal years have declined 5 cents to $7.32 and 3 cents to $8.00 per share, respectively.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTarget\u2019s Game Plan to Overcome Current Challenges\n\nTarget is gaining momentum across the digital and innovation initiatives, helping reinforce its competitive position despite a challenging retail environment. Digital comparable sales grew 2.4% in the fiscal third quarter, supported by more than 35% growth in same-day delivery through Target Circle 360. Marketplace and media businesses also accelerated, with Target Plus GMV rising nearly 50% and Roundel delivering mid-teens growth, highlighting the strength of TGT\u2019s profitable digital ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThe company is expanding its leadership in AI-driven retail with a first-of-its-kind conversational shopping experience inside ChatGPT. The new integration enables curated browsing, multi-item checkout, fresh-food shopping and Drive Up, Pickup or shipping \u2014 all within a single session. Guests will receive personalized recommendations while shopping Target\u2019s full assortment. This advancement reflects Target\u2019s strategy to meet consumers wherever they are with greater convenience, curation and value.\r\n\r\nOperational and technology upgrades are delivering strong results, with advanced machine-learning systems and new Gen-AI tools improving forecasting, assortment planning and speed to market. Tools like the Target Trend Brain and synthetic audiences have strengthened decision-making and responsiveness. These advancements drove a 150-basis-point improvement in on-shelf availability \u2014 Target\u2019s strongest gain in years \u2014 and improved inventory flow across the network.\r\n\r\nMomentum is also building in merchandising. Fun 101, Target\u2019s transformed Hardlines strategy, delivered strong growth across toys, games, entertainment and sporting equipment, while Food & Beverage continued comp growth driven by beverages, candy and trend-right wellness products. Newness resonated with guests in categories such as denim, sleepwear and seasonal assortments \u2014 reinforcing the effectiveness of design-led merchandising. \r\n\r\nFinally, Target is investing aggressively in long-term growth. CapEx is set to increase approximately $1 billion next year \u2014 from $4 billion in fiscal 2025 to about $5 billion in fiscal 2026 \u2014 representing a 25% year-over-year rise. These incremental dollars will fund more store remodels, expanded fulfillment capabilities, new larger-format stores and the most significant floor pad transformations in a decade. Early performance from remodeled and new stores continues to exceed expectations, validating this elevated investment.\n\nHow to Play TGT Stock: Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nWhile Target\u2019s weak traffic, pressured margins and soft discretionary demand create near-term uncertainty, early progress in digital growth, merchandising and operational efficiency suggests the foundation for recovery is forming. Still, caution is appropriate given ongoing volatility.\r\n\r\nTarget\u2019s turnaround is developing but not yet secure. Higher-risk investors may consider limited exposure at today\u2019s discounted valuation, while conservative investors should wait for clearer signs of sustained sales and margin improvement.\r\n\r\nAt present, TGT carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
