There appears to be a tug-of-war now between the AI bubble bears and the AI/Hyperscaler bulls who say the foundation for huge technological change is upon us. With the potential for a December rate cut back on the table, that could fuel an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nPre-Market Stock Futures:\n\nThe shortened holiday week is here, and the futures are trading higher this morning. Most traders and investors are returning with a severe case of whiplash after the stock market posted some of the wildest swings we have seen this year last week. Skyrocketing after the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings and then plunging. An attempt on Thursday to follow through fell apart before noon, and stocks ended in the red. Friday offered the promise of a rally after New York Fed President John Williams said more rate cuts were possible. That fizzled by mid-morning, only to reverse again in the afternoon, ending Friday with all the major indices substantially higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last seen on Friday at 46,245, up 1.08%; the S&P 500 closed at 6602, up 0.98%; and the NASDAQ, which took the biggest shots last week, at 22,273, up 0.88%. With attendance on Wall Street likely to slow by Wednesday, look for a break in the recent extreme volatility.\n\nTreasury Bonds:\n\nYields were lower across the curve on Friday as buyers returned to take advantage of earlier-week selling. Needless to say, the comments from the New York Fed President boosted the potential for a December 25 basis-point cut, which would bring the Fed funds rate to 3.50%-3.75%, in turn spurring Friday's positive trading. The 30-year-long bond closed the session at 4.72% while the benchmark 10-year note finished the day at 4.07%.\n\nOil and Gas:\n\nThe oil energy complex once again took it in the chin on Friday as both of the major benchmarks finished the day lower. The impetus behind the selling was again attributed to the potential settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war, in which President Trump told President Zelensky of Ukraine he wanted an answer on his peace proposal by Thanksgiving Day. Brent Crude closed trading Friday at $62.49, down 1.4% while West Texas Intermediate was last seen down 1.69% at $58, the lowest close for the Texas Tea since last May. Natural gas was the only winner Friday, finishing up 2.19% at $4.57. With prospects for a cold winter and rising electricity demand, investors need to look at the top stocks in the sector now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGold:\n\nGold was flat on Friday, closing modestly lower at $4,064. While the bullion churned back and forth all last week, the critical $4,000 support level appears to be holding. As we reported last week, the UBS team sees the potential for Gold to reach $4,900 as early as the first quarter of 2026.\n\nCrypto:\n\nThe crypto market experienced a sharp downturn early on Friday, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) slumping to multi-month lows. This was part of a broader \"flight from risk\" as investors moved away from riskier assets amid concerns over tech stock valuations and U.S. interest rate uncertainty. Friday's stock market reversal helped stem some of the damage, with Bitcoin trading at $83,750 at 4 PM EST and Ethereum at $2,741. Please keep in mind that cryptocurrencies trade 24/7/365.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Its Founders Say They Bootstrapped Their Success", "content": "Twin sisters Taylor Capuano and Casey Sarai found themselves at a crossroads in their careers in 2022. Instead of taking a more traditional route, the women elected to start their own company, Cakes Body, which now does millions in sales each year.\n\nThree years ago, Capuano was a marketing manager at the clothing brand Life Is Good and had just welcomed her first child. Stepping into motherhood left her desiring more flexibility in her working life, she told CNBC. Meanwhile, Sarai was a marketing manager at Pernod Ricard and was struggling with pandemic-era layoffs that had made her job much more difficult.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon \u2014 Invest at $0.86/Share Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nBoth women \"desperately needed a path\" forward, Capuano told the outlet. So they decided to take a gamble on starting their own business, feeling that \"there was really nothing to lose.\"\n\nCakes Body's early success\n\nThe pair spent some time brainstorming pain points in their own lives and potential solutions before settling on the idea of producing a new type of silicone nipple cover, they told CNBC. Unlike other silicone nipple covers on the market, theirs would be larger, made of a higher quality silicone that tapered at the edges, and would stick to skin without any potentially irritating adhesive.\n\nOnce they had settled on a prototype they liked, Capuano and Sarai each took $5,000 from their personal savings accounts to invest in the business. They spent the money on 500 units, as well as an online store and social media advertisements.\n\nTrending: Bill Gates Says Climate Change \u2018Needs to Be Solved' \u2014 This Award-Winning Building Material Is Tackling It Head-On\n\nFive months after launch, Cakes Body had its first viral moment when a TikTok hit 1 million views. The viral video helped the sisters sell out their initial stock.\n\n\"It was very exciting and it gave [us] the first glimmer of hope,\" Capuano told CNBC. Still, the sisters were nervous about quitting their full-time jobs, worried that the viral moment wouldn't be sustained. It would take several more rounds of sold-out stock before they both decided to take the plunge, making Cakes Body their full-time gigs.\n\nThe Shark Tank effect\n\nBy the end of their first full year in business, Cakes Body topped $1 million in revenue, a spokesman for the company told CNBC. But the sisters weren't satisfied with that level of success.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo, in 2023, they took their nipple covers to \"Shark Tank,\" where they made a deal with Skims and Good American co-founder Emma Grede. The deal, which saw Grede invest $30,000 in exchange for 10% of the company, valued Cakes Body at $3 million.\n\nGrede's investment is currently the only outside money the company has accepted. \"We just knew: \u2018This is a simple solution that is helping us. I wonder if other people will find it useful,' Capuano told CNBC about the sister's decision to bootstrap their growth instead of taking on outside funding.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

Capuano now works full-time as the company's chief creative officer, and Saria is its CEO.\n\nThe sisters told CNBC that their plans for the future include international expansion and continued growth in the brick-and-mortar space. In August, the company launched in Ulta(NASDAQ:ULTA) and is now sold in 1,000 stores around the country.\n\nDespite their initial fears that Cakes Body's success would be fleeting, they encourage others who have a similar dream to take the plunge.\n\n\"There is a moment where you have to take a leap of faith of either ordering the inventory or putting out the first Instagram post,\" Capuano told CNBC. As long as you're product is solving a problem in a market that has room for financial growth, it\u2019s worth plunging ahead, she added.\n\nRead Next: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets \u2014 Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Investors punished Meta Platforms for its planned increase in expenditures on AI. But they're missing the bigger picture. Construction and engineering firm Fluor may not be a great growth name, yet it's compelling because it's so different than most other stocks. Then there's the other thing. 10 stocks we like better than Vertiv \u203a\n\nIt's a tricky time to be in the market. Most investors understand stocks as a whole -- and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in particular -- are overvalued; we're even seeing hints that a correction may be brewing. Yet it still feels like the biggest risk here isn't being in the market, but rather out of it.\n\nFortunately, there's a smart, strategic solution. You can remain in the market but also defend your portfolio with stocks that may be a bit off the beaten path, already beaten-down, or countercyclical names that perform independently of most other stocks.\n\nHere's a prospect of each type.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nVertiv\n\nVertiv(NYSE: VRT) isn't a household name. In fact, there's a good chance you've never even heard of it. The $65 billion technology-support outfit only doing about $8 billion worth of business per year just doesn't turn many heads.\n\nWhat this company lacks in size, however, it more than makes up for in growth potential.\n\nSimply put, Vertiv offers \"critical infrastructure technologies,\" mostly to data centers. This includes power supplies, cooling solutions, racks, and more. Whereas Nvidia makes processors and Broadcom makes the equipment that links them together, Vertiv gives this tech a (literal) framework to attach to, and then helps owners/operators keep these power-hungry, heat-generating platforms up and running.\n\nIt's not the only name in the business. Companies like Applied Digital and DigitalOcean also operate in this space. There's arguably enough business to go around for each of these outfits, though. An outlook from IoT Analytics predicts the worldwide data center infrastructure market is poised to grow at an annualized pace of 23% through 2030. Vertiv can distinguish itself within the industry by leveraging its OneCore and SmartRun tech, which are pre-fabricated data center solutions that can be installed in less time than establishing a new data center would normally take. They're a big reason the company's expected to report top-line growth of 28% and 20% this year and next, respectively, in fact.\n\nPerhaps of more interest to investors is that Vertiv's relative lack of name recognition actually works in its favor. Shares of the already profitable and fast-growing company are reasonably priced at only a little over 30 times next year's projected per-share earnings.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nVertiv may be unknown, but Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) certainly isn't. The $1.5 trillion outfit is parent to social networking platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, where 3.5 billion people check in (combined) every single day.\n\nIt's curious. For all the fatigue people say they have from using the site at the same time other advertising mediums are materializing, the world certainly continues to expand its usage of these social media platforms. Last quarter's active user headcount was up 8% year over year, driving a 14% increase in ad impressions. Meanwhile, a 10% increase in ad prices contributed to a 26% year-over-year improvement in total revenue. Clearly, the company is still doing something right. That, or maybe Facebook has just become so deeply integrated into people's daily routines that they now visit the site without even thinking about it.\n\nEither way, why is the stock a buy here and now? Mostly because -- unlike many of its consumer-facing technology peers -- this one is way down for no great reason. Indeed, shares have lost about one-fourth of their value just since September, mostly in response to news that it would be investing more in artificial intelligence this year than initially planned. At a time when Wall Street is already weary of AI spending that isn't producing a clear return on the investment, investors flinched.\n\nThis doubt arguably takes the wrong long-term view of Meta's spending on artificial intelligence, however.\n\nSee, this company is uniquely positioned to actually do something constructive with this tech, like improving the relevance of ads displayed at Facebook (or now even within Instagram), or simply offering AI-powered tools to Facebook's users.\n\nThis might help: Despite the heavy spending and the stock's subsequent weakness, analysts aren't discouraged. The analyst community still contends Meta shares are worth $838.38 apiece, up more than 40% from the ticker's present price.\n\nFluor\n\nFinally, add Fluor(NYSE: FLR) to your list of top stocks to buy if you've got $1,000 you're ready to put to work.\n\nIt's a construction company, mostly, although the categorization doesn't quite do it justice. Fluor doesn't build houses. It constructs chemical plants, bridges, factories, airports, power plants (including nuclear reactors), life sciences labs, and, yes, data centers, just to name a few. All of these are increasingly in demand due to population growth, aging infrastructure, and technological leaps that justify investments in upgraded facilities. This growing demand is also largely unfazed by economic malaise; if a city or state needs a new bridge, it needs it regardless of the cost or the economy's ability to generate tax revenue.\n\nThere is an arguable downside. That is, even in a \"good\" year, Fluor is unlikely to produce double-digit revenue growth or consistent earnings growth. It's just the nature of the business -- even if funding is reliably available, it's often complicated and time-consuming to get this kind of money flowing to pay for such massive projects.\n\nThe long-term opportunity is there though, even if the company's hit-and-miss quarterly results are causing short-term volatility for the stock. Investors can use this volatility to their advantage, in fact, as it's recently dragged FLR shares back to where they were trading in the middle of last year. This isn't a stock that stays down this much for very long.\n\nMore importantly to investors, though, Fluor stock is different than most of the other names likely to already be in your portfolio. It moves relatively independently of the rest of the market, somewhat shielding it from any marketwide weakness that may or may not be brewing.\n\nThe kicker: The World Nuclear Association says there are 70 new nuclear power plants currently under construction plus another 110 planned, versus 440 up and running right now. If nuclear energy is going to make the comeback it looks like it's going to, Fluor features prominently in that rebirth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vertiv right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vertiv, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vertiv wasn\u2019t one of them.

Earnings per share of $0.37 also declined year over year and fell short of expectations for $0.39 per share.\n\nThe seller of soaps and body lotions also said it doesn't expect much improvement this year, due to negative consumer sentiment.

It also lowered its full-year net sales profit to a decline of low single digits from growth of 1.5% to 2.7% previously.\n\nFull-year earnings per share are now expected to be at least $2.83. The Street was looking for guidance of $3.33.\n\nOn the company's earnings call, Bath & Body Works CEO Daniel Heaf, who joined the company in May, said Bath & Body Works failed to adapt to changing consumer preferences and outlined a plan to turn the company around over the next couple of years, emphasizing that the strategic reset will take \"time and focus.\"\n\n\"Over the years, consumers have evolved,\" Heaf said on the earnings call. \"They seek greater efficacy, ingredient-led products, modern packaging, ... storytelling, and elevated multichannel experiences.

There, Walmart is optimistic too.\n\n\"Holiday is off to a pretty good start,\" Rainey said on the company's earnings call. \"Back-to-school tends to be an early indicator for how that goes, Halloween, likewise for Thanksgiving, and everything that we've seen so far makes us optimistic and encouraged about customers and members leaning into the seasonal events and holiday shopping period.\" Thu, November 20, 2025 at 12:41 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWalmart earnings surpass estimates as retailer lifts guidance\n\nYahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports:\n\nRead more here.

[1]\n\nThe filings from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) provide a rare glimpse into the President\u2019s growing investment portfolio.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has cut interest rates once since January, by 0.25% in October (2). The next Federal Reserve meeting is scheduled for December, and will be the last of the year. Trump\u2019s bond-heavy portfolio signals a bet on interest rates dropping. After all, he\u2019s pressuring the Federal Reserve to make that happen.

Here\u2019s how it could also work for you\n\nAccording to Forbes, Trump\u2019s estimated net worth is $6.1 billion. His wealth increased by more than $3.2 billion in the past year, and his aggressive bond purchases could further accelerate this trend. [4]\n\nBut beyond bonds, the impact of falling interest rates could also trickle down to everyday Americans in other ways.\n\nAn unprecedented bond binge\n\nU.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) documents show that Trump began his buying spree one day after his inauguration on January 20. He made roughly 690 transactions through Aug. 1.\n\nHis purchases span a wide range of debt instruments \u2014 from bonds issued by the New York Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, to those linked with hospital facilities, airports, school districts, and regional development funds nationwide.\n\nAs Reuters reports, Trump also invested heavily in corporate bonds from megabanks like Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. He also holds significant investments in Qualcomm, T-Mobile USA, Home Depot, UnitedHealth Group, and Meta. [5]\n\nNotably, the filings show no sales of bonds, suggesting Trump is positioning for potential price gains if market conditions shift.\n\nThis level of trading by the President raises questions about possible conflicts of interest. The administration could influence policies affecting corporations and municipalities whose debt Trump owns.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHow Trump\u2019s bet could impact Americans\n\nIf Trump wins his bet and interest rates decline, it will affect everyday Americans. Whether you will benefit from the shift depends on whether you plan to borrow or save money.\n\nBorrowers win:\n\nHomebuyers: If you're an aspiring homeowner, a mortgage rate drop from 7% to 6.5% on a $450,000, 30-year loan could reduce monthly payments by $150. [6]\n\nCredit card holders: Variable-rate APRs tend to decline when the Federal Reserve cuts rates.\n\nConsumers with debt: Auto loans, personal loans, and lines of credit become more affordable for borrowers post-rate cuts.

And in a market obsessed with pace, Qwen's early ramp could be one of the faster adoption arcs in China outside Meta's Threads, a signal that investors may not want to overlook.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BABA. Is BABA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe question now is whether Alibaba can turn that pop of momentum into something durable. Kenny Ng at China Everbright Securities International suggested that Qwen's ability to lift Alibaba's to-consumer business could be a meaningful swing factor for the company's future valuation, especially as investors instinctively compare its trajectory to OpenAI. Management is already leaning into that narrative: under CEO Eddie Wu, Alibaba has repositioned itself as an AI-first company and plans to layer agentic AI features into Qwen that support online shopping across platforms such as Taobao. Even its wider ecosystem is moving in sync. Over the weekend, Ant Group disclosed that its own multimodal AI assistant, LingGuang, topped one million downloads in just four days.\n\nThat sets the stage for a potentially consequential investor conversation. Alibaba said it plans to weave digital maps, food delivery, travel booking, office tools, e-commerce, education, and health guidance directly into the Qwen app a bid to turn it into a single AI-driven consumer entry point. Those ambitions could be top of mind when management faces investors during Tuesday's quarterly results. For now, the download numbers offer an early hint that Alibaba may be entering a new phase, one where mass-market AI adoption becomes a possible driver of both sentiment and valuation.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-chatgpt-rival-explodes-10m-114952764.html", "symbols": ["1FB.MI", "BABA.BA", "BABA.US", "BABAF.US", "FB20.F", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.HM", "FB2A.MU", "M1TA34.SA", "META.US"], "tags": ["AI", "CHINA", "EARNINGS", "QUARTERLY RESULTS", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.93, "neg": 0.022, "neu": 0.914, "pos": 0.064}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T11:45:00+00:00", "title": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Is Selling CoreWeave, Tesla, and Nvidia and Piling Into 2 Recent IPOs", "content": "Key Points\n\nPhilippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, a fund that invests in both publicly traded stocks and private companies. In the third quarter, Coatue trimmed its positions in several artificial intelligence (AI) giants, indicating that investors have become somewhat wary of the sector. However, Coatue's third-quarter 13F filing showed ownership in several recent initial public offerings that got off to a strong start earlier this year. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a tiger cub, meaning he's part of an elite group of investors who worked for Julian Robertson's Tiger Global Management in the 1990s and then went on to found his own fund, Coatue Management. Laffont made early investments in TikTok's parent company ByteDance, Snap, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Spotify, among others.\n\nNeedless to say, Laffont can typically spot the big tech trends before they happen, which is why investors are always so eager to get a glimpse into Coatue's portfolio each quarter. In the third quarter, Coatue trimmed its positions in CoreWeave(NASDAQ: CRWV), Tesla, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and invested in two recent initial public offerings.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPairing exposure to the artificial intelligence sector\n\nCoatue appeared to follow the broader institutional investor landscape in the quarter, reducing its stake in several prominent artificial intelligence (AI) companies. Coatue sold 62% of its position in the AI data center company CoreWeave, 15% of its position in the electric vehicle and robotaxi company Tesla, and 14% of its position in the AI chip giant Nvidia.\n\nIn recent months, investors have become increasingly concerned about AI valuations, which have long been high, as well as the macroeconomic environment, with investors penciling in a smaller chance of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December. Furthermore, other AI concerns have emerged, including the large amounts of money the hyperscalers are spending to build out AI infrastructure, which is expected to be in the trillions over the next five years.\n\nOther well-known investors like Michael Burry have been more outspoken on social media regarding concerns over how large AI companies like Oracle and Meta Platforms are accounting for depreciation of semiconductors and servers, specifically as they extend the useful life of them, despite uncertainty about how long they will really last.\n\nOther broader concerns that are coming into the spotlight are whether the U.S. can generate enough electricity to meet the demand for AI. Manufacturing AI chips also requires significant water usage, another issue related to the amount of resources needed to power AI.\n\nStory Continues\n\nUltimately, it's difficult to predict what will happen next in terms of whether this marks the beginning of a pullback or a buy-the-dip opportunity. I don't think AI is about to become irrelevant, but the sector's path is unclear. Investors should be long-term-focused, and in my view, try to avoid some of the higher valuations out there, such as Tesla's.\n\nRevealing positions in two IPOs\n\nOn its third-quarter 13F filing, Coatue reported positions in both the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company Klarna(NYSE: KLAR) and the collaborative design tech company Figma(NYSE: FIG), both of which were high-profile IPOs this year.\n\nFigma went public with tremendous hype, opening at $33 per share and rising to a high of $143 per share, although it would be short-lived. The company essentially provides a Google Docs-like workflow for designers and coders to collaborate on a range of projects, allowing multiple people to work on designs that can be easily translated into code for website or app implementation. The company also has AI components and is being integrated as a third party into ChatGPT.\n\nCoatue actually got involved in the company prior to the IPO, investing in it in 2024 at a $12.5 billion valuation. While selling the stock immediately following the IPO and the huge jump would have been a no-brainer, IPOs often contain lock-up provisions preventing this practice. At the end of the third quarter, Coatue held over 3.2 million shares.\n\nInvestors should still likely be wary of the stock, which has come down significantly after the initial IPO pop. Even at its current $18 billion market cap, Figma is still unprofitable and trades at over 17 times forward revenue.\n\nCoatue also reported owning 330,000 shares of Klarna at the end of the third quarter. I haven't found any evidence that Coatue ever participated in a private financing round of Klarna prior to this report, although it's certainly possible. However, it's also possible that Coatue recently scooped up shares. Klarna's IPO also started hot, but has since fallen below its IPO price.\n\nKlarna trades at a more reasonable valuation than Figma, at about 4 times forward revenue, but its losses have also risen significantly. BNPL companies are heavily impacted by the health of the consumer and the economy, so while the company has potential to disrupt the credit card space, I am still cautious on Klarna at this valuation.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

X, the platform previously known as Twitter, quietly rolled out an account information feature to bring more transparency to the network and call out bots or bad actors. It allows users to see where an account is based, how many times usernames were changed, the original join date, and how the X app was downloaded.\n\n_Bigger picture:_ Instagram (META [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META]) has had a similar feature for a while, but also includes \"not shared\" statuses.

The two trials were randomised, double-blinded, enrolled a total of 3808 adults and evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide compared to placebo on top of standard of care. The decision to pursue an Alzheimer\u2019s disease indication with semaglutide was based on real-world evidence studies, pre-clinical models as well as post-hoc analyses from diabetes and obesity trials.\n\nThe evoke and evoke+ trials did not confirm superiority of semaglutide versus placebo in the reduction of progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as measured by the change in Clinical Dementia Rating \u2013 Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score compared to baseline. While treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related biomarkers in both trials, this did not translate into a delay of disease progression.\n\nIn the evoke trials with patients aged 55-85, suffering from mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with previous semaglutide trials. To date, more than 37 million patient-years of semaglutide exposure have occurred across diverse patient populations.\n\n\u201cBased on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer\u2019s disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide\u2019s potential, despite a low likelihood of success. We are proud to have conducted two well-controlled phase 3 trials in Alzheimer\u2019s disease that meet the highest standards of research and rigorous methodology,\u201d said Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research and Development at Novo Nordisk. \u201cWe sincerely thank all participants and their caregivers for their meaningful contributions. While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities.\u201d\n\nThe 1-year extension period in the evoke and evoke+ trials will be discontinued based on the efficacy results observed in the overall study population. Topline results from the evoke/evoke+ trials will be presented at the Clinical Trials in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (CTAD) conference on 3 December 2025, and full results at the 2026 Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s Diseases Conferences (AD/PD) in March 2026.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAbout Alzheimer\u2019s disease\r\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all dementia cases worldwide. Dementia is a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive disease, where symptoms gradually worsen over time. Each stage of the disease presents different challenges for those living with the disease and their care partners. There is a significant unmet need for new treatment options that can slow down the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and reduce the overall burden on people affected and on society.\n\nAbout Clinical Dementia Rating \u2013 Sum of Boxes\r\nThe\u00a0Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) is a global measure of cognition and function obtained by interviewing both patient and care partner, commonly used staging tool for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in research settings. It measures six areas covering cognition and function, where each area is scored between 0 (no dementia) and 3 (severe dementia). The summary score of the six areas (maximum score of 18), referred to as sum of boxes (CDR-SB) has been applied to clinical trials in Alzheimer\u2019s disease to track progression and assess disease severity.\u00a0In the evoke and evoke+ trials, the change in CDR-SB for semaglutide compared to placebo was measured from baseline to week 104.\n\nAbout the evoke/evoke+ studies\r\nEvoke and evoke+ are large-scale trials investigating the disease-modifying potential of semaglutide in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. They are global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory phase 3 trials investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily oral semaglutide 14 mg versus placebo in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The trials included men or women aged 55\u201385 years with MCI (defined as CDR global of 0.5) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (defined as CDR global score of 1.0) with confirmed amyloid positivity. In the evoke and evoke+ trials, 1,855 and 1,953 people respectively, were randomised 1:1 to semaglutide or placebo for 156 weeks (104-week main treatment phase and 52-week extension).\n\nAbout semaglutide\r\nSemaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist marketed under the brand names Ozempic\u00ae and Rybelsus\u00ae for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and Wegovy\u00ae for the treatment of chronic weight management.\n\nAbout Novo Nordisk\r\nNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

Bond buyers are starting to worry about being compensated for the risks of a bubble in the sector, given recent turmoil in tech stocks.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is that a flood of data center financing could cause supply indigestion, particularly in dollars, but with euro markets also absorbing part of the funding needs,\u201d said JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Matthew Bailey.\n\nInvestors are now questioning whether these massive investments in artificial intelligence will pay off. There are no broad signs of panic in credit, with many of the sales so far having come from top-tier names.\n\nAlphabet raised $17.5 billion in the US and \u20ac6.5 billion ($7.5 billion) in Europe, the second-largest corporate deal in the region this year, while Meta sold $30 billion and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) did $18 billion. Demand was huge, with Meta getting a record peak orderbook of $125 billion.\n\nSupply Glut\n\nHedge fund Man Group Plc noted that high-yield firms are also issuing, including former bitcoin miners. These companies\u2019 data center plans come with \u201caggressive deadlines\u201d and a heavy reliance on the supporting lease contracts, it said in a blog post titled \u201cWhy Bond Investors Aren\u2019t Totally Buying the AI Hype.\u201d\n\n\u201cA glut of supply of lower quality names in the AI space might be too much for markets to stomach,\u201d Man Group\u2019s Jon Lahraoui and Hugo Richardson wrote. \u201cThe hyperscaler frenzy continues, but we remain watchful of future AI slop,\u201d they added.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Bailey estimates that Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, (META) Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) alone have capital expenditure needs of around $570 billion for 2026, up from $125 billion back in 2021. Meanwhile UBS Group AG sees total tech debt supply at over $900 billion next year.\n\nLeer m\u00e1s\n\nThe fact that the big players have strong balance sheets and significant capacity to take on debt means they can offer new issue premiums to appeal to investors that other borrowers may be forced to match, Morgan Stanley analysts warned.\n\n\u201cTech issuers have also shown themselves to be less price-sensitive given the strategic importance of these projects \u2014 a dynamic that can still reprice the broader market,\u201d the US bank said in its recent Global Insights outlook report. \u201cLarge issuers who are less sensitive to price is a new dynamic credit markets haven\u2019t contended with for a long time.\u201d\n\nStill Underinvested\n\nSpreads in the corporate bond market have been mostly range bound this year after recovering from the blow out on April\u2019s US tariff announcements. Driving this has been the huge swathes of cash flowing into the asset class, chasing yields at high levels compared to recent years.\n\nFor European investment-grade investors, the rise in issuance from Big Tech and its diversification for the euro market gives an opportunity for exposure that is currently still underrepresented, according to Marco Stoeckle, head of credit strategy at Commerzbank AG.\n\n\u201cEuro investors are essentially underinvested in high quality US tech issuers,\u201d he said. \u201cDemand therefore should not be the main problem as long as credit profiles remain on the right track.\u201d\n\nMonetization Risk\n\nEven with record overall bond supply in Europe this year, it hasn\u2019t been enough to satiate this demand. Next year, global investment-grade bond issuance is seen rising by 3% in euros and 13% in dollars, skewed toward non-financial companies and AI-related spending from tech firms and utilities, HSBC Holdings Plc wrote in its market outlook.\n\nFinancing AI capex is becoming a defining feature of the fixed income world, according to Brandywine Global Investment Managment portfolio manager Tracy Chen. While she likes data center asset-backed securities for stable credit fundamentals and relative insulation from any consumer fragility, she highlighted future monetization risk, or the potential to generate enough revenues.\n\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology initiative this year released a report indicating that 95% of organizations are getting zero return from generative AI projects. Investors and lenders are already hedging their bets by trading more derivatives that offer payouts if individual tech companies default on their debt.\n\n\u201cRefinancing risk and the maturity wall will become more acute if the macro market destabilizes,\u201d Chen said.

Morgan analysts estimated recently.\n\n\"The potential for this data center capacity spend to come to the investment-grade market means you could have a significant re-levering \u200din a new sector, and it could become a material risk to the high-grade market,\" said Robert Cohen, director of global developed credit at DoubleLine, a bond-focused investment firm managing $90 billion in assets.\n\n\"You've got a large new sector that'\u200bs clearly unproven, and that would change the risk profile of investment-grade credit quite substantially from where it is \u200ctoday, that's my concern,\" he said in an interview.\n\nRising debt at tech companies has added a new layer of concern to broader financial markets that, despite being fueled by the promise of high AI returns, remain wary that the technology has yet to deliver the profits needed to justify such large capital spending.\n\nMeanwhile, although U.S. investment-grade credit spreads remain near historic lows, they have edged wider in recent weeks, reflecting growing unease over the surge of new \u2060bond supply coming to market. Spreads widened to 86 basis points \u200bon Friday, their widest since the end of June, the ICE \u200bBofA US Corporate Index showed.\n\nThe U.S. investment-grade bond market is worth about $9.2 trillion, according to the ICE BofA US Corporate Index.\n\nCohen said the corporate bond market remained in good shape \u200ddue to several factors including a \u2060strong economy, healthy corporate balance sheets, lower interest rates than over the past few years, and expectations of an accommodative Federal Reserve going forward.\n\nBut, while not an imminent risk, he said he was \"\u2060on alert\" about bond issues from tech companies flooding the market and cautious about adding exposure to their debt.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"They are building capacity to provide \u200csupport for, ultimately, a product where the end use is not super clear,\" he said.\u200c\n\n(Reporting by Davide Barbuscia; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doubleline-wary-ai-funding-wave-110658552.html", "symbols": ["1AMZN.MI", "1FB.MI", "1GOOG.MI", "1GOOGL.MI", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEC.F", "AMZ.DU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.HM", "AMZ.MU", "AMZ1.F", "AMZN.BA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.SN", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "FB20.F", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.HM", "FB2A.MU", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX"], "tags": ["AI", "BONDS", "DEBT", "INVESTMENT-GRADE", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.945, "neg": 0.06, "neu": 0.841, "pos": 0.099}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T11:00:02+00:00", "title": "AI-Linked Debt Deluge Is Adding to Market Jitters", "content": "$90 billion The AI hyperscalers\u2014Amazon.com, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Oracle\u2014have issued nearly this much in investment-grade bonds since the start of September.

Meta Platforms has fallen since Druckenmiller bought it in Q3. MercadoLibre is a great way to gain international exposure. 10 stocks we like better than Amazon \u203a\n\nKeeping tabs on what billionaire hedge fund managers are doing is considered by some to be a great way to initiate investment ideas. While you shouldn't blindly follow what these hedge funds are doing with their investments because every investor has different goals for their portfolio, it can be a good strategy check to make sure you aren't missing out on a good thing.\n\nAs for different goals, it's important to remember that hedge funds tend to invest with an idea of holding a stock for 12 to 18 months, on average. Another reason for investors to do their own due diligence about a potential investment sourced from a hedge fund report is that there is a significant delay between when the stock was purchased and when the report is released. Any fund with greater than $100 million in assets must disclose its trades during the quarter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a Form 13F. That information is then released to the public 45 days after the end of the quarter. So, moves that these hedge funds may have made during Q3 could have happened as long as 135 days prior to release. Plenty could have happened for the company and the stock since then\n\nStill, even after factoring in those parameters, I think the stocks that Stanley Druckenmiller at Duquesne Family Office purchased during Q3 are worthy buys right now. Here are my thoughts on three of them.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nDruckenmiller opened a position in Q3 on Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). He's had an on-again, off-again relationship with Amazon, as he previously owned shares during Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. He purchased 437,000 shares of Amazon during Q3, which is valued at nearly $100 million right now. The stock makes up about 2.4% of his total portfolio value, so it's not an insignificant bet.\n\nAmazon has delivered strong results throughout 2025, yet it has lagged behind its peers in stock price performance. Druckenmeiller's bet could be on Amazon reemerging as a top investment pick, which wouldn't surprise me considering how strong Amazon's business looked during Q3.\n\nDuring 2025's Q3, Amazon's e-commerce business grew at an impressive 10% pace year over year. This is a rare feat, because over the past few quarters, this growth rate has been around the high single digits. The bigger growth drivers of Amazon's business continue to be its advertising service and cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Both of these divisions grew revenue at their fastest pace in over a year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmazon is an excellent stock pick and is primed to go on a strong run in 2026 if its business can maintain its current trajectory. Druckenmiller is hoping to tap into that.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) looks a lot different now in Q4 than it did during the third quarter. After it reported its Q3 earnings in late October, the stock dropped like a rock.Data by YCharts.\n\nThis means that Druckenmiller's brand new, $56 million position in Meta Platforms is very likely losing money for him right now. The drop occurred because of investors' concern regarding guidance for increased data center capital expenditure to help boost its artificial intelligence capabilities. These raised capital expenditures have investors worried that the investments won't pay off, and are giving some investors flashbacks to the company's metaverse-related spending spree during 2022.\n\nWhile I think AI has a far more relevant use case than the metaverse ever did, this spending has many investors concerned that it might outpace Meta's cash flows and require added debt. The concerns, however, overshadowed Meta's excellent Q3 results, which saw revenue grow 26% year over year on the back of strong advertising growth on its social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.\n\nI think this short-sighted thinking by the market provides investors with an excellent buying opportunity right now on what has become a discounted stock, and they can be confident that Meta will be a winning stock pick over the next few years, as it may take some time for the market to regain confidence in Meta after its AI spending spree is over.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nLast is MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI). MercadoLibre is a dominant force in Latin America and has a massive market share in e-commerce and payment processing in that region of the world. It has been a long-term successful stock pick, and is a great way to diversify away from U.S. markets and anything AI-centric.\n\nMercadoLibre is already a fairly large holding for Druckenmiller, and it accounts for about 3.5% of his portfolio. Druckenmiller only added 4,600 shares during Q3, increasing his position by about 9%. With MercadoLibre still trading down from recent highs, I think this is another smart stock to add to, as it has a long track record of success and is a great diversification investment for investors of all types.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia\u2019s NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL,\u00a0Tesla\u2019s TSLA and Meta META.\n\nMag 7 Earnings Outlook Improves: A Closer Look\n\nNvidia\u2019s beat-and-raise quarterly results have eased the market\u2019s AI-centric worries for now, but the issue is unlikely to go away completely.\n\nThe chipmaker has been a big beneficiary of the ongoing AI-focused spending surge, as it is Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units that are running the datacenters. The stock has lost ground as the aforementioned worries took hold at the start of this month, but it is still up more than +35% this year, handily outperforming the broader market.\n\nThe broader Mag 7 group, of which Nvidia is a key member, has returned largely in-line with the broader market, up +13.7% vs. a gain of +14.1% for the S&P 500 index. The market doesn\u2019t appear to be equally worried about all AI players in the ongoing pullback, with\u00a0Alphabet continuing to get credit for its efforts even as Meta and some of the others get shunned.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +57.3% from the same period last year on +62.5% higher revenues, putting the company on track to more than double its full-year 2025 earnings from the year-earlier level. Earnings for next year are currently expected to be up +55%, followed by +26.7% growth in 2027.\n\nThis seemingly decelerating growth trend is solely a function of base effects, as demand trends for Nvidia\u2019s chips remain red hot over the next two years. Demand will eventually moderate as we move past the buildout phase of AI infrastructure, and the stock\u2019s recent weakness is likely a reflection of that.\n\nOne could argue that the stock\u2019s impressive gains over the last few years, that has pushed its market capitalization to over $4 trillion, have already factored in these expectations. But if estimates keep rising, as we are starting to see again following the beat-and-raise quarterly results, then Nvidia shareholders will legitimately expect the stock to sustain its positive trajectory.\n\nIncluding Nvidia, the Mag 7 group\u2019s Q3 earnings increased +28.3% from the same period last year on +18.1% higher revenues, which would follow the group\u2019s +26.4% earnings growth on +15.5% revenue growth.\n\nNot all members of the elite group are equally contributing to the growth pace, ranging from\u00a0Tesla\u2019s -39.5% earnings decline in Q3 to Nvidia\u2019s +57.3% jump and Alphabet\u2019s +33% growth pace.\n\nEstimates for the current period (2025 Q4) are going up, with the current earnings growth rate of +15.4% up from +14.3% a week back and +12.2% two weeks ago.\n\nThe group\u2019s 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +14.6%, followed by +16.8% in 2027.\n\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving.\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.7% weight in the index.\n\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all reports released through Friday, November 21st, we now have Q3 results from 473 S&P 500 members, or 94.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. The reporting cycle has come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with most of the remaining results from the Tech and Retail sectors.\n\nTotal earnings for these companies are up +15.6% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 83.4% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Retail sector, we now have Q3 results for 83.3% of the sector\u2019s members in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail companies are up +16.9% from the same period last year on +7.7% higher revenues, with 72% beating EPS estimates and 84% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nPlease note that the +15.2% earnings growth rate for Q3 represents the blended growth rate for the quarter, which combines the actual results for the 473 companies that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies.\n\nIn terms of S&P 500 index \u2018EPS,\u2019 these growth rates approximate to $261.68 for 2025 and $292.52 for 2026.\n\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here\u00a0>>>>Q3 Earnings Season: Retail Sector in Focus\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Photo: AFP>\n\nChina exported US$7.3 billion worth of transformers and US$4.3 billion worth of high-voltage gas-insulated switchgears (GIS) in the first 10 months of the year, up 37.8 per cent and 28.5 per cent, respectively, from a year earlier. That compares with a 5.3 per cent rise in overall outbound shipments.\n\nTransformers are critical components for transmitting electricity remotely and efficiently, while GIS offers safer solutions to manage electricity and support the integration of volatile power generated by wind and solar energy.\n\nThanks to strong overseas demand, power transmission and distribution equipment giant Sieyuan Electric, for example, saw its revenue jump about 33 per cent and its net profit soar 47 per cent for the first nine months of the year compared with a year earlier. The Shenzhen-listed company's exports already surpassed domestic sales in the first half.\n\nLooking ahead, JPMorgan Chase said leading Chinese power equipment makers, together with their Asian peers, could continue to expand in developed markets over a long cycle.\n\nThe US, in particular, could face a shortfall of up to 20 per cent from data centres alone until 2028, according to Morgan Stanley's estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFurthermore, US transformers had been in use for an average of 38 years, creating an urgent replacement demand, Citi said in a report.\n\nEmerging markets are also expected to offer growth opportunities. The digital infrastructure market in Latin America was projected to reach US$12.4 billion by 2027, financial advisory firm Delphos said, while Barclays expected the annual foreign direct investment in Asia-Pacific data centres to jump from US$35 billion in 2024 to US$62 billion by 2030.\n\nIn the first four months of the year, over 60 per cent of sales of Chinese power equipment makers came from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, said Weng Xin, a researcher at CSPI Pengyuan, in a note.\n\nChinese power grid equipment manufacturers were also supported by megaprojects in emerging markets, Weng said.\n\nIn April 2024, State Grid Corporation of China launched a tender for two direct current converter station projects in Saudi Arabia, with an estimated value of over 3 billion yuan (US$422 million). In the same month, the state-owned power giant signed a franchise agreement to invest US$3.6 billion to build an ultra-high-voltage direct current power transmission line in northeastern Brazil.\n\nCiti's Lau said Chinese power grid suppliers received orders equivalent to 12 to 18 months of capacity, compared with up to three years for their Japanese and Korean counterparts.\n\nLau cautioned that Chinese companies could face slower customer payments for orders from some developing countries, which may hurt their cash flow.\n\nBut for the long term, JPMorgan projected earnings visibility for Asian power equipment companies at least until the end of this decade, noting that power generation would likely remain a critical bottleneck for data centre growth.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

You don't need to be as savvy as Buffett to have success in the stock market, because the right index fund can deliver spectacular long-term returns for patient investors. 10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett will retire from his role as CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway holding company at the end of 2025, where for the last 60 years he has overseen numerous wholly owned subsidiaries, in addition to a stock portfolio that's today worth $300 billion. Had you invested just $500 in Berkshire shares when he took the helm in 1965, it would be worth a staggering $24.8 million today.\n\nHowever, Buffett is a seasoned expert, and he knows the average investor would struggle to replicate his incredible ability to pick stocks. Therefore, he often recommends they buy a low-cost exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks a diversified index like the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) instead.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is one great option he has named in the past. Here's how it could turn a consistent investment of $500 per month into $1 million over the long term.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA great index fund for investors of all experience levels\n\nThe S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy. The index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning its largest constituents have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft are the world's most valuable companies, with a combined market capitalization of $11.9 trillion, and all three are in the information technology sector. Hence, this is the largest sector in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.\n\nHere are the top five sectors in the index, along with their weightings, and some of their most noteworthy stocks.\n\nSector Sector Weighting Noteworthy Stocks Information technology 35.06% Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple Financials 13.03% Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Communication services 10.32% Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix Consumer discretionary 10.05% Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's  Healthcare 9.75% Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie\n\nData source: Vanguard, State Street. Sector weightings are accurate as of Nov. 19, 2025, and are subject to change.\n\nThe other six sectors in the S&P 500 are industrials, consumer staples, energy, utilities, real estate, and materials, so the index is highly diversified.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, it's hard to ignore the significant influence of the information technology sector. The S&P 500 soared by 214% over the last 10 years, and the information technology sector was responsible for more than half of that overall gain, thanks to its own eye-popping return of 640%. In fact, if we exclude the sector entirely, the S&P's return over the last decade shrinks to just 79%.\n\nThis dynamic is likely to remain in place thanks to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, quantum computing, and more, which could fuel significant returns in stocks like Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the most cost-effective ways for investors to gain like-for-like exposure to the S&P 500. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. In dollar terms, an investment of $10,000 would incur an annual fee of just $3, whereas that fee could be as high as $74 in other funds, according to Vanguard.\n\nTurning $500 per month into $1 million\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered a compound annual return of 10.5% since its inception in 1957, and if it continues to grow at that pace, it could turn a consistent monthly investment of $500 into $1 million in under 30 years:\n\nMonthly Investment Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $500 $106,829 $409,298 $1,269,709\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nThe S&P has delivered an even better average annual return of 14.4% over the last five years, as themes like AI fueled incredible growth for some of the index's largest constituents, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and more. Just last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors that annual AI infrastructure spending could hit an eye-popping $4 trillion by 2030, so momentum in this space is unlikely to slow anytime soon.\n\nHowever, even though the S&P might continue generating accelerated returns over the next few years, it's also important to remember that volatility is a normal part of the investing journey. According to Capital Group, the index experiences a decline of 10% or more once every two and a half years, on average, and it slips into a bear market (a decline of 20% or more) every six years. These bumps in the road are the price of admission for an opportunity to earn life-changing returns over the long term.\n\nThe key to success is investing consistently, even during uncertain times. Warren Buffett is known for buying stocks in all market conditions, but especially during periods of weakness because as a value investor, he loves a bargain.\n\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

The billionaire closely follows valuation, and it\u2019s driven at least one of his recent investing moves.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet \u203a\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is known for delivering long-term results to investors. At the helm of Duquesne Capital Management, he delivered an average annual return of 30% over three decades -- and never posted a money-losing year. That's why it's worth watching his investing moves, and today you still can do so as Druckenmiller, after closing the fund, continues to invest through the Duquesne family office. There, Druckenmiller oversees about $4 billion in securities.\n\nAnd over the past year, this star investor has made a few shocking moves. Druckenmiller closed out positions in three of the world's most successful companies. In the third quarter of last year, he sold all of his Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares, and he did the same with Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) stock in the first quarter of this year. Finally, in the most recent quarter, Druckenmiller dumped all of his shares of Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) -- and he opened positions in the two cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks.

This is helpful for the rest of us because it offers us a peek into the strategies of some of the world's most successful investors.\n\nNvidia is the leading artificial intelligence (AI) chip designer, and this position has helped the company generate double- and triple-digit growth, with revenue reaching records. Palantir sells AI-powered software platforms that help customers make better use of their data -- so, thanks to Palantir, these customers can immediately apply AI to their real-world situations.\n\nEli Lilly sells one of today's most sought-after products: weight loss drugs. Its blockbuster portfolio is driving revenue growth, and these drugs remain in high demand.\n\nOver the past three years, Nvidia, Palantir, and Lilly have climbed 1,000%, 2,000%, and more than 180%, respectively. Valuations of Nvidia and Palantir have advanced in recent years, and Lilly's took off this year.\n\nDruckenmiller, in an interview with Bloomberg last year, mentioned rising valuation as a reason for selling Nvidia shares. Though we don't know his reasons for selling Palantir and Lilly, it's possible that valuation played a role in those moves, too.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nDruckenmiller's latest moves\n\nNow, let's consider the stocks Druckenmiller bought in the third quarter:\n\nDruckenmiller opened a position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), purchasing 102,200 shares. The stock is the 44th-biggest position out of his 65 stock holdings.The billionaire also opened a position in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), buying 76,100 shares. The stock now is his 18th-largest position.\n\nIt's very possible that valuation may have been one of the reasons Druckenmiller scooped up these players -- they are the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have driven market gains in recent years.\n\nMeta trades for 22x forward earnings estimates, while Alphabet trades for 27x.\n\nCompanies that may benefit from AI\n\nAnd for these prices, Druckenmiller gains access to two companies that may benefit from the AI boom. Meta, known for its social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram, is investing heavily in AI to boost the performance of these apps. The idea is to keep us on them longer. And the company is using AI to improve advertising results for advertisers across its platforms. All of this should result in higher ad spending, and this is key since Meta depends on advertising for growth.\n\nAlphabet, like Meta, is using AI to keep advertisers -- its key source of revenue -- coming back. And Alphabet also offers AI products and services to customers through Google Cloud, its cloud computing business. This already is generating growth, pushing Google Cloud to a 34% revenue gain in the recent quarter.\n\nSo, should you follow Druckenmiller into Alphabet and Meta right now? If you're looking for potential AI winners at a bargain price, the answer is yes -- these companies have solid long-term earnings track records, which should reassure cautious investors, and the potential to supercharge your portfolio over time as the AI revolution reaches its next stages.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Advanced Micro Devices\n\nLeading tech companies will continue to invest in advanced computing hardware until AI surpasses human intelligence. That's where the world is heading. The stakes are enormous, but to achieve this, these companies will need significantly more computing power. This is why investors should consider investing in Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nAMD has navigated through a slump in its growth over the past few years, but the investments it has made to catch up in the AI chip market are starting to pay off. Revenue grew 36% year over year in the third quarter, reaching $9.2 billion. It also reported a 30% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share and record free cash flow, demonstrating how AMD is profitably scaling its business.\n\nIt's just getting started. The company is driving this accelerating growth by offering a superior cost-performance balance compared to competing chips. Its fifth-generation Epyc central processing units (CPUs) for servers continue to gain market share on Intel, while its MI300 series of graphics processing units (GPUs) are valued for their efficiency in handling AI inference workloads.\n\nThe launch of the MI450 GPU next year is expected to drive record revenue. OpenAI is slated to purchase a large cluster of MI450s in the second half of 2026. This is part of a long-term agreement that will make AMD a key strategic partner for the owner of ChatGPT.\n\nThese deals indicate further growth for AMD that could deliver substantial returns for investors. Analysts are currently projecting annualized free-cash-flow growth of 66% through 2029. This is why the stock rocketed to new highs and could offer significant upside.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has over 3.5 billion people using its services daily, with more than 3 billion on Instagram alone. Meta is making these services even more profitable and engaging for users by leveraging AI. With substantial resources to expand its data center capacity, Meta is building an unstoppable competitive advantage around its tech infrastructure.\n\nIts third-quarter financial results were outstanding, with revenue up 26% year over year. Its ad revenue is generating a significant operating margin of 43% on a trailing-12-month basis, contributing to $44 billion in free cash flow.\n\nMeta has made improvements to its ad technology, where AI is driving better efficiency and more relevant ads shown to users. AI-driven ad tools are generating over $60 billion annually, accounting for approximately a third of the company's total revenue.\n\nThe stock is down 20% since the third-quarter earnings report, primarily due to the company's plan to accelerate capital spending over the next year. This is expected to put pressure on margins and profits. However, the additional GPUs and compute capacity will further expand its AI capabilities, potentially leading to lucrative opportunities to generate more profits in the future.\n\nThese investments will strengthen Meta's long-term competitive moat and potentially lead to the development of new AI-driven services. There is considerable long-term upside for Meta that is not fully reflected in its current valuation. The stock is trading at just 20 times 2026 earnings estimates, which appears to be a bargain for a leading tech company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

This is one of the most aggressive rounds of layoffs in the company's history.\n\nThat odd mix of record AI expenditure and big cutbacks is changing how your portfolio is exposed to Big Tech without you even noticing.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI makeover: Record spending, real people out\n\nMicrosoft seems to be unstoppable on the surface.\n\nThe company's Azure cloud business is expanding at a high rate of more than 10%. AI \"copilots\" are built into a variety of things, such as Office and GitHub. The stock is a major part of practically every large-cap index fund.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nInvestors hope good news from Nvidia gives the rally more life Palantir CEO Karp just settled major debate Spotify just solved a major problem for listeners Amazon lawsuit could be a warning to other employers\n\nThe firm is undertaking two things at once behind the scenes:\n\nAI spend surges: Company blog and filings reveal plans to pour $80 billion this fiscal year into AI-ready data centers. Headcount falls: A July memo confirmed over 15,000 layoffs in 2025, including 9,000 in a single month.\n\nSatya Nadella, the CEO, has said that the layoffs are \"weighing heavily\" on him. He has also made it plain that Microsoft is restructuring around AI, which implies that there will be more capital investment and fewer layers of personnel.\n\nThat doesn't make sense from a worker's point of view. Wall Street sees it as the new normal.AI spending reshapes the future of Big Tech operationsShutterstock\n\nThe new Big Tech model is revenue growth not headcount growth\n\nMicrosoft is merely the most obvious illustration of a bigger change.\n\nTech corporations in Silicon Valley are making more money than ever while secretly laying off workers. Over 141,000 IT jobs had been lost in 2025, according to a Washington Post research report that analyzed data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. This is a 17% increase over the same time last year. Over the previous two years, IT jobs have dropped by around 3% a year throughout the country and by over 19% in California.\n\nRelated: Palantir fans: You\u2019re not going to like what just happened\n\nWhy are the cutbacks still happening while AI sales are up through the roof? A few reasons keep popping up:\n\nStory Continues\n\nAI makes each worker more productive, so businesses don't have to recruit back as many people as they used to. The pandemic's \"growth at all costs\" mentality died when borrowing rates went up; boards now want efficiency. Investors like discipline, particularly when a firm can prove that its revenues are going up even when its number of employees is staying the same or going down.\n\nThat\u2019s the world Microsoft, and a lot of other tech giants, are in now. It\u2019s no longer just about beating the top line. It\u2019s about proving it can grow earnings while keeping payroll tight and redirecting cash into AI infrastructure instead.\n\nThe $300 billion AI bill hiding behind the layoffs\n\nThe human part of this is shown in pink slips. On the capex line, you can see the money side.\n\nAnalysts and data-center trackers currently estimate that the four U.S. hyperscalers, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, will spend more than $300 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, primarily for AI-driven data centers and networking, according to CNBC.\n\nRelated: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S26 makes big bet on thin phones, in-house chips\n\nIn a general sense:\n\nMicrosoft plans to spend around $80 billion on AI-focused data centers and cloud infrastructure in fiscal year 2025. Amazon's capital expenditures are estimated to be above $100 billion in 2025. CFO Brian Olsavsky says a significant portion of this money is for AWS and AI. Alphabet boosted its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $91 billion to $93 billion as it pushes to construct AI infrastructure for Search, YouTube, and the cloud.\n\nFor earnings, the trade looks like this:\n\nRight present, layoffs are cutting operational costs since wages and benefits are leaving SG&A and R&D. AI infrastructure shows up as capital expenditures that lose value over time, which means they don't have a big effect on earnings right away. Investors profit if the AI gamble pays off by bringing in more money, greater automation, and higher margins. Shareholders will have to pay for a highly costly weapons race that also costs thousands of people their jobs if it doesn't. Nvidia and other chipmakers are on the opposite side of that deal. Every time Microsoft and other companies fire a team and buy additional GPUs, the \"AI arms dealers\" that sell that technology become a greater part of your portfolio narrative.\n\nFor earnings, the trade looks like this:\n\nAs salary and benefits leave SG&A and R&D, layoffs lower operational costs. AI infrastructure investment depreciates over years, minimizing earnings effect.\n\nIf the AI investment yields more money for AI, leads to greater automation, and results in higher margins, investors benefit. Shareholders will pay for a highly costly weapons race that also costs thousands of people their jobs if it doesn't.\n\nRelated: The $1 billion bet: how Nokia stake fits Nvidia's AI roadmap\n\nNvidia and other chipmakers are on the opposite side of that deal. Every time Microsoft and other companies fire a team and buy additional GPUs, the \"AI arms dealers\" that sell that technology become a greater part of your portfolio narrative.\n\nHow this quiet reset hits your index funds\n\nYou don't have to own Microsoft to be at risk.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the biggest companies in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon are close behind it. You have wagered that their AI-heavy, lean-headcount plan will work if you hold a wide index fund.\n\nRelated: Is Nvidia\u2019s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn\u2019t think so\n\nFor now, Wall Street loves this because:\n\nMore people are working for the company, but revenue is expanding faster than that. In a harder rate environment, cost reduction, simpler org charts, and AI solutions assist protect operational profits. Big AI capital expenditures make it hard for smaller competitors to climb over the moat.\n\nBut it also means your retirement plan is increasingly vulnerable to one fundamental question: Is the AI reward worth the cost in terms of money and people?\n\nFour numbers that tell you if the AI bet is working\n\nYou don't need a spreadsheet full of calculations to see whether Microsoft's AI shift (and the ones that replicate it) is really benefiting you. These four lines from each earnings report reveal much of the story:\n\nRevenue per employee: Rising output with flat or lower headcount signals real AI-driven efficiency. AI capex as % of revenue: A higher ratio shows the company is committing to AI infrastructure. Operating margin trend: Margins must improve despite big AI spending and layoffs. Share count + capital returns: Buybacks and dividends indicate cash flows are strengthening, not just shifting on paper.\n\nYou can get all of this information from Microsoft's filings and investor presentations. The same criteria works for Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Apple.\n\nThe AI bet you already own whether you like it or not\n\nThe new formula from Microsoft is simple: more GPUs and fewer humans.\n\nYou may not have known it, but if you have an S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 fund, you've already voted for that formula. Your money is helping to pay for a $80 billion AI build-out at the same corporation that recently fired more than 15,000 workers.\n\nRelated: Why Nvidia\u2019s 'big sellers' might secretly be its biggest believers\n\nYou don't have to like that trade-off. But you should be able to see it plainly.\n\nFor individual investors in the AI age, the key question isn't simply what Microsoft will make next. When you look at your next quarterly statement and decide whether you still want to own the AI experiment you're in, you have to ask yourself if exchanging bodies for data centers really seems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Nov 23, 2025, where it first appeared in the Economy section.

Amazon Web Services generates gobs of free cash flow that funds the company's other ambitions. Alphabet and Microsoft each generate sizable earnings from a variety of digital segments, including cloud computing infrastructure, where they're both major players. Meta Platforms has its highly profitable \"family of apps\" segment, which brings in more than enough to support its billions of dollars in losses from Reality Labs, which contains its metaverse-related operations. And Nvidia's compute and networking segment continues to deliver jaw-dropping results, while its smaller segments are also highly profitable.\n\nBy contrast, Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) deliveries were trending downward in the first half of 2025, though it remains the market leader. Its energy storage business is on firmer footing, but it makes up a small part of the top line. In the third quarter, Tesla grew automotive revenue just 6% year over year as deliveries rebounded, up 7%. However, the company's operating margin fell to just 5.8% -- a steep decline from 10.8% a year earlier.\n\nTesla is spending a ton of money on artificial intelligence and robotics, but it has yet to see a payoff from those investments.\n\nThis past summer, Tesla launched its autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and it has since expanded it to a few other markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area. However, it remains to be seen how profitable it will be at scale.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, so far, that service is being provided by standard Model Y EVs that have been outfitted with Tesla's Robotaxi technology, not the much-discussed Cybercab, which is not yet in production. And in most markets, regulators are still requiring human monitors for those autonomous vehicles.\n\nThere are better buys than Tesla for 2026\n\nTesla's Robotaxis feature pioneering-edge AI, which presents distinct challenges compared to embedding AI within smartphones or personal computers, so the company deserves credit for making progress in that field.\n\nHowever, the risks of investing in Tesla simply aren't worth the potential rewards at this time, especially given the fact the stock is trading at 178 times expected 2026 earnings.\n\nSince Tesla's valuation appears to be increasingly disconnected from its core EV business and based more on the potential of new ventures that have yet to prove themselves, investors may want to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the stock at this time. There are many other compelling buys in big tech.\n\nStay tuned to find out how the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks stack up in my rankings for 2026.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Meta stock is attractively priced, especially compared with other AI stocks.10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms \u203a\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks, as a group, aren't cheap. AI companies have been investing hundreds of billions of dollars in development, and many of them are already growing quickly. AI is a tremendous long-term opportunity with serious implications in so many arenas, which is why the market gives its stocks a premium. Another reason is that many AI stocks are extremely profitable, which could be a justification for a higher valuation.\n\nBut while some AI stocks sport wild valuations (think Palantir Technologies) or aren't profitable (think CoreWeave), some of the largest and most stable companies in the world are also top AI stocks, and some of them could be undervalued.

AI companies have been investing hundreds of billions of dollars in development, and many of them are already growing quickly.

On November 19, Reuters reported that a federal judge had ruled in favor of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) against the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) charges that the company holds a monopoly in social networking. In the antitrust case, the FTC argued that Meta has been using its deep pockets to suppress competition by purchasing competitors and that Meta should restructure or sell Instagram and WhatsApp to restore competition.\n\nThis win is seen as a substantial positive for the mega-cap technology companies, like Amazon, which are facing other FTC cases. While FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson said that they are disappointed by the ruling, a Meta spokesperson said:\n\n\u201cOur products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth.

What\u2019s Next for the AI Trade?", "content": "Beyond Nvidia, other semiconductor companies are struggling all of a sudden as Wall Street questions the durability of AI spending.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street thought blowout earnings from Nvidia Corp. would calm investors\u2019 nerves about a bubble forming in artificial intelligence stocks. They didn\u2019t.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIndia\u2019s Richest Family Powers\u00a0Push for Green Space in Mumbai Where Train\u00a0Dreams Meet Reality in Texas San Francisco Hotels That Echoed City\u2019s Decline Sell for 75% Off Despite Star Architect\u2019s Alleged Misconduct, New Harlem and Princeton Museums Shine On the French Riviera, Street Reforms\u00a0Come From the Right\n\nSo where does the AI trade stand now? It depends who you ask.\n\nOn one side you have the skeptics. They\u2019re concerned about soaring market valuations as investors chase growth in a small collection of stocks tied to the AI boom. They see the hundreds of billions of dollars these companies are spending to stay in the race as unsustainable, particularly as they start to take on debt in order to keep up. In addition, the circular nature of these financing arrangements creates a potential systemic risk in which one company\u2019s weakness can bring down the entire trade.\n\nThe other side are the optimists, who see the recent pullback in AI-related shares as a healthy correction on the way to further growth. To them, the mega-cap technology firms at the heart of the AI trade \u2014 Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. \u2014 are going to keep spending to develop their offerings, with no signs of slowing anytime soon. Plus, with the industry\u2019s strong demand and a regulatory environment that\u2019s considered accommodating for growth, they view the AI investment cycle as just in the early innings.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a division,\u201d said Dec Mullarkey, managing director at SLC Management. \u201cWe have had such a long bull run and valuations are stretched so the fear of a blow up in AI is high. But then there is another group of investors looking to sources of stimulus to extend the cycle, such as prospects of Fed rate cuts, less regulation, more M&A and increased IPO activity.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty was highlighted by the stock market\u2019s wild swing Thursday in the wake of Nvidia\u2019s earnings report. The chipmaker\u2019s shares initially jumped more than 5%, supporting a host of other AI plays, before reversing direction and closing down 3.2%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes responded in kind, climbing out of the gate and then quickly wiping out those gains to finish well in the red.\n\n\u201cWe saw an initial relief rally on the confirmation that demand is strong, but investors are now asking the next questions, which are, what about the power needs, what about margins, what\u2019s the ROI?\u201d said Natalie Hwang, managing partner of Apeira Capital Advisors. \u201cRelief rallies can\u2019t hold so long as the market has unanswered questions.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors did get some relief on Friday, as the major equities indexes vacillated between gains and losses in the morning before turning decisively positive.\n\nNvidia\u2019s results arrived just as skepticism about AI is starting to spill over into the broader market. Investors are increasingly spooked by the signs of a potential bubble: elevated valuations, circular financing deals, debt issuance, and lofty aspirations that might be difficult to meet, particularly for OpenAI, the privately held ChatGPT owner that is burning through cash.\n\nThe chip giant\u2019s robust earnings weren\u2019t a surprise since the spending plans of its major customers were telegraphed well in advance. Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta and Alphabet \u2014 which taken together represent more than 40% of Nvidia\u2019s sales \u2014 are projected to increase their combined capital expenditures by 34% over the next 12 months to $440 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe quarter itself was, frankly, exceptional,\u201d said Daniel Pilling, portfolio manager at Sands Capital Management, which owns Nvidia shares. \u201cThe forward looking guidance on a revenue basis was 5% ahead of consensus.\u201d\n\nBeyond Nvidia, other semiconductor companies are struggling all of a sudden as Wall Street questions the durability of AI spending. An index of chip-related stocks is down 11% in November and on pace for its worst month since 2022, with companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Arm Holdings sliding more than 20%.\n\nOn the fringes of the business, Sandisk Corp., the maker of memory chips that went public in February, was up almost 700% for the year when it hit a high on Nov. 12, but that figure has been sliced by about a third after a precipitous decline in the past two weeks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the other side of the spending equation \u2014 return on investment \u2014 that investors are really starting to question. When that pile of cash will translate into faster growth and improved profitability for the companies offering AI software and services is now a serious issue. Wall Street needs to have some clarity on ROI for the trade to pick up steam again, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\n\u201cIt may take another quarter or two for us to get evidence of that, and until we do, this is a story that will remain a point of focus for investors,\u201d Luschini said. \u201cSo long as this percolates in the background, it could jeopardize the otherwise sanguine outlook for AI.\u201d\n\nA full reckoning of the ROI question may have been delayed by Nvidia\u2019s report, since it eased immediate concerns about the sustainability of AI investments. While Nvidia is the \u201clynchpin\u201d of the artificial intelligence trade and its results were solid, they didn\u2019t quell doubts about the big spenders, according to Kevin Cook, senior strategist at Zacks Investment Research.\n\nThat\u2019s where the serious cracks are starting to emerge. Meta shares are down 21% since the company reported earnings on Oct. 29, as investors grow concerned about its aggressive capex plans. Microsoft has fallen 13% since its results on the same day for a similar reason. Companies with weaker balance sheets have taken an even bigger hit, with CoreWeave Inc.\u2019s stock plunging 46% this month and Oracle Corp. sinking 24%, on track for its biggest monthly drop since 2001.\n\n\u201cFor all the bubble blowers out there, maybe they were right about stocks like Oracle and CoreWeave getting ahead of their skis because both of those companies need to borrow a lot of money to just play in the game,\u201d Cook said.\n\nAll of which leaves investors divided based on their perspectives - glass half empty or full. The one area of agreement appears to be that the AI ride is going to get even bumpier along the way.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got questions about the macro, divide over where we are in the progress of the AI revolution and cryptocurrencies melting down,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \u201cI think all of that is part and parcel to the volatility we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPermabull Tom Lee Sees Bitcoin as High as $200,000 by January\u2019s End Weed Drinks That Get You Very, Very High Could Be Gone Soon The Dirty Secret of Biodegradable Plastic Cutting Ties With China Is Harder Than Companies Expected The New Requirement for MBAs Seeking Consulting Jobs: AI Proficiency\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-didn-t-save-market-140007853.html", "symbols": ["1NVDA.MI", "700.US", "AMD.US", "AMZN.US", "ARM.US", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "META.US", "MSFT.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US"], "tags": ["AI", "EARNINGS", "EARNINGS REPORT", "ROI", "SEMICONDUCTORS", "VOLATILITY"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.051, "neu": 0.857, "pos": 0.092}}, {"date": "2025-11-23T12:37:46+00:00", "title": "Economic data returns, retail earnings feature in holiday-shortened week: What to watch this week", "content": "As November wraps up, a holiday-shortened week of trading, courtesy of Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, will greet investors who continue to wrestle with the fallout from Nvidia's (NVDA) blockbuster earnings report alongside flagging confidence in the overall AI-driven market.\n\nOn Friday, markets capped a roller-coaster week with daily gains but weekly losses, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell over 2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 1.5% for the week.\n\nA strong September jobs report, strong earnings from Nvidia, and a positive third quarter report from Walmart were all greeted Thursday by one of the market's biggest intraday reversals of the last decade, with the S&P 500 flipping from a gain above 1.5% at the opening bell to a loss of more than 1.5% by market close.

You need patience and vision for the best market strategies to play out.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Carnival Corp.(NYSE: CCL), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are three monster stocks that I think will deliver strong results in the next three years. Let's take a closer look.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nArguing that Nvidia is a monster stock to hold for the next three years may seem a lot like closing the barn door after the race horse has bolted. The leading developer of graphics processing units and artificial intelligence (AI) chips is a nine-bagger over the last three years. Am I three years too late? Am I three months too late?\n\nSome will argue that the last great opportunity to buy Nvidia happened in early April, when Nvidia and most tech stocks were rattled in the early days of the trade war with China. Nvidia was already vulnerable from the problematic buzz a few months earlier that Chinese AI tech start-up DeepSeek was cranking out quality generative AI on the cheap without having to spring for the latest Nvidia hardware. With investors bracing for what was eventually a $4.5 billion charge related to export restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chips, it was in retrospect a great time to buy. Nvidia shares have soared 82% since bottoming out on April 7.\n\nWorrywarts will argue that the days of scintillating gains are over for Nvidia investors. With its $3.8 trillion market cap, Nvidia has reclaimed its spot as the most valuable U.S.-exchange traded stock in the recent rally. There are still tariff headwinds aside from the export restrictions into China. The shares can still go higher.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's latest quarter was a blowout performance. Revenue surged a better-than-expected 65% for its fiscal first quarter, fueled by a 73% jump in its data center revenue. All but 12% of its revenue is now coming from that business, and that's a good thing. Demand for the buildout of data centers remains strong as AI's hunger for computing power intensifies.\n\nIt's not the only thing that's intensifying unfortunately. Nvidia is modeling an $8 billion revenue hit from the export control limitations between the U.S. and China. The stock's pop over the last several weeks has boosted its valuation. Nvidia is now trading for 37 times this fiscal year's expected earnings and 27 times next year's target. It's not a cheap price for most companies, but it is a discount to Nvidia's growth. Nvidia's adjusted earnings exceeded expectations with a 57% increase in its latest quarter, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see Wall Street pros continue to raise their bottom-line forecasts as the the next three years play out.\n\n2. Carnival\n\nIf you're looking for a stock with a lower valuation at the starting line, you might want to consider boarding Carnival. The world's largest cruise line by revenue and passenger count is trading for just 14 times its recently heightened earnings guidance for this fiscal year. The multiple drops to 12 if we look out to what analysts are eyeing for fiscal 2026.\n\nCarnival came through with another beat on both ends of the income statement when it posted its fiscal second-quarter results last week. It's not fair to call this a surprise anymore. The cruise line operator has delivered 11 straight quarters of topping Wall Street profit targets, and in the last six quarters the beats have been by a double-digit-percentage margin.\n\nDemand remains strong for Carnival. It had $8.5 billion in customer deposits for future sailings at the end of its latest quarter, the highest that it's ever been at this point in the year. Carnival is vulnerable to global economic slowdowns or if geopolitical skirmishes grow wider, but for now it's coasting with inviting waters for the next couple of years.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nIf you want a blend of Nvidia's AI-infused tech sizzle and Carnival's attractive valuation, Google parent Alphabet should be able to scratch that itch. Alphabet is gaining ground in the AI space, and it naturally continues to be the world leader in search and the advertising opportunities that come with that pole position. YouTube and its open-source Android platform are also dominant. With a market cap of $2.2 trillion, there are only three other companies outside of Nvidia with larger capitalizations among U.S.-listed stocks.\n\nAlphabet is perpetual grower, making its flat stock performance over the past year -- down 3% over the past 12 months -- even more intriguing. Annual revenue has risen by at least 8% for more than two dozen years. The top-line gains accelerated last year to 14%. This isn't the kind of growth investors are getting out of Nvidia, but the price of admission is more reasonable. It has a forward earnings multiple in the high teens, trading for less than 19 times this year's earnings and 17 times next year's estimate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Professional money managers struggle to beat the S&P 500 on a consistent basis, as evidenced by a bet Buffett made in 2007. The S&P 500 returned 1,820% over the last three decades (10.3% annually), a pace that would turn $450 per month into $940,200.10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history, but some of his best advice is often overlooked by traders in search of the next great stock.\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting in 2021. Investors have several options, but Buffett himself selected the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) when going head-to-head with a hedge fund in the early 2000s.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nFollowing Buffett's advice could turn $450 per month into $940,200. Here's what investors should know.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides exposure to many of the most influential companies\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 tracks the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which measures the performance of 500 large U.S. companies. Included in the benchmark index are value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors. The S&P 500 is usually seen as the best gauge for the overall domestic stock market because it covers about 80% of domestic equities by market value.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 also includes approximately 40% of global equities by market value, meaning it provides exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world. Listed below are the top 10 positions in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF:\n\nNvidia: 8.4%Apple: 6.8%Microsoft: 6.5%Alphabet: 5%Amazon: 4%Broadcom: 2.9%Meta Platforms: 2.4%Tesla: 2.1%Berkshire Hathaway: 1.5%JPMorgan Chase: 1.4%\n\nBuffett once bet $500,000 that he could beat a hedge fund with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffett wagered $500,000 that no professional investor could outperform an S&P 500 index fund over an extended period. He even offered to let the contender select five hedge funds. Only one asset manager accepted the challenge: Buffett went head-to-head with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners between 2008 and 2017 -- and Buffett won.\n\nThe best-performing Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 fund returned 88% during that 10-year period, and the worst fund did so poorly that it was dissolved after nine years. Meanwhile, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF returned 126%, meaning Buffett won the competition by 38 percentage points.\n\nThink about that: With nothing but an S&P 500 index fund, Buffett beat 100-plus financial experts (i.e., each of the five funds was run by a different manager, and each manager invested in many other funds run by other professionals). Yet, those financial experts charge clients exorbitant fees for their services, while the S&P 500 has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning shareholders will pay just $3 annually on every $10,000 in the fund.\n\nHow the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF can turn $450 per month into $940,200\n\nThe S&P 500 achieved a total return of 1,820% over the last 30 years. It compounded at 10.3% annually during that period. Those decades include such a wide variety of economic and market conditions -- three recessions, three bear markets, and 13 market corrections -- that investors can reasonably assume similar returns over long periods in the future.\n\nAt that rate, $450 invested monthly in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would be worth $87,300 after one decade, $320,000 after two decades, and $940,200 after three decades, provided dividends are reinvested.\n\nHere's the bottom line: The S&P 500 has consistently produced stellar returns, such that professionals often struggle to beat the index. That makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF a good option for almost every investor, even those who prefer individual stocks.

IDC research estimates that AI spending will contribute nearly $20 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\n\nBut which companies are poised to benefit over the next decade as AI takes off? Here's why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) should be on your short list of AI stocks.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhile many companies are currently benefiting from artificial intelligence, Nvidia has the potential to continue tapping into this massive trend for many years. Nvidia's GPUs have long been a top choice among tech companies needing the best chips for their data centers, with the company having an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI processor market.\n\nThat lead gives Nvidia a healthy head start in the AI chip race, and the company continues to release new semiconductors to ensure it won't get caught flat-footed. The latest iteration is the company's Blackwell GPU for AI, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on the third-quarter earnings call was already in the hands of top customers and is 2.2x faster than its Hopper GPUs.\n\nHuang is preparing his company for an unprecedented wave of AI data center spending, which he estimates will reach $2 trillion over the next five years.\n\nThe good news for investors is that it won't take years for Nvidia to benefit from AI. In the company's third quarter (ending Oct. 27), revenue increased 94% to $35.1 billion, and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings soared 118% to $0.81 per share. Much of the company's growth is already being spurred by Nvidia's data center segment, which had a 112% sales increase to $30.8 billion in the quarter.\n\nThe one thing to note with Nvidia's stock is that it isn't cheap. The company's shares have a price-to-earnings ratio of 54.5 right now, higher than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 30.6. But with AI spending ramping up and Nvidia leading the pack with its GPUs, there's likely more room for this tech giant to run.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a unique AI investing angle because the company doesn't create any cutting-edge software or high-powered processes. Instead, it manufactures the semiconductors that go into the world's most advanced data centers.\n\nThe company manufactures about 90% of the world's most advanced processors, and business is booming. In the third quarter (ending Sept. 30), the company reported sales of $23.5 billion, up 36% from the year-ago quarter, and an earnings increase of 54% to $1.94 per American depository receipt (ADR).\n\nJust as with Nvidia, huge demand for AI chips over the coming years will likely continue to fuel Taiwan Semiconductor's growth. On the latest earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei said, \"Almost every AI innovator are working with us,\" and added that his company \"... probably gets the deepest and widest growth of anyone in this industry.\" In short, as the $2 trillion in data center spending ramps up, Taiwan Semiconductor will be the main supplier of all the processors.\n\nThough Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is up about 97% over the past year (as of this writing), it's not outrageously expensive, at a P/E ratio of just 29.5. That makes now a good time to pick up shares of the chip manufacturer as AI semiconductor demand ramps up.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone \u2014 don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nJim and his wife, Carla, 60, live in suburban Colorado. Carla works part-time at a local library, bringing in about $18,000 a year, which helps cover health insurance for now. They raised two kids, both grown, and their four-bedroom home is fully paid off. No pensions, no rental income, just a carefully built nest egg worth $980,000 split across three buckets:\n\n$570,000 in a traditional 401(k) $220,000 in a Roth IRA $190,000 in a taxable brokerage account\n\nThey also have $38,000 in a high-yield savings account for emergencies. Their monthly expenses hover around $4,200. Jim is planning to delay Social Security until age 67 to lock in a higher benefit, but until then, the couple has to rely on what they've saved.\n\nThe problem: withdrawing from the wrong account too early\u2014or in the wrong order\u2014could lead to thousands in unnecessary taxes over time. Jim knows that once he turns 73, required minimum distributions, or RMDs, will force him to pull from his tax-deferred 401(k) whether he wants to or not. That worries him, especially if it pushes him into a higher tax bracket later.\n\nCarla, who took time off to raise their children and only began contributing to a Roth in her 50s, doesn't have much in retirement savings herself. Jim always figured his plan would be enough for both of them.\n\nThe Classic Debate: Taxable, Then Tax-Deferred?\n\nFinancial planners often promote the \"classic\" withdrawal order:\n\nTaxable brokerage accounts Tax-deferred accounts like traditional 401(k)s or IRAs Tax-free Roth accounts last, to let them grow as long as possible\n\nThe idea is to tap into funds with the lowest tax consequence first, preserving the tax-advantaged growth of the others. But that assumes you're not planning Roth conversions or trying to qualify for health insurance subsidies.\n\nJim's in a gray zone. With no Social Security yet and a low current income, his effective tax rate is unusually low. That's where the Roth conversion crowd chimes in.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets \u2014 Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nWhat If Jim Did Roth Conversions?\n\nSome advisors argue that early retirement\u2014especially before RMDs or Social Security\u2014can be the perfect time to do small Roth conversions, pulling money from the 401(k) at low tax rates and converting it into a Roth to avoid higher taxes later.\n\nFinancial expert Suze Orman has even called not taking advantage of a Roth conversion one of her \"biggest money mistakes,\" saying she missed a key chance to let her savings grow tax-free.\n\nBut that strategy means paying taxes now\u2014and Jim isn't sure he's emotionally ready to see his balance drop just to save on future taxes.\n\nThe ACA Wildcard\n\nIf Carla retires in two years, they'll need to buy health insurance on the marketplace. Here's where things get tricky: any extra income, even from a 401(k) withdrawal, could disqualify them from getting Affordable Care Act subsidies, costing them thousands per year in premiums.\n\nIf Jim relies too heavily on his 401(k) for the next few years, he might unknowingly price himself out of affordable health insurance.\n\nWhat If He Just Stuck to the Brokerage Account?\n\nLet's say Jim pulls $50,000 a year from the brokerage account for now. Because it's mostly long-term capital gains, he could pay very little in taxes\u2014maybe even zero if his taxable income stays low. This would preserve his Roth and 401(k) balances while avoiding ACA traps.\n\nBut that also means selling investments, giving up long-term compounding, and potentially triggering capital gains. Plus, it's not a permanent solution\u2014he'll still need to deal with the 401(k) eventually.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate\u2014Get Institutional Access Yourself\n\nAnd If He Starts With the 401(k)?\n\nIf Jim pulled from his 401(k) instead\u2014say, $50,000 this year\u2014that money would be taxed as ordinary income. He'd stay in the 12% federal bracket, but every withdrawal raises his taxable income, making future ACA subsidies harder to qualify for.\n\nThe Roth Temptation\n\nThen there's the Roth IRA, sitting untouched. It's tax-free. It's flexible. It's tempting. But draining it now could mean giving up one of the most powerful tools for tax-free compounding and inheritance.\n\nExperts often advise retirees to save Roths for last\u2014or at least for unexpected expenses that would otherwise trigger a tax hit.\n\nNo One-Size-Fits-All Plan\n\nIn Jim's case, there's no perfect answer. He could prioritize the brokerage account and sprinkle in small Roth conversions from his 401(k) while he's in a low bracket. He could delay drawing from the Roth until much later. Or he could split his withdrawals across all three to smooth out taxes over time.\n\nIt's not about finding the right account to draw from. It's about managing the long-term tax impact, avoiding benefit cliffs, and maintaining flexibility in a world full of unknowns.\n\nBut Jim's question isn't unusual\u2014and he's not the only retiree looking at a pile of savings and wondering, Now what?\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Meta Platforms is the cheapest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks on a forward earnings basis, and it has been growing quickly. Alphabet is one of the best-positioned AI stocks. 10 stocks we like better than Amazon \u203a\n\nBillionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller was busy scooping up a trio of \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in the third quarter, adding positions in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). However, the former hedge fund manager (who now just manages his own money) wasn't going all-in on big tech, as he exited his positions in Microsoft and Broadcom.\n\nLet's look at what Druckenmiller might like about these three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, and consider whether retail investors should follow him into these names.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nDruckenmiller's biggest individual stock purchase in the third quarter was Amazon. Despite its size, Amazon has been a low-key winner in the AI arena. While it's best known for its e-commerce operations, it is the company's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), that is actually its largest source of profits. That unit is also its fastest-growing, with revenue growth accelerating to 20% in Q3.\n\nWhile AWS' growth has trailed peers, it's spending big and starting to gain momentum. Its huge Project Rainer, which uses its custom AI chips to support Anthropic, is just starting to ramp up. Additionally, AWS recently signed a seven-year, $38 billion deal with OpenAI.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is increasing its use of AI and robots internally to make its e-commerce operations more efficient. It's also using AI in its high-gross-margin ad business to improve targeting and campaign creativity. This is leading to strong operating leverage.\n\nWith the stock trading at a P/E ratio below the levels of traditional retailers like Costco Wholesale and Walmart, it's easy to see why Druckenmiller likes Amazon's stock.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is also benefiting from AI. Like Amazon, it's using AI to help advertisers on its platforms create better campaigns and improve user targeting. It's also using AI to enhance its recommendation algorithm, which is feeding users more relevant content and keeping them engaged with its apps longer. Combined, this helped drive 26% growth in revenue last quarter, as it saw a 14% jump in ad impressions and a 10% increase in average price per ad.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta has nice opportunities in front of it with WhatsApp and Threads. It's just starting to serve ads on both platforms, so there is a long potential runway for revenue growth. WhatsApp has more than 3 billion users, and while most are in international markets, this is still a big opportunity. At the same time, it continues to build out Threads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is also the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 19.5 times 2026 analyst estimates.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is arguably one of the companies that's best positioned to profit from AI. Its cloud business is growing swiftly, with revenue soaring 34% and operating income skyrocketing 89% last quarter. Moreover, it's the cloud company with the most complete tech stack, and with its pending acquisition of cloud security company Wiz, the best could still be ahead.\n\nAlphabet can supply its customers with end-to-end solutions. Its Gemini foundational large language model (LLM) is among the best currently on the market, and Alphabet is far ahead of its rivals with custom AI chips. It began developing its tensor processing units (TPUs) more than a decade ago, and is now on the seventh generation of those specialized AI accelerators. This gives its AI data centers advantages in performance, efficiency, and cost that will only become more important in the coming years.\n\nMeanwhile, its search business is also benefiting from AI, which is helping drive growth in queries. This could also be seen last quarter as its search revenue growth accelerated to 15%. The company has huge distribution and data advantages, which create a wide moat, even as search and AI chatbots meld into one service. Meanwhile, its YouTube streaming business is seeing robust growth (15% in Q3), and it has attractive speculative bets that could pay off handsomely in the long term with its Waymo robotaxi business and its quantum computing unit.\n\nTrading at a forward P/E of around 25 times 2026 analysts' estimates, Alphabet looks attractively priced, given the long-term opportunities in front of it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Combined, this helped drive 26% growth in revenue last quarter, as it saw a 14% jump in ad impressions and a 10% increase in average price per ad.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta has nice opportunities in front of it with WhatsApp and Threads. It's just starting to serve ads on both platforms, so there is a long potential runway for revenue growth. WhatsApp has more than 3 billion users, and while most are in international markets, this is still a big opportunity. At the same time, it continues to build out Threads.\n\nMeta is also the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 19.5 times 2026 analyst estimates.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is arguably one of the companies that's best positioned to profit from AI. Its cloud business is growing swiftly, with revenue soaring 34% and operating income skyrocketing 89% last quarter. Moreover, it's the cloud company with the most complete tech stack, and with its pending acquisition of cloud security company Wiz, the best could still be ahead.\n\nAlphabet can supply its customers with end-to-end solutions. Its Gemini foundational large language model (LLM) is among the best currently on the market, and Alphabet is far ahead of its rivals with custom AI chips. It began developing its tensor processing units (TPUs) more than a decade ago, and is now on the seventh generation of those specialized AI accelerators. This gives its AI data centers advantages in performance, efficiency, and cost that will only become more important in the coming years.\n\nMeanwhile, its search business is also benefiting from AI, which is helping drive growth in queries. This could also be seen last quarter as its search revenue growth accelerated to 15%. The company has huge distribution and data advantages, which create a wide moat, even as search and AI chatbots meld into one service. Meanwhile, its YouTube streaming business is seeing robust growth (15% in Q3), and it has attractive speculative bets that could pay off handsomely in the long term with its Waymo robotaxi business and its quantum computing unit.\n\nTrading at a forward P/E of around 25 times 2026 analysts' estimates, Alphabet looks attractively priced, given the long-term opportunities in front of it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.
