Its Founders Say They Bootstrapped Their Success", "content": "Twin sisters Taylor Capuano and Casey Sarai found themselves at a crossroads in their careers in 2022. Instead of taking a more traditional route, the women elected to start their own company, Cakes Body, which now does millions in sales each year.\n\nThree years ago, Capuano was a marketing manager at the clothing brand Life Is Good and had just welcomed her first child. Stepping into motherhood left her desiring more flexibility in her working life, she told CNBC. Meanwhile, Sarai was a marketing manager at Pernod Ricard and was struggling with pandemic-era layoffs that had made her job much more difficult.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon \u2014 Invest at $0.86/Share Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nBoth women \"desperately needed a path\" forward, Capuano told the outlet. So they decided to take a gamble on starting their own business, feeling that \"there was really nothing to lose.\"\n\nCakes Body's early success\n\nThe pair spent some time brainstorming pain points in their own lives and potential solutions before settling on the idea of producing a new type of silicone nipple cover, they told CNBC. Unlike other silicone nipple covers on the market, theirs would be larger, made of a higher quality silicone that tapered at the edges, and would stick to skin without any potentially irritating adhesive.\n\nOnce they had settled on a prototype they liked, Capuano and Sarai each took $5,000 from their personal savings accounts to invest in the business. They spent the money on 500 units, as well as an online store and social media advertisements.\n\nTrending: Bill Gates Says Climate Change \u2018Needs to Be Solved' \u2014 This Award-Winning Building Material Is Tackling It Head-On\n\nFive months after launch, Cakes Body had its first viral moment when a TikTok hit 1 million views. The viral video helped the sisters sell out their initial stock.\n\n\"It was very exciting and it gave [us] the first glimmer of hope,\" Capuano told CNBC. Still, the sisters were nervous about quitting their full-time jobs, worried that the viral moment wouldn't be sustained. It would take several more rounds of sold-out stock before they both decided to take the plunge, making Cakes Body their full-time gigs.\n\nThe Shark Tank effect\n\nBy the end of their first full year in business, Cakes Body topped $1 million in revenue, a spokesman for the company told CNBC. But the sisters weren't satisfied with that level of success.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo, in 2023, they took their nipple covers to \"Shark Tank,\" where they made a deal with Skims and Good American co-founder Emma Grede. The deal, which saw Grede invest $30,000 in exchange for 10% of the company, valued Cakes Body at $3 million.\n\nGrede's investment is currently the only outside money the company has accepted. \"We just knew: \u2018This is a simple solution that is helping us. I wonder if other people will find it useful,' Capuano told CNBC about the sister's decision to bootstrap their growth instead of taking on outside funding.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

Capuano now works full-time as the company's chief creative officer, and Saria is its CEO.\n\nThe sisters told CNBC that their plans for the future include international expansion and continued growth in the brick-and-mortar space. In August, the company launched in Ulta(NASDAQ:ULTA) and is now sold in 1,000 stores around the country.\n\nDespite their initial fears that Cakes Body's success would be fleeting, they encourage others who have a similar dream to take the plunge.\n\n\"There is a moment where you have to take a leap of faith of either ordering the inventory or putting out the first Instagram post,\" Capuano told CNBC. As long as you're product is solving a problem in a market that has room for financial growth, it\u2019s worth plunging ahead, she added.\n\nRead Next: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets \u2014 Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

The November 18 release of Gemini 3 Pro with its new Deep Think reasoning mode has impressed analysts with benchmarks and pricing that outperformed expectations, especially compared to Microsoft\u2019s recent Ignite conference and ChatGPT 5\u2019s August release.\n\nGemini 3 topped benchmarks for coding, tool use, math, science, and multimodal reasoning. The model is immediately available across Google\u2019s ecosystem and third-party platforms like GitHub and Replit, potentially helping Google\u2019s profitable API business.\n\nGoogle\u2019s custom TPU chip, now in its seventh generation, has become a significant advantage. Reitzes notes that Gemini 3 was trained primarily on Google TPUs, giving Alphabet a price advantage. Outside of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, the TPU is considered the most proven AI chip with the most tangible momentum.\n\nThis progress has created concerns for OpenAI, with CEO Sam Altman acknowledging in an internal memo that Google\u2019s advances could create \"temporary economic headwinds.\" This admission, combined with reports of slower user growth, has impacted investor confidence in OpenAI and affected stocks like Oracle, AMD, Microsoft, CoreWeave, Broadcom, and Nvidia.\n\nAMD and Oracle appear most exposed to OpenAI\u2019s success. AMD has fallen 23% from its October high, while Oracle is down 39% from its September peak. AMD\u2019s deal with OpenAI involves adding 6GW of capacity starting in the second half of 2026, while Oracle has included a $300 billion deal with OpenAI in its RPO backlog.\n\nFor investors seeking safer options amid AI volatility, Reitzes suggests Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Apple is described as a \"toll road\" to mobile AI that can benefit regardless of which company ultimately dominates the AI race. The analyst maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a $345 price target.\n\nIBM offers stability through its mainframe cycle and infrastructure software, with promising developments in quantum computing. Cisco is gaining ground selling optics to hyperscalers for AI while benefiting from a campus switching cycle in enterprise.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) faces challenges from Google\u2019s AI image generation and editing tools, which could potentially draw users away from Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud ecosystem despite their partnership to integrate Gemini 3.\n\nRelated articles\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini 3 advances shake up AI competitive landscape\n\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\n\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-gemini-3-advances-shake-140624037.html", "symbols": ["1GOOG.MI", "1GOOGL.MI", "AAPL.US", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEC.F", "ADBE.US", "AMD.US", "CSCO.US", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.BA"], "tags": ["AI", "EARNINGS", "PRICE TARGET", "PRICE-TARGET", "SEMICONDUCTORS", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.022, "neu": 0.832, "pos": 0.147}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T13:58:47+00:00", "title": "OpenAI could need $207B in financing by 2030 amid compute capacity pledges: HSBC", "content": "[Machine Learning.

One unknown parameter is the flexibility that OpenAI may have to adjust its commitment vs effective demand or financial capacity. Capital injections, debt issuance, or higher revenue than in our model would help closing the funding gap,\" said Cote-Colisson and his team.\n\nThe analysts noted that an AI megacycle is ahead. The analysts said that OpenAI\u2019s forecast of $1.4T of compute costs over eight years adds to investor nervousness about associated returns (given estimated revenue of $12.5B in 2025), not only for OpenAI but for the interlaced AI chain.\n\n\"Yet as MSFT\u2019s CEO put it, AI model companies, infrastructure owners, and chipmakers going to market together is helping customers to realize AI\u2019s value. We look at productivity-gain upside that can be significant even not considering Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The most exposed partners to OpenAI success or failure under our coverage are Oracle (ORCL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL]), Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, and AMD (AMD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD]), and so is SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFTBY]) (OTCPK:SFTBF [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFTBF]),\" said Cote-Colisson and his team.\n\nMORE ON MICROSOFT AND OPENAI\n\n \t* Microsoft's AI And Azure Dominance Justifies A Premium 'Buy' Rating [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846799-microsoft-ai-and-azure-dominance-justifies-a-premium-buy-rating]\n \t* Microsoft: I'm Waiting For $450 Entry (Downgrade, Technical Analysis) [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846676-microsoft-im-waiting-for-450-entry-downgrade-technical-analysis]\n \t* Microsoft Slips As Technical Pressure Outweighs New Saudi Cloud Partnership [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846184-microsoft-slips-technical-pressure-outweighs-new-saudi-cloud-partnership]\n \t* Qwen app hits 10 million downloads in a week as Alibaba pushes ChatGPT rival [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525182-qwen-app-hits-10-million-downloads-in-a-week-as-alibaba-pushes-chatgpt-rival]\n \t* Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has a 'Holy S---' AI moment [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525172-salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-has-a-holy-s-ai-moment]\n\n ", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525336-openai-could-need-207b-in-financing-by-2030-amid-compute-capacity-pledges-hsbc?utm_source=feed_news_all&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;feed_item_type=news", "symbols": ["AMD.US", "AMZN.US", "ANTHRO.US", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "HSBC.US", "MSFT.US", "NVDA.US", "OPENAI.US", "ORCL.US"], "tags": ["AI", "CLOUD-COMPUTING", "INFRASTRUCTURE", "SEMICONDUCTORS", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.947, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.886, "pos": 0.081}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T13:58:36+00:00", "title": "Bank of America Securities Reiterates a Buy on \u200bAlphabet Inc.

In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2025.\n\nIn its third-quarter 2025 investor letter, Loomis Sayles Global Growth Fund highlighted stocks such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was 11.01%, and its shares gained 76.86% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On November 21, 2025, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $299.65 per share, with a market capitalization of $3.617 trillion.\n\nLoomis Sayles Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its third quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a holding company that owns a collection of businesses, the largest and most important of which by far is Google. Google is the global leader in online search and advertising and also offers cloud solutions to businesses and consumers globally, with a goal of organizing the world\u2019s information and making it universally accessible and useful. Google dominates the US and global traditional search market with a greater than 80% share of search volumes. As a function of seeing more searches, Google is able to provide better search results, resulting in a higher customer conversion rate for advertisers and enabling Google to capture a leading share of search revenue. Google\u2019s large network of consumers, advertisers, and publishers is a powerful business ecosystem as third-party participants such as marketing affiliates and independent software vendors add value to the user experience. As a result, we believe consumers get their best and most relevant search results and advertisers get the best returns on their advertising dollars. Such a robust ecosystem attracts increasing numbers of participants and thereby creates a virtuous cycle for a sustainable business model and long-term growth. In its emerging cloud business, we estimate that Google captures less than 10% market share of the global market for public cloud services. We believe Google remains one of the few global companies that has the scale, research and development (R&D), and technical talent to effectively compete in this market over the long term. Non-Google businesses comprise less than 1% of Alphabet revenues and are held in the company\u2019s Other Bets segment.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAlphabet Inc.

It shapes how we design model architectures, develop algorithms for training and inference, and choose the hardware with the best price-performance to deliver frontier intelligence to our customers,\" said Krithik Puthalath, CEO of Zyphra. \"ZAYA1 reflects this philosophy and we are thrilled to be the first company to demonstrate large-scale training on an AMD platform. Our results highlight the power of co-designing model architectures with silicon and systems, and we're excited to deepen our collaboration with AMD and IBM as we build the next generation of advanced multimodal foundation models.\"\n\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the foundational architecture for modern, frontier AI systems, using specialized expert networks that activate dynamically to deliver greater efficiency, scalability, and reasoning performance than traditional dense architectures. This paradigm shift defines today's leading frontier models including GPT-5, Claude-4.5 DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi2 all of which leverage MoE designs to expand capability while optimizing compute utilization. ZAYA1 represents the first large-scale pretraining of an MoE model on an AMD platform, demonstrating that the AMD AI ecosystem is ready to power frontier-class AI development end-to-end.\n\nZyphra co-designed ZAYA1 around AMD silicon, introducing innovations such as an advanced routing architecture, Compressed Convolutional Attention (CCA), and lightweight residual scaling to achieve higher training throughput and more efficient inference through improved expert utilization.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Zyphra's work with AMD and IBM demonstrates how an open platform built on AMD Instinct GPUs and AMD Pensando networking can deliver breakthrough performance and efficiency for large-scale AI,\" said Philip Guido, EVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AMD. \"This milestone underscores how innovative AMD hardware and software solutions are enabling the next wave of frontier AI development with industry leaders.\"\n\nBuilding on prior collaborative work and to achieve this milestone, Zyphra collaborated closely with AMD and IBM to design and deploy a large-scale training cluster powered by AMD Instinct GPUs with AMD Pensando networking (ethernet) interconnect. The jointly engineered AMD and IBM cluster announced earlier this quarter, combines AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs with IBM Cloud's high-performance fabric and storage architecture providing the foundation for ZAYA1's large-scale pretraining.\n\n\"As AI creates opportunities for enterprises to innovate, foundation models are key to unlocking accelerated development, efficiency and productivity,\" said Alan Peacock, GM of IBM Cloud. \"We are proud to deliver IBM's scalable AI infrastructure as the foundation for ZAYA1's large-scale model and are excited to continue collaborating with AMD on AI model development across our mutual clients.\"\n\nThe joint collaboration demonstrates how Zyphra's advanced AI research and optimized software stack, combined with the AMD platform powered by IBM's infrastructure through IBM Cloud can deliver the performance needed for reliable frontier-scale AI model development.\n\nFor more information please reference the technical report on arXiv, the Zyphra technical blog post, and AMD blog post.\n\nAbout Zyphra\n\nZyphra is a full-stack, open-source superintelligence company based in San Francisco on a mission to build human-aligned AGI.\n\nZyphra's core research thesis toward general superintelligence is focused on developing next-generation multimodal architectures for long-context reasoning, long-term memory, and continual learning.\n\nThe company is building two products:\n\nZyphra Inference Cloud - an API inference platform for Zyphra's multimodal models (language, audio and vision) and other leading open-source models.\n\nMaia - an intelligent assistant for teams that enhances collaboration by bringing search, communication, and productivity tools together in one platform.\n\nZyphra's team is committed to democratizing advanced AI systems, exploring novel architectures at the frontier of silicon performance, and advancing the scientific understanding of powerful models through open source and open science.

There, Walmart is optimistic too.\n\n\"Holiday is off to a pretty good start,\" Rainey said on the company's earnings call. \"Back-to-school tends to be an early indicator for how that goes, Halloween, likewise for Thanksgiving, and everything that we've seen so far makes us optimistic and encouraged about customers and members leaning into the seasonal events and holiday shopping period.\" Thu, November 20, 2025 at 12:41 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWalmart earnings surpass estimates as retailer lifts guidance\n\nYahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports:\n\nRead more here.

However, these huge complexes, which the company owns or operates through long-term leases, do not account for its full footprint. AWS also has server racks in hundreds of so-called colocation facilities, renting space that as of last year provided about a fifth of the computing power at Amazon\u2019s disposal, the report added [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-24/amazon-data-center-tally-tops-900-amid-ai-frenzy-documents-show?srnd=phx-technology].\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.\n\nKnown as \u201ccolos\u201d in the industry, the rented data centers are usually subdivided among different clients. The AWS presence in such facilities ranges from a few server racks in a dedicated room to most or all of massive buildings in places such as Frankfurt and Tokyo, according to the report.\n\nAWS does not disclose the places of individual data centers for security reasons and to keep operational details out of the hands of rivals. The documents indicate Amazon\u2019s cloud computing operations at a time when investors are interested to know if AWS has enough capacity to meet the large computing demands for AI. They also suggest that AWS is one of the world\u2019s largest renters of colo space, indicating that it has the flexibility to offer customers several services worldwide, the report noted.\n\nAs of early 2024, AWS was depending on over 440 colocation data centers. The company also operated from over 220 additional rented \u201cedge\u201d locations, which provide access points to Amazon\u2019s network near major metropolitan areas, often inside telecommunications facilities operated by third parties, the report added.\n\nAmazon's presence at some of these locations is designed to give customers the ability to swiftly route data from their own servers or those of other cloud providers to Amazon\u2019s own infrastructure, as per the report.\n\nAWS spokesperson Aisha Johnson said to the news outlet that Amazon\u2019s approach to data centers \u201cbalances ownership with flexibility,\u201d and was driven by rising demand for AWS services.\n\n\u201cWhile we own and operate the majority of our data centers, we strategically leverage third-party options when they provide additional capacity or geographic reach,\u201d Johnson noted. \u201cThis long-term planning approach allows us to make precise decisions that align with our customers\u2019 evolving requirements.\u201d\n\nAWS is the world\u2019s largest provider of rented computing power, but its leadership position is being challenged by Microsoft (MSFT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT]) and Alphabet's (GOOG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG]) (GOOGL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL]) Google, which have seen their sales soar alongside the launch of AI services.\n\nData center tracker Baxtel puts Amazon\u2019s data center numbers at 449 across 49 markets. Another provider DC Byte places AWS footprint at 364 facilities in 33 countries. Researchers note that tracking Amazon\u2019s full footprint, including colos, is not possible because the agreements between AWS and its landlords are generally private, the report added.\n\nAmazon collaborates with at least 180 different entities in its colocation arrangements, ranging from colo data center operator Equinix to Japanese telecommunications company NTT, and Markley, which operates a data center in Boston, the report noted.\n\nEnvironmental groups and consumer advocates warn that the rapid rate of data center buildout by companies is straining electricity grids and prolonging the life of fossil-fueled power plants.\n\nJohnson noted that other industries, not just data centers, are contributing to rising energy demand, and that the company is investing billions of dollars in carbon-free energy projects, including renewables and nuclear power. \u201cThese investments are designed to add new clean energy to the grid \u2014 helping to meet growing demand while reducing reliance on fossil fuels over time.\" Johnson added.\n\nMORE ON AMAZON\n\n \t* Amazon: Scoop Up This Bargain Hiding In Plain Sight Now [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846170-amazon-scoop-up-bargain-hiding-in-plain-sight-now]\n \t* Amazon: OpenAI Deal Is A Game Changer [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846091-amazon-openai-deal-is-a-game-changer]\n \t* Amazon: Anthropic X Microsoft Deal Changes Nothing [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845632-amazon-anthropic-x-microsoft-deal-changes-nothing]\n \t* SA Asks: Is Tesla losing the robotaxi race to commercialization?

IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave are unprofitable, and their expenses are rising. Buying these stocks now means you're paying a premium for an unproven market. 10 stocks we like better than IonQ \u203a\n\nQuantum computing has quickly become one of the most popular technologies to invest in after artificial intelligence. Just take a look at the share price gains of some of the biggest names in the industry -- IonQ(NYSE: IONQ), Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), and D-Wave (NYSE: QBTS), which are up 89%, 1,500%, and 1,800% over the past year, respectively.\n\nThere's good reason for some of the optimism. Quantum computing will eventually aid scientists in discovering new drugs, enhancing climate science, developing new materials, and refining artificial intelligence models. Estimates from BCG suggest that the potential economic value of quantum computing could reach $850 billion by 2040.\n\nHowever, there's also a good reason to be a bit skeptical. With massive run-ups like these quantum computing stocks are experiencing -- though IonQ's is negligible in comparison -- it's a good time to remember that quantum computing is still in its very early stages. Here are two hurdles the industry needs to overcome before people start investing in quantum computing stocks.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Quantum computers still get things wrong -- a lot\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles with quantum computers is that their processing is so complex that they have high error rates. Progress is being made on this front, and most quantum computing companies say that their systems are helping to reduce error rates.\n\nNonetheless, for the technology to be truly transformative, error rates will need to be significantly lower than they are now. To help achieve this, some tech leaders, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, believe that combining traditional supercomputers with quantum computers is the way forward.\n\nThe idea is that traditional supercomputers will handle the computing tasks in which they excel, which helps reduce errors. At the same time, quantum computers take on larger modeling tasks that even supercomputers can't handle. IonQ and Rigetti are already collaborating with Nvidia on the hybrid concept.\n\nStill, it could be years before error rates are low enough to get some of the biggest benefits from quantum computers. Even Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), which released a new quantum computing processor called Willow last year, has hinted that these systems aren't really ready for prime time yet. CEO Sundar Pichai said earlier this year:\"Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications.\"\n\nLeer m\u00e1s\n\nIn other words, quantum computing is getting there, but it's not quite there yet.\n\n2. Revenue is very low, while losses and spending are high\n\nQuantum computing is still a speculative investment by almost any measure. One of the primary reasons this matters to investors is that the high-flying stocks in the industry typically have minimal revenue and are largely unprofitable. Here's a quick look at the revenue, losses, and operating expenses for IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave in the most recent quarter.\n\nCompany Q3 Revenue Q3 Operating Expenses Q3 Net Loss IonQ $39.9 million $208 million ($1.1 billion) Rigetti $1.9 million $20.9 million ($201 million) D-Wave $3.7 million $30.4 million ($140 million)\n\nData source: IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave.\n\nAs you can see, all these companies have negligible sales compared to their losses. Their operating expenses are sizable as the companies spend money to run their business and invest in technology. While being unprofitable isn't unusual for growth companies, I believe it's particularly concerning for shareholders of these quantum computing stocks.\n\nConsider that as their share prices have skyrocketed, their valuations have surged to dizzying levels. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for IonQ is 148, Rigetti's is 964,, and D-Wave's is 282. That's compared to the tech industry's average P/S ratio of about 9.\n\nThat's a recipe for a potentially massive pullback from these stocks if the companies fail to generate meaningful sales and reach profitability. The market is already starting to become impatient with a potential AI bubble, but at least many artificial intelligence companies have profits to support their share price gains.\n\nI don't think quantum computing will be a bust in the long term, but investors certainly seem to be overly optimistic about IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave. These companies still have a long way to go before they become profitable, and there's no guarantee they'll ever reach that goal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

It was too late to launch its own generative AI model, and its initial launch also fell flat on its face. Eventually, Alphabet got its model right, and Gemini is one of the leading AI models on the marketplace. It has been seamlessly integrated into the Google Search engine through AI overviews, which provide a generative AI-powered summary of each search result. This bridges the gap between new-age AI and traditional search, cementing Google's place as the front page of the internet.\n\nAlphabet also received positive news during the quarter regarding its business practices. Alphabet was accused of running an illegal monopoly in its search and advertising businesses. While it was found guilty of these practices, the judge presiding over its case thought the Justice Department's calls to break up Alphabet were too strong. So, it forced Alphabet to make some concessions, but the company mostly survived the court case unscathed.\n\nNews of Alphabet escaping a breakup sent the stock soaring and ignited a massive run-up in the stock.GOOGL data by YCharts\n\nDepending on when these billionaires purchased the stock, they could be up almost 50% on their investment already. That's a monstrous return over the span of five months, especially for a tech behemoth like Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe question is, after a huge run like that, is Alphabet still a buy now?\n\nAlphabet is still cheap compared to its peers\n\nWith all of the question marks surrounding Alphabet cleared, the market is free to value Alphabet for the business it truly is. During Q3, Alphabet grew revenue at a 16% year-over-year pace and increased its diluted earnings per share (EPS) by 35% year over year. Few tech stocks outside of Nvidia are delivering strong growth like that, so it's safe to say that Alphabet deserves to have a bit of a premium to that market and its peers.\n\nAt about 26 times next year's earnings, Alphabet is certainly valued at that level.GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts\n\nAlphabet is no longer the bargain stock it was just a few months ago, and now has a premium valuation like its big tech peers. However, I think Alphabet is well positioned to continue capitalizing on current market conditions through strong growth and an excellent AI strategy. Alphabet also has a thriving cloud computing business and quantum computing endeavors.\n\nAlthough the upside isn't as high as it once was, I still think Alphabet has the growth rates and catalysts to beat the market over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Friday's stock trading will close at 1 p.m.\n\nThough trading hours will be regular on Wednesday, trading volumes will be seriously light because many traders and investors will depart early from their computer screens to get ahead of the holiday traffic, whether by land, sea or, most importantly, air.\n\nAnd maybe they'll be thankful just for a break. The past week was traumatic for many people watching their investments. Here's how key markets ended:\n\nStandard & Poor's 500 Index. Up 1% on Friday, down nearly 2% on the week and down 3.4% in November. Nasdaq Composite Index. Up 0.9%% on Friday, down 2.7% on the week and down 6.1% in November. Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Down 2.1% on Friday, down 10.3% on the week and down 20.5% so far in November.\n\nThe question many investors may have ked is: Where in the heck did this turmoil come from? Especially after Nvidia, the rockstar of semiconductors and world's most valuable company, reported blowout earnings after Wednesday's close. The shares opened higher on Thursday and then slid backward, taking the entire stock market with it until, finally, the Friday rally started a rally started \u2014 and held.\n\nRelated: T. Rowe Price insists investors will find 2026 less stressful\n\nStock prices are largely determined by corporate revenue and earnings and the state of the economy. The third quarter results have proved to be quite robust. U.S. corporate revenues are tracking to show an increase of 8.4% for the quarter, according to FactSet, potentially the best quarter since the third quarter of 2022, when revenues jumped 11%.\n\nBut the selling pressure was set off because many analysts, money managers and investors began to think stocks were getting way ahead of themselves. The S&P 500 is up nearly 37% since the bottom of the Trump Tariff panic in early April. The Nasdaq is up 51% since then. Google-parent Alphabet is nearly 110%. Nvidia is up 107%.\n\nA blunter fear is that stocks are in bubble territory and ready \u2014 or near ready \u2014 to tumble. Or maybe not.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRay Dalio, one of the great money managers, thinks markets are in bubble territory, but probably not ready to sell. Someone must have to unload stocks for the bubble to break. That's not happening, he said on a CNBC interview on Thursday as Nvidia was rising.\n\nBitcoin was overbought for most of the spring and summer, and investors, who understood the asset's history of volatility, started to sell after its early October peak. This past week's 10.3% slump caused its relative strength index to drop below 30 for most of the last week, a traditional signal of an asset may be oversold.\n\nIt bounced up after hitting 25 on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, many Americans are unhappy. They don't like rising retail prices, sky-high housing costs, beloved local eateries disappearing seemingly overnight, battles over healthcare and divided politics and waves of large layoffs.

Bond buyers are starting to worry about being compensated for the risks of a bubble in the sector, given recent turmoil in tech stocks.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is that a flood of data center financing could cause supply indigestion, particularly in dollars, but with euro markets also absorbing part of the funding needs,\u201d said JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Matthew Bailey.\n\nInvestors are now questioning whether these massive investments in artificial intelligence will pay off. There are no broad signs of panic in credit, with many of the sales so far having come from top-tier names.\n\nAlphabet raised $17.5 billion in the US and \u20ac6.5 billion ($7.5 billion) in Europe, the second-largest corporate deal in the region this year, while Meta sold $30 billion and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) did $18 billion. Demand was huge, with Meta getting a record peak orderbook of $125 billion.\n\nSupply Glut\n\nHedge fund Man Group Plc noted that high-yield firms are also issuing, including former bitcoin miners. These companies\u2019 data center plans come with \u201caggressive deadlines\u201d and a heavy reliance on the supporting lease contracts, it said in a blog post titled \u201cWhy Bond Investors Aren\u2019t Totally Buying the AI Hype.\u201d\n\n\u201cA glut of supply of lower quality names in the AI space might be too much for markets to stomach,\u201d Man Group\u2019s Jon Lahraoui and Hugo Richardson wrote. \u201cThe hyperscaler frenzy continues, but we remain watchful of future AI slop,\u201d they added.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Bailey estimates that Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, (META) Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) alone have capital expenditure needs of around $570 billion for 2026, up from $125 billion back in 2021. Meanwhile UBS Group AG sees total tech debt supply at over $900 billion next year.\n\nLeer m\u00e1s\n\nThe fact that the big players have strong balance sheets and significant capacity to take on debt means they can offer new issue premiums to appeal to investors that other borrowers may be forced to match, Morgan Stanley analysts warned.\n\n\u201cTech issuers have also shown themselves to be less price-sensitive given the strategic importance of these projects \u2014 a dynamic that can still reprice the broader market,\u201d the US bank said in its recent Global Insights outlook report. \u201cLarge issuers who are less sensitive to price is a new dynamic credit markets haven\u2019t contended with for a long time.\u201d\n\nStill Underinvested\n\nSpreads in the corporate bond market have been mostly range bound this year after recovering from the blow out on April\u2019s US tariff announcements. Driving this has been the huge swathes of cash flowing into the asset class, chasing yields at high levels compared to recent years.\n\nFor European investment-grade investors, the rise in issuance from Big Tech and its diversification for the euro market gives an opportunity for exposure that is currently still underrepresented, according to Marco Stoeckle, head of credit strategy at Commerzbank AG.\n\n\u201cEuro investors are essentially underinvested in high quality US tech issuers,\u201d he said. \u201cDemand therefore should not be the main problem as long as credit profiles remain on the right track.\u201d\n\nMonetization Risk\n\nEven with record overall bond supply in Europe this year, it hasn\u2019t been enough to satiate this demand. Next year, global investment-grade bond issuance is seen rising by 3% in euros and 13% in dollars, skewed toward non-financial companies and AI-related spending from tech firms and utilities, HSBC Holdings Plc wrote in its market outlook.\n\nFinancing AI capex is becoming a defining feature of the fixed income world, according to Brandywine Global Investment Managment portfolio manager Tracy Chen. While she likes data center asset-backed securities for stable credit fundamentals and relative insulation from any consumer fragility, she highlighted future monetization risk, or the potential to generate enough revenues.\n\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology initiative this year released a report indicating that 95% of organizations are getting zero return from generative AI projects. Investors and lenders are already hedging their bets by trading more derivatives that offer payouts if individual tech companies default on their debt.\n\n\u201cRefinancing risk and the maturity wall will become more acute if the macro market destabilizes,\u201d Chen said.

Google owner Alphabet sold $25 billion in bonds,\u200c Meta $30 billion, Oracle $18 billion and Amazon, the most recent, $15 billion.\n\nSeveral analysts forecast higher amounts of hyperscaler debt issuance next year as big tech firms race to finance AI-ready data centers. High-grade bond markets may need to absorb $1.5 trillion of AI data center bond sales over the next five years, with that type of debt potentially representing \u2060over 20% of the investment-grade \u200cbond market by 2030, J.P. Morgan analysts estimated recently.\n\n\"The potential for this data center capacity spend to come to the investment-grade market means you could have a significant re-levering \u200din a new sector, and it could become a material risk to the high-grade market,\" said Robert Cohen, director of global developed credit at DoubleLine, a bond-focused investment firm managing $90 billion in assets.\n\n\"You've got a large new sector that'\u200bs clearly unproven, and that would change the risk profile of investment-grade credit quite substantially from where it is \u200ctoday, that's my concern,\" he said in an interview.\n\nRising debt at tech companies has added a new layer of concern to broader financial markets that, despite being fueled by the promise of high AI returns, remain wary that the technology has yet to deliver the profits needed to justify such large capital spending.\n\nMeanwhile, although U.S. investment-grade credit spreads remain near historic lows, they have edged wider in recent weeks, reflecting growing unease over the surge of new \u2060bond supply coming to market. Spreads widened to 86 basis points \u200bon Friday, their widest since the end of June, the ICE \u200bBofA US Corporate Index showed.\n\nThe U.S. investment-grade bond market is worth about $9.2 trillion, according to the ICE BofA US Corporate Index.\n\nCohen said the corporate bond market remained in good shape \u200ddue to several factors including a \u2060strong economy, healthy corporate balance sheets, lower interest rates than over the past few years, and expectations of an accommodative Federal Reserve going forward.\n\nBut, while not an imminent risk, he said he was \"\u2060on alert\" about bond issues from tech companies flooding the market and cautious about adding exposure to their debt.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"They are building capacity to provide \u200csupport for, ultimately, a product where the end use is not super clear,\" he said.\u200c\n\n(Reporting by Davide Barbuscia; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doubleline-wary-ai-funding-wave-110658552.html", "symbols": ["1AMZN.MI", "1FB.MI", "1GOOG.MI", "1GOOGL.MI", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEC.F", "AMZ.DU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.HM", "AMZ.MU", "AMZ1.F", "AMZN.BA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.SN", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "FB20.F", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.HM", "FB2A.MU", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX"], "tags": ["AI", "BONDS", "DEBT", "INVESTMENT-GRADE", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.945, "neg": 0.06, "neu": 0.841, "pos": 0.099}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T11:01:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Stock Pops as Musk Talks Up Its AI Chips Business.

But those sorts of enormous complexes, which the company owns or operates through long-term leases, don\u2019t account for its full footprint. The cloud unit also stashes server racks in hundreds of so-called colocation facilities, renting space that as of last year provided about a fifth of the computing power at Amazon\u2019s disposal, according to the documents.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIndia\u2019s Richest Family Powers\u00a0Push for Green Space in Mumbai San Francisco Hotels That Echoed City\u2019s Decline Sell for 75% Off Where Train\u00a0Dreams Meet Reality in Texas Despite Star Architect\u2019s Alleged Misconduct, New Harlem and Princeton Museums Shine High-Rises\u00a0Are Changing the Slovak Capital of Bratislava Beyond Recognition\n\nCalled \u201ccolos\u201d in the industry, the rented data centers are typically sub-divided among different clients. The AWS presence in such facilities ranges from a few server racks in a dedicated room to most or all of enormous buildings in places like Frankfurt and Tokyo, the documents show.An Amazon Web Services data center in Stone Ridge, Virginia, US.Photographer: Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nAWS doesn\u2019t disclose the locations of individual data centers for security reasons and to keep operational details out of the hands of competitors. The documents shine a light on Amazon\u2019s cloud computing operations at a time when investors are keen for insights into whether AWS has sufficient capacity to meet the enormous computing demands for artificial intelligence. They also show that AWS is one of the world\u2019s largest renters of colo space, suggesting it has the flexibility to offer customers a range of services around the globe.\n\n\u201cThere are big data centers everyone talks about, but the reality is there are also these smaller cloud resources that are invisible,\u201d said Nic Benders, chief technical strategist at New Relic, which helps businesses manage their technology infrastructure. \u201cThe cloud providers do not like to tell you where they are.\u201d\n\nAs of early 2024, AWS was relying on more than 440 colocation data centers. The company also operated from more than 220 additional rented \u201cedge\u201d locations, which provide access points to Amazon\u2019s network near major metropolitan areas, often inside telecommunications hubs operated by third parties. The company\u2019s presence at some of these sites is designed to give customers the ability to quickly route data from their own servers or those of other cloud providers to Amazon\u2019s own infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAWS spokesperson Aisha Johnson said Amazon\u2019s approach to data centers \u201cbalances ownership with flexibility,\u201d and was driven by rising demand for AWS services.\n\n\u201cWhile we own and operate the majority of our data centers, we strategically leverage third-party options when they provide additional capacity or geographic reach,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cThis long-term planning approach allows us to make precise decisions that align with our customers\u2019 evolving requirements.\u201d\n\nAWS is the world\u2019s largest seller of rented computing power, though that leadership position is being tested by rivals like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which have seen their sales surge alongside the rollout of AI services. Still, Amazon\u2019s cloud unit produced $33 billion in revenue in the third quarter and remains the company\u2019s most-profitable division, contributing $11.4 billion in operating income in the period.\n\nFor many people, AWS\u2019 reach became clear last month when a malfunction in a key database service knocked out web sites around the world, an episode that lasted about 15 hours before the company was able to fully restore service.\n\nAmazon has periodically offered clues to the scale of its server farm footprint. In late 2023, then-AWS chief Adam Selipsky said Amazon had three times the number of data centers of its nearest competitor. That\u2019s Microsoft, which at the time was touting a fleet of 300 buildings.\n\nBaxtel, a data center tracker, places Amazon\u2019s footprint at 449 data centers across 49 markets. DC Byte, another provider, pegs the AWS fleet at 364 facilities in 33 countries. Researchers say tracking Amazon\u2019s full footprint \u2014 including colos \u2014 is impossible because the agreements between AWS and its landlords are generally private.\n\nAll told, Amazon partners with at least 180 different entities in its colocation arrangements, the documents show, ranging from colo data center operator Equinix Inc. to Japanese telecommunications giant NTT Inc. and Markley, which operates a data center in Boston.\n\nWhen an AWS customer \u2014 from Netflix Inc. to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u2013 rents computing power from Amazon, they do so from any of 38 regions around the world. Each region is powered by at least three data centers, further dividing Amazon\u2019s network into what the company calls availability zones.\n\nAmazon\u2019s preference, industry analysts say, is to own facilities or operate them on long-term leases, particularly in the US, its most important market. After 20 years of operating data centers, the company believes it can operate the facilities more efficiently than partners. AWS owns about 24 million square feet of buildings. It leases roughly the same amount, according to the company\u2019s annual report.\n\nBut Amazon also taps into space from third parties, especially when setting up shop in new areas or trying to quickly respond to changes in demand. The company has been racing in recent years to keep up with rising use of its services, both to support businesses migrating their software to Amazon\u2019s servers and meet new demand to train and power AI services. In China, local laws require the company to sell its services alongside a joint venture partner.\n\nLooking at electricity consumption \u2013 a measure of the intensity of computing use inside a facility \u2013 some of AWS\u2019 biggest colocation data centers are in or on the outskirts of major cities, the documents show. That includes facilities in and around Frankfurt, Montreal, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo.\n\nExplainer: How the Data Center Boom Tests Grids, Capital Markets\n\nEnvironmental groups and consumer advocates have warned that the rapid data center buildout by Amazon and its biggest rivals is straining electricity grids and prolonging the life of fossil-fueled power plants. Amazon has been the biggest corporate backer of renewable energy projects in recent years, one element of its aim to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040.

This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia\u2019s NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL,\u00a0Tesla\u2019s TSLA\u00a0and Meta META.\n\nMag 7 Earnings Outlook Improves: A Closer Look\n\nNvidia\u2019s beat-and-raise quarterly results have eased the market\u2019s AI-centric worries for now, but the issue is unlikely to go away completely.\n\nThe chipmaker has been a big beneficiary of the ongoing AI-focused spending surge, as it is Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units that are running the datacenters. The stock has lost ground as the aforementioned worries took hold at the start of this month, but it is still up more than +35% this year, handily outperforming the broader market.\n\nThe broader Mag 7 group, of which Nvidia is a key member, has returned largely in-line with the broader market, up +13.7% vs. a gain of +14.1% for the S&P 500 index. The market doesn\u2019t appear to be equally worried about all AI players in the ongoing pullback, with Alphabet continuing to get credit for its efforts even as Meta and some of the others get shunned.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +57.3% from the same period last year on +62.5% higher revenues, putting the company on track to more than double its full-year 2025 earnings from the year-earlier level. Earnings for next year are currently expected to be up +55%, followed by +26.7% growth in 2027.\n\nThis seemingly decelerating growth trend is solely a function of base effects, as demand trends for Nvidia\u2019s chips remain red hot over the next two years. Demand will eventually moderate as we move past the buildout phase of AI infrastructure, and the stock\u2019s recent weakness is likely a reflection of that.\n\nOne could argue that the stock\u2019s impressive gains over the last few years, that has pushed its market capitalization to over $4 trillion, have already factored in these expectations. But if estimates keep rising, as we are starting to see again following the beat-and-raise quarterly results, then Nvidia shareholders will legitimately expect the stock to sustain its positive trajectory.\n\nIncluding Nvidia, the Mag 7 group\u2019s Q3 earnings increased +28.3% from the same period last year on +18.1% higher revenues, which would follow the group\u2019s +26.4% earnings growth on +15.5% revenue growth.\n\nNot all members of the elite group are equally contributing to the growth pace, ranging from Tesla\u2019s -39.5% earnings decline in Q3 to Nvidia\u2019s +57.3% jump and Alphabet\u2019s +33% growth pace.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEstimates for the current period (2025 Q4) are going up, with the current earnings growth rate of +15.4% up from +14.3% a week back and +12.2% two weeks ago.\n\nThe group\u2019s 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +14.6%, followed by +16.8% in 2027.\n\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving.\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.7% weight in the index.\n\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all reports released through Friday, November 21st, we now have Q3 results from 473 S&P 500 members, or 94.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. The reporting cycle has come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with most of the remaining results from the Tech and Retail sectors.\n\nTotal earnings for these companies are up +15.6% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 83.4% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Retail sector, we now have Q3 results for 83.3% of the sector\u2019s members in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail companies are up +16.9% from the same period last year on +7.7% higher revenues, with 72% beating EPS estimates and 84% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nPlease note that the +15.2% earnings growth rate for Q3 represents the blended growth rate for the quarter, which combines the actual results for the 473 companies that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies.\n\nIn terms of S&P 500 index \u2018EPS,\u2019 these growth rates approximate to $261.68 for 2025 and $292.52 for 2026.\n\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here\u00a0>>>>Q3 Earnings Season: Retail Sector in Focus\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

But if estimates keep rising, as we are starting to see again following the beat-and-raise quarterly results, then Nvidia shareholders will legitimately expect the stock to sustain its positive trajectory.\n\nIncluding Nvidia, the Mag 7 group\u2019s Q3 earnings increased +28.3% from the same period last year on +18.1% higher revenues, which would follow the group\u2019s +26.4% earnings growth on +15.5% revenue growth.\n\nNot all members of the elite group are equally contributing to the growth pace, ranging from\u00a0Tesla\u2019s -39.5% earnings decline in Q3 to Nvidia\u2019s +57.3% jump and Alphabet\u2019s +33% growth pace.\n\nEstimates for the current period (2025 Q4) are going up, with the current earnings growth rate of +15.4% up from +14.3% a week back and +12.2% two weeks ago.\n\nThe group\u2019s 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +14.6%, followed by +16.8% in 2027.\n\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving.\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.7% weight in the index.\n\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all reports released through Friday, November 21st, we now have Q3 results from 473 S&P 500 members, or 94.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. The reporting cycle has come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with most of the remaining results from the Tech and Retail sectors.\n\nTotal earnings for these companies are up +15.6% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 83.4% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Retail sector, we now have Q3 results for 83.3% of the sector\u2019s members in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail companies are up +16.9% from the same period last year on +7.7% higher revenues, with 72% beating EPS estimates and 84% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nPlease note that the +15.2% earnings growth rate for Q3 represents the blended growth rate for the quarter, which combines the actual results for the 473 companies that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies.\n\nIn terms of S&P 500 index \u2018EPS,\u2019 these growth rates approximate to $261.68 for 2025 and $292.52 for 2026.\n\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here\u00a0>>>>Q3 Earnings Season: Retail Sector in Focus\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

You don't need to be as savvy as Buffett to have success in the stock market, because the right index fund can deliver spectacular long-term returns for patient investors. 10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett will retire from his role as CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway holding company at the end of 2025, where for the last 60 years he has overseen numerous wholly owned subsidiaries, in addition to a stock portfolio that's today worth $300 billion. Had you invested just $500 in Berkshire shares when he took the helm in 1965, it would be worth a staggering $24.8 million today.\n\nHowever, Buffett is a seasoned expert, and he knows the average investor would struggle to replicate his incredible ability to pick stocks. Therefore, he often recommends they buy a low-cost exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks a diversified index like the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) instead.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is one great option he has named in the past. Here's how it could turn a consistent investment of $500 per month into $1 million over the long term.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA great index fund for investors of all experience levels\n\nThe S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy. The index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning its largest constituents have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft are the world's most valuable companies, with a combined market capitalization of $11.9 trillion, and all three are in the information technology sector. Hence, this is the largest sector in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.\n\nHere are the top five sectors in the index, along with their weightings, and some of their most noteworthy stocks.\n\nSector Sector Weighting Noteworthy Stocks Information technology 35.06% Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple Financials 13.03% Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Communication services 10.32% Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix Consumer discretionary 10.05% Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's  Healthcare 9.75% Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie\n\nData source: Vanguard, State Street. Sector weightings are accurate as of Nov. 19, 2025, and are subject to change.\n\nThe other six sectors in the S&P 500 are industrials, consumer staples, energy, utilities, real estate, and materials, so the index is highly diversified.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, it's hard to ignore the significant influence of the information technology sector. The S&P 500 soared by 214% over the last 10 years, and the information technology sector was responsible for more than half of that overall gain, thanks to its own eye-popping return of 640%. In fact, if we exclude the sector entirely, the S&P's return over the last decade shrinks to just 79%.\n\nThis dynamic is likely to remain in place thanks to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, quantum computing, and more, which could fuel significant returns in stocks like Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the most cost-effective ways for investors to gain like-for-like exposure to the S&P 500. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. In dollar terms, an investment of $10,000 would incur an annual fee of just $3, whereas that fee could be as high as $74 in other funds, according to Vanguard.\n\nTurning $500 per month into $1 million\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered a compound annual return of 10.5% since its inception in 1957, and if it continues to grow at that pace, it could turn a consistent monthly investment of $500 into $1 million in under 30 years:\n\nMonthly Investment Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $500 $106,829 $409,298 $1,269,709\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nThe S&P has delivered an even better average annual return of 14.4% over the last five years, as themes like AI fueled incredible growth for some of the index's largest constituents, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and more. Just last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors that annual AI infrastructure spending could hit an eye-popping $4 trillion by 2030, so momentum in this space is unlikely to slow anytime soon.\n\nHowever, even though the S&P might continue generating accelerated returns over the next few years, it's also important to remember that volatility is a normal part of the investing journey. According to Capital Group, the index experiences a decline of 10% or more once every two and a half years, on average, and it slips into a bear market (a decline of 20% or more) every six years. These bumps in the road are the price of admission for an opportunity to earn life-changing returns over the long term.\n\nThe key to success is investing consistently, even during uncertain times. Warren Buffett is known for buying stocks in all market conditions, but especially during periods of weakness because as a value investor, he loves a bargain.\n\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

But in 2025, it's taken a back seat to a technology that's produced truly jaw-dropping gains.\n\nOver the trailing year, as of the closing bell on Nov. 19, quantum computing pure-play stocksIonQ(NYSE: IONQ), Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT) have delivered respective returns of 90%, 1,860%, 1,530%, and 385%. For comparison, the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite has rallied 20% over the trailing year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nGains of this magnitude imply that investor hype surrounding quantum computing is tangible and may not fade anytime soon. While there are viable reasons to be excited about the real-world applications of Wall Street's hottest innovation, the biggest risk of all to this quartet of quantum computing stocks has gone virtually undetected by the investing populace.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did quantum computing stocks go parabolic in 2025?\n\nIn simple terms, quantum computing involves the use of specialized computers that can make rapid, simultaneous calculations at a considerably faster pace than the world's quickest supercomputers. Quantum computers are capable of tackling complex problems that classical computers are ill-equipped to handle.\n\nOne example of the real-world utility of quantum computers is their ability to speed up the real-time processing and learning capabilities of AI algorithms. Split-second decision-making is particularly important for AI software and systems.\n\nInvestors have also been enamored with the high ceiling for quantum computing hardware and services. Boston Consulting Group estimates this technology can add $450 billion to $850 billion to the global economy by 2040. Meanwhile, online publication The Quantum Insider is looking for this worldwide economic impact to reach the $1 trillion plateau by 2035.\n\nBut if there's one tangible factor that's really lit a fire under the shares of IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. in recent months, it's the prospect of brand-name collaborations.\n\nFor instance, \"Magnificent Seven\" members Amazon and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are both giving their respective quantum-cloud service subscribers access to IonQ's and Rigetti's quantum computers. Amazon's Braket and Microsoft's Azure Quantum can allow clients to run simulations and test their quantum computing hardware.\n\nAdditionally, quantum computing pure-play stocks soared following an Oct. 13 announcement from banking giant JPMorgan Chase that it plans to make direct equity and venture capital investments in 27 \"sub-areas.\" Quantum computing was one of these 27 investment targets identified by JPMorgan's initial research.\n\nAlthough everything would seem to be going swimmingly for quantum computing pure-play stocks, their parabolic ascent may prove fleeting.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis under-the-radar risk threatens to wipe out the first-mover advantage of pure-play stocks\n\nHistory tells us there are several reasons to be skeptical of the supercharged returns for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc.\n\nTo begin with, every hyped technology and game-changing innovation since the arrival of the internet in the mid-1990s has eventually navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly an innovation or trend would earn widespread adoption, gain utility, and/or be optimized. This eventually leads to lofty investor expectations not being met.\n\nQuantum computing is still in the very early stages of commercialization, which exposes it to a high risk of a bubble-bursting event.\n\nFurthermore, quantum computing stock valuations are otherworldly. Whereas price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 in market-leading businesses have historically alerted investors to potential stock market bubbles, the forward-year P/S ratios for IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. are many multiples above this historical mark.\n\nBut there's an even bigger risk to these four quantum computing stocks that virtually everyone is missing. Namely, some of their leading clients could become their top competitors in the years to come.\n\nWith the exception of electric-vehicle maker Tesla, whose operating cash flow has fluctuated in recent quarters, the other six members of the Magnificent Seven are flush with capital and generating more cash flow from their operating activities than they often know what to do with. When a game-changing innovation emerges with an eye-popping addressable market, companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)seize the opportunity.\n\nIn December 2024, Alphabet introduced the world to Willow, the company's latest quantum processing unit (QPU). Last month (October), Alphabet reported that Willow oversaw calculations that were approximately 13,000 times faster than the fastest classical supercomputers on the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, in February, Microsoft announced the arrival of Majorana 1, which is its take on a QPU. Microsoft claims that Majorana 1 is designed to scale to 1 million qubits, which is expected to significantly minimize errors while ensuring calculations that are considerably faster than those of classical computers.\n\nThe point being that we're already observing some of Wall Street's most influential, profitable, and cash-rich businesses encroaching on an industry where the first-mover advantage for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc. may be precarious, at best. Although IonQ recently completed a $2 billion equity offering, the funding situation for most pure-play quantum computing stocks remains uncertain. Trying to compete against the likes of Alphabet or Microsoft with no foundational operating segment and ongoing cash outflows is a recipe for disaster.\n\nWhile several headwinds exist for quantum computing pure-play stocks, internal competition from members of the Magnificent Seven represents the most significant risk to their success -- and perhaps even their survival.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

But in 2025, it's taken a back seat to a technology that's produced truly jaw-dropping gains.\n\nOver the trailing year, as of the closing bell on Nov. 19, quantum computing pure-play stocksIonQ(NYSE: IONQ), Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT) have delivered respective returns of 90%, 1,860%, 1,530%, and 385%. For comparison, the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite has rallied 20% over the trailing year.\n\nGains of this magnitude imply that investor hype surrounding quantum computing is tangible and may not fade anytime soon. While there are viable reasons to be excited about the real-world applications of Wall Street's hottest innovation, the biggest risk of all to this quartet of quantum computing stocks has gone virtually undetected by the investing populace.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did quantum computing stocks go parabolic in 2025?\n\nIn simple terms, quantum computing involves the use of specialized computers that can make rapid, simultaneous calculations at a considerably faster pace than the world's quickest supercomputers. Quantum computers are capable of tackling complex problems that classical computers are ill-equipped to handle.\n\nOne example of the real-world utility of quantum computers is their ability to speed up the real-time processing and learning capabilities of AI algorithms. Split-second decision-making is particularly important for AI software and systems.\n\nInvestors have also been enamored with the high ceiling for quantum computing hardware and services. Boston Consulting Group estimates this technology can add $450 billion to $850 billion to the global economy by 2040. Meanwhile, online publication The Quantum Insider is looking for this worldwide economic impact to reach the $1 trillion plateau by 2035.\n\nBut if there's one tangible factor that's really lit a fire under the shares of IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. in recent months, it's the prospect of brand-name collaborations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor instance, \"Magnificent Seven\" members Amazon and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are both giving their respective quantum-cloud service subscribers access to IonQ's and Rigetti's quantum computers. Amazon's Braket and Microsoft's Azure Quantum can allow clients to run simulations and test their quantum computing hardware.\n\nAdditionally, quantum computing pure-play stocks soared following an Oct. 13 announcement from banking giant JPMorgan Chase that it plans to make direct equity and venture capital investments in 27 \"sub-areas.\" Quantum computing was one of these 27 investment targets identified by JPMorgan's initial research.\n\nAlthough everything would seem to be going swimmingly for quantum computing pure-play stocks, their parabolic ascent may prove fleeting.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis under-the-radar risk threatens to wipe out the first-mover advantage of pure-play stocks\n\nHistory tells us there are several reasons to be skeptical of the supercharged returns for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc.\n\nTo begin with, every hyped technology and game-changing innovation since the arrival of the internet in the mid-1990s has eventually navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly an innovation or trend would earn widespread adoption, gain utility, and/or be optimized. This eventually leads to lofty investor expectations not being met.\n\nQuantum computing is still in the very early stages of commercialization, which exposes it to a high risk of a bubble-bursting event.\n\nFurthermore, quantum computing stock valuations are otherworldly. Whereas price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 in market-leading businesses have historically alerted investors to potential stock market bubbles, the forward-year P/S ratios for IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. are many multiples above this historical mark.\n\nBut there's an even bigger risk to these four quantum computing stocks that virtually everyone is missing. Namely, some of their leading clients could become their top competitors in the years to come.\n\nWith the exception of electric-vehicle maker Tesla, whose operating cash flow has fluctuated in recent quarters, the other six members of the Magnificent Seven are flush with capital and generating more cash flow from their operating activities than they often know what to do with. When a game-changing innovation emerges with an eye-popping addressable market, companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) seize the opportunity.\n\nIn December 2024, Alphabet introduced the world to Willow, the company's latest quantum processing unit (QPU). Last month (October), Alphabet reported that Willow oversaw calculations that were approximately 13,000 times faster than the fastest classical supercomputers on the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, in February, Microsoft announced the arrival of Majorana 1, which is its take on a QPU. Microsoft claims that Majorana 1 is designed to scale to 1 million qubits, which is expected to significantly minimize errors while ensuring calculations that are considerably faster than those of classical computers.\n\nThe point being that we're already observing some of Wall Street's most influential, profitable, and cash-rich businesses encroaching on an industry where the first-mover advantage for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc. may be precarious, at best. Although IonQ recently completed a $2 billion equity offering, the funding situation for most pure-play quantum computing stocks remains uncertain. Trying to compete against the likes of Alphabet or Microsoft with no foundational operating segment and ongoing cash outflows is a recipe for disaster.\n\nWhile several headwinds exist for quantum computing pure-play stocks, internal competition from members of the Magnificent Seven represents the most significant risk to their success -- and perhaps even their survival.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

It \u2060helps create supply security,\" said PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer (\u200cCSO) Jim Andrew on the sidelines of the talks.\n\n\"We need farmers to be successful, we need them to keep farming,\" he added, given the company makes the bulk of its revenues from foods including Walkers Crisps and Quaker Oats.\n\nFILLING THE VOID\n\nDarren Woods, the boss of top U.\u200dS. oil company ExxonMobil was among the U.S. executives, mayors and other sub-national leaders who attended the pre-COP events.\n\nAll those players have an important role in the future of climate action, according to Lou Leonard, Inaugural Dean of Clark University's School of Climate, Environment, and Society.\n\nExisting policies from federal and non-federal actors would lead to a 35% reduction in U.S. emissions by 2035, \u200ba recent analysis led by the Center for Global Sustainability (CGS) at the University of Maryland showed.\n\nMuch of that is being driven by companies.\n\n\"Despite the headlines, the private sector \u200ccontinues to invest in and deploy clean energy,\" said Gina McCarthy, former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and now Managing Co-Chair of 'America Is All In', a coalition of non-federal leaders.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Last year, clean energy jobs in the U.S. expanded three times faster than the rest of the nation's workforce.\"\n\nThe two-week-long COP30 conference also included many smaller U.S. companies in sectors set to profit from the world's shift to low-carbon energy, including in carbon markets.\n\n\"Being here is about connecting globally,\" said Brennan Spellacy, chief executive at carbon credits platform Patch, \"Most of my meetings here are with English, French, and German sustainability leaders and CSOs.\"\n\nU.S. \u2060COMPANIES HAVE A CRUCIAL ROLE\n\nPresident Trump has called climate change a hoax. But regardless of the U.S. \u200bfederal position, regulations are changing across the world to hasten the energy transition even though the final deal at COP30 \u200bdisappointed some.\n\n\"Irrespective of what's coming out of the United States, in terms of rhetoric, the market is moving (and) policymakers are recognising the direction of travel,\" said Jack Hurd, head of both the World Economic Forum's Earth System Agenda and the Tropical Forest Alliance. \u200d\n\nMore U.S. companies are also disclosing their \u2060climate strategies despite the U.S. dropping plans for a federal rule requiring it, although the quality of plans from companies across the globe remains low, data from disclosure platform CDP showed.\n\nWhether they were at the main event or not, the fact U.S. companies appeared was significant, said Maria Mendiluce, CEO at the We Mean Business Coalition.\u2060\n\n\"The U.S. has a decisive role in global climate, energy and industrial policy, so sub-national leaders, non-state actors and businesses showing up at COP30 matters.\"\n\n\"Even when domestic politics are unsettled, the \u200cU.S. shapes markets, capital flows and technology pathways. Its engagement signals to investors that the world's largest economy understands the competitiveness, innovation, security and supply-chain stakes \u200cof the energy transition.\"\n\n(Reporting and Writing by Simon Jessop; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Katy Daigle)\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-u-companies-hold-line-060317445.html", "symbols": ["1MSFT.MI", "8GM.F", "GM.MX", "GM.US", "GMCO34.SA", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "MSF.BE", "MSF.DU", "MSF.F", "MSF.HM", "MSF.MU", "MSF0.F", "MSFT.BA", "MSFT.MX", "MSFT.SN", "MSFT.US", "MSFT34.SA", "OPC.BE"], "tags": ["CARBON-MARKETS", "CLEAN-ENERGY", "CLIMATE-POLICY", "ENERGY-TRANSITION", "SUSTAINABILITY"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.016, "neu": 0.897, "pos": 0.087}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T06:00:00+00:00", "title": "Google Has Been an AI Winner.

The integrated payments company is seeing double-digit revenue and earnings growth recently. Highlighting Warren's conviction in the company, Berkshire refuses to trim its stake in the position even as it grows as a percent of overall holdings.10 stocks we like better than American Express \u203a\n\nBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has turned a small group of companies into enormous bets over the past decade, and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has dominated that list for years. Given Berkshire chairman and CEO Warren Buffett's successful track record with stocks, investors are often looking at the company's stock holdings -- especially its biggest ones -- to get investment ideas. And now a newly disclosed stake in Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has reinvigorated interest in Berkshire's investment moves.\n\nApple still soaks up more than a fifth of Berkshire's stock portfolio, and Alphabet is now a top-10 position, even if it remains modest in dollar terms compared with the conglomerate's very largest holdings. But when I think about which Buffett stock I most want to ride with for the next decade, I keep coming back to a more old-fashioned name.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP) is Berkshire's second largest equity holding and one of its longest-tenured relationships. For me, it captures the heart of Buffett's approach: a durable franchise, advantaged economics, and a business capable of sending real cash back to owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBig conviction in a great business\n\nAs of the end of Q3, Berkshire owned 151.6 million American Express shares, valued at about $50 billion. That stake accounts for close to a fifth of Berkshire's equity portfolio, firmly entrenching American Express as Buffett's No. 2 holding behind Apple.\n\nUnlike the Apple position, which Berkshire has been trimming, the American Express stake has remained unchanged for decades.\n\nThat kind of stability reflects the underlying business. American Express is a global payments company that issues cards, runs its own network, and works directly with merchants. Sitting on both sides of the transaction, it captures rich data on where and how card members spend, which helps the company target high-spending customers and refine rewards in ways rivals struggle to match.\n\nThe company's last full calendar year demonstrates how powerful that model can be.\n\nIn 2024, American Express's revenue rose 9% year over year to $65.9 billion, and earnings per share climbed 25% to $14.01. Additionally, management reported record card member spending, record fee revenue (the revenue the company collects from membership fees from its customers), and record new card acquisitions.\n\nDuring the same year, it returned $7.9 billion to shareholders through $5.9 billion of share repurchases and $2.0 billion of dividends.\n\nContinued momentum\n\nRecent quarters show that momentum has not faded. Second-quarter revenue grew 9% year over year, while earnings per share increased 17%. And third-quarter revenue growth accelerated to a rate of 11%. Earnings per share for the quarter also accelerated, rising 19% year over year.\n\nBenefitting the quarter was a refresh to its consumer and business Platinum cards in the U.S.\n\n\"The initial customer demand and engagement exceeded our expectations, with new U.S. Platinum account acquisitions doubling compared to pre-refresh levels,\" said American Express CEO Stephen Squeri in the company's third-quarter earnings release.\n\nThe successful refresh of the platinum card speaks to the company's pricing power, as it commands an annual fee of $895 -- a fee members eagerly pay to get access to airport lounges and a long list of other perks, including credits for travel, clothes, dining, and more.\n\nAnd valuation is where American Express really stands out among Buffett's big bets. The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24. While financial stocks often sport lower price-to-earnings multiples than stocks in other sectors, it's still notably below both Apple and Alphabet's price-to-earnings ratios of 36 and 30, respectively.\n\nSure, American Express is not cheap compared with many traditional financial stocks, but that multiple looks more reasonable given its consistent double-digit revenue growth, strong credit performance, and shareholder-friendly capital returns.\n\nThe risks, of course, are significant. A meaningful recession could slow card member spending and push credit losses higher, which would crimp earnings and reduce the company's ability to keep growing capital returns at the same pace. Further, competition from banks, buy-now-pay-later providers, and the big card networks remains intense.\n\nOverall, I believe the stock looks attractive despite these risks. Sure, shares could get hit pretty hard in a weak economy. So, anyone who buys the stock today should prepare for volatility and should maintain a long-term view. But I truly believe that, 10 years from now, hindsight will show this as one of Berkshire's best-performing stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in American Express, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and American Express wasn\u2019t one of them.

Here's the Stock Positioned to Win.", "content": "Key Points\n\nWith a vertically integrated tech stack, Alphabet has a big advantage in AI compute.  This advantage should become more evident as AI inference becomes more important. 10 stocks we like better than Alphabet \u203a\n\nWhile investors are looking for who will be the big chip winner in artificial intelligence (AI), that's actually just half the battle. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) currently dominates the market with its graphics processing units (GPUs), while Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has been trying to gain traction in the GPU space and cut into its lead. At the same time, Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) has been helping companies develop their own custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) for AI workloads.\n\nHowever, as compute efficiency becomes more important, the company best positioned for this environment isn't a pure-play chip company; it's Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Let's look at why the company could be poised to be the big winner in the next phase of AI compute.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nVertical integration will win out\n\nThe biggest bottleneck in the world of AI isn't currently a lack of chips; it's a lack of power. That's why compute efficiency is becoming so important. GPUs are great at quickly processing a boatload of data, but they are also energy-hungry. That's justifiable during the training phase of AI, as this is more of a one-time cost. However, as the shift gradually turns to inference, which is an ongoing expense needed to run these large language models (LLMs), compute efficiency becomes much more important.\n\nThis is where Alphabet has a big edge. The company has spent more than a decade developing its own custom AI chips designed specifically for its TensorFlow framework. While Broadcom helped and is winning business with other customers, Alphabet's internal efforts should not be overlooked. As companies begin to bring on their own Broadcom-based ASICs, they simply are not going to be able to match Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are now in their seventh generation.\n\nThe big advantage of Alphabet's TPUs is that they are optimized for Alphabet's cloud computing infrastructure and workloads. This not only helps improve performance, but it also makes its chips more energy efficient, consuming less power. This is a big cost advantage, which should only widen as inference becomes more and more important.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is not selling its TPUs to customers. Instead, for customers to get access to them, they need to run their workloads on Google Cloud. This increases its growth prospects, as it allows it to now capture multiple revenue opportunities within AI.\n\nAlso not to be overlooked is the fact that Alphabet is using TPUs to power its own internal AI workloads. By using its own custom chips, Alphabet has a cost advantage in developing and training its Gemini AI model. It also has a cost advantage when running inference for its models, which gives it a structural edge over competitors such as OpenAI and Perplexity AI, which mostly rely on more expensive and power-hungry GPUs.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe next stage\n\nAs the next stage of AI evolves, Alphabet's vertical integration should put it in a prime position to be the biggest winner. No other company has as complete an AI tech stack as it does. Its recently released Gemini 3 foundation model has garnered widespread praise, with analysts at D.A. Davidson saying it has \"capabilities that in certain areas far exceed what we've typically come to expect from this generation of frontier models.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's recent investment spree in its own customers can be traced back to news that OpenAI was starting to test TPUs for its workloads. According to The Wall Street Journal, after that news came out, Nvidia rushed back to strike a deal with OpenAI and make an investment in the AI model start-up. That reaction shows the respect Nvidia has for Alphabet's TPUs.\n\nAlphabet also has top software platforms, such as Vertex AI, to help customers create their own AI models and apps based on its Gemini model, and even its own massive fiber network, to reduce latency. Its pending acquisition of leading cloud security company Wiz will only add to its AI tech stack.\n\nGiven this, if I could only bet on one AI stock over the long term, I'd choose Alphabet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.
