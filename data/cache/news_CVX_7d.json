If the strike is approved, it would delay the start of production at Pluto LNG 2, which was scheduled for the second half of 2026.\n\nThe dispute arose from findings made by the Offshore Alliance that workers at Pluto LNG 2 get paid 30% less per hour than workers at Chevron\u2019s Wheatstone LNG project. The unions then asked Bechtel, the contractor working on Pluto LNG 2, to raise wages, but Bechtel refused, prompting the threat of industrial action.\n\nPluto 2, which is 91% completed, is an expansion on the Pluto LNG project, which sources natural gas from the Scarborough gas project, operated by Woodside. The expansion has a capacity of 5 million tons of LNG annually, and construction began back in 2022. The original Pluto facility has so far delivered more than 500 LNG cargos, Woodside said earlier.\n\nWoodside Energy said earlier this year it expected significant growth in its oil and gas sales in the next seven years, driven primarily by liquefied natural gas. By 2032, the company should have an annual capacity of 40 million tons from 19 million tons as of this year. Pluto LNG 2 would add 5 million tons to the company\u2019s annual total capacity.\n\n\u201cWith global LNG demand forecast to grow 60% by 2035, Woodside\u2019s increasing scale across the Atlantic and Pacific basins, combined with our marketing and trading business, optimises our capability to meet customer needs,\u201d chief executive Meg O\u2019Neill said at Woodside\u2019s Capital Markets Day earlier this month.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nCOP30 Drops Draft on Transition Away from Fossil Fuels Oil Prices on Edge as Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks Progress European Natural Gas Plummets to 18-Month Low\n\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

(CVX) outlined a sustainable cash flow plan during its November 12 Investor Day that implies a potentially sizable dividend hike. It has averaged 7% over the 25 years, outperforming rivals. Even with a 5% hike in January, CVX stock looks undervalued.\n\nCVX closed at $149.98 on Friday, Nov. 21, 2025, near a recent low of $148.90 on Oct. 10. Moreover, it's well off recent peaks of $160.72 on Sept. 25 and $161.83 on Sept. 2.\n\nMore News from Barchart\n\nThe Saturday Spread: Using Data Science to Pick Out the Most Compelling Discounts (NVO, SOFI, FAST) Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!CVX stock - last 3 months - Barchart - As of Nov. 21, 2025\n\nAt today's price, given Chevron's $6.84 annual dividend per share (DPS), CVX stock has a dividend yield of 4.56% ($6.84/$149.98).\n\nHowever, Chevron has already paid out four quarterly DPS payments. Chevron has a 38-year history of raising its DPS. Its next dividend in January will likely be at least 5% higher.\n\nFuture Dividend Hikes\n\nI discussed this in a recent Barchart article: (Chevron's Free Cash Flow Rises - An Expected Dividend Hike Could Push CVX 14% Higher.\"). I projected that Chevron might raise the DPS by 5% to $7.18.\n\nThat implies that the future yield is now almost 4.8%:\n\n$7.18 / $149.98 = 0.04787 = 4.787%\n\nHowever, in its latest Investor Day discussion, the company seemed to imply that it might raise its DPS by 7%:\n\n\u201cChevron has led its peers in dividend per share growth over the last 25 years with an average annual increase of 7%.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the company stressed that it expects to buy back a lot of shares:\n\n\u201c The company has repurchased shares in 18 of the last 22 years and expects to repurchase $10 to $20 billion per year through 2030\u2026\u201d\n\nThe CFO stressed its \u201csuperior\u201d shareholder returns, and the company said it\n\n\u2026\" expects to extend its track-record of leading dividend growth and consistent share repurchases through the commodity cycle\u2026\"\n\nAll of this suggests that there is no doubt that Chevron will certainly raise its dividend.\n\nSo, how will that affect CVX stock?\n\nAverage Yield and Price Target\n\nMorningstar reports that the market has given CVX stock an average dividend yield of 4.08% over the past 5 years. Seeking Alpha reports that it has been 4.40% over the last four years.\n\nSimilarly, Yahoo! Finance has a 4.21% average 5-year yield statistic.\n\nSo, let's assume that over time, CVX stock will revert to an average yield of 4.21%. Here is how that works out. We can divide the 5% higher DPS by 4.21%:\n\n$7.18 DPS / 0.0421 = $170.55 per share\n\nStory Continues\n\nThat target price is $20.57 higher than today's price, and implies upside of almost 14%:\n\n$170.55 / $149.98 -1 = 1.1372 -1 = +13.72%\n\nIn other words, over the next 12 months, we have good reason to expect to make 14% in price appreciation, as well as make a 4.8% dividend yield.\n\nSo, the total expected return (ER) is almost 18.5%:\n\n13.72% capital gain + 4.72% dividend yield = +18.44% total ER\n\nGiven that CVX stock looks cheap here, what is the best way to play it? Just buy and hold?\n\nAlternatively, you can enhance this return by shorting out-of-the-money (OTM) puts and buying long-dated in-the-money (ITM) calls. Let's look at this.\n\nShorting OTM Puts and Buying ITM Calls\n\nThe trick is to repeatedly make monthly income shorting OTM puts and using that income to help pay for a long-dated in-the-money (ITM) call option.\n\nFor example, the Dec. 26, 2025, options expiry period shows that $140.00 put option strike price has a midpoint premium of 98 cents. That gives the short-seller of this put contract, 6.65% below Friday's close, an immediate yield of 0.70% (i.e., $0.98/$140.00).CVX puts expiring Dec. 26, 2025 - Barchart - As of Nov. 21, 2025\n\nIf repeated each month, this could help pay for a $140.00 call option (i.e., $10 in-the-money or ITM) that expires on June 18. That premium is now $17.35 for $140.00, giving the investor an all-in cost of $157.35 (i.e., $140.00 + $17.35).CVX calls expiring 6/18/26 - Barchart - As of 11/21/25\n\nThis is just $7.37 over today's price (i.e., $157.35-$149.98). However, the investor could also short a call for July right before the close of the June 18 call period.\n\nSo, if an investor can short puts for seven months and makes $0.98 each month, the total accumulated income potential is $6.86. As a result, the net cost is just (assuming the investor exercises the call option):\n\n$157.35 - $6.86 = $150.49\n\nThat is just 51 cents higher than owning 100 shares. The investor's cost is only $51 more with this play.\n\nFor example, the put and call play costs $14,000 in cash collateral to sell short a monthly OTM $140.00put, plus an outlay of $1,735 to buy one $140.00 call, or $15,735. But, after accumulating $98 each month (potentially) for seven months, or $686, the cost is reduced to $15,049.\n\nBut owning 100 shares of CVX outright would cost $14,998, or just $51 less.\n\nHowever, the short-put and call investor has significant leverage. For example, if CVX rises to $170.55, the price target, the call option would have significant intrinsic value:\n\n$170.55 - $140.00 = $30.55 intrinsic value\n\nThat would give the investor who spent $17.35 for those calls a significant return:\n\n$30.55/ ($17.35 - $6.86 income) = $30.55 / $10.49 = 2.91x\n\nThis would give the investor a 191% return, vs. the total return of 18.44% from owning shares. This assumes the investor sells the calls at intrinsic value in six months. That is why shorting one-month OTM puts and buying six-month ITM calls works out quite well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

Goldman Sachs isn\u2019t the only outfit to suggest that renewables are nowhere near ready to displace oil and gas. Berkshire Hathaway is an easy, palatable way to maintain some healthy exposure to the energy sector.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway \u203a\n\nThe proliferation of renewable energy sources like solar and wind isn't happening quite as quickly as initially expected, postponing the point in time where the world's consumption of crude oil and natural gas stops finally stops growing and starts shrinking.\n\nThat's the overall take from investment bank Goldman Sachs' analysts, anyway. In a recent research report, they suggested that the planet's daily consumption of oil will likely grow from last year's average of 103.5 million barrels per day to 113 million in 2040, driven by a combination of growing demand for jet fuel, AI data centers' soaring need for power, and slower-than-anticipated uptake of electric vehicles. This outlook adds five years to Goldman Sachs' previous belief that the world would reach \"peak oil\" in 2035.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nThis shift has implications for all stocks within the energy sector, and plenty of stocks outside of it. It's Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), however, that's arguably positioned to experience the most unexpected benefit of crude oil's now-lengthened lifespan.\n\nToo much agreement to simply dismiss\n\nWere it just Goldman Sachs, the report might be dismissible. Even the investment bank itself acknowledges that its view is markedly \"above consensus.\"\n\nIt's not just Goldman Sachs, though. The International Energy Agency also recently moved its expectation for the planet's peak-oil pivot all the way up to 2050. This aligns with oil giant ExxonMobil's outlook citing the 25% increase in electricity production the world will likely need between now and then. Indeed, even in the most optimistic of scenarios, ExxonMobil says oil and natural gas are still likely to be the planet's single biggest sources of power 25 years from now. And we'll still need lots of crude past that point as the world continues to wean itself from fossil fuels.\n\nPro-oil OPEC, of course, has never not been bullish on crude for the long haul. In July, it reiterated that it believes demand for oil will grow indefinitely into the distant future.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis all obviously bodes well for energy stocks. Investing in oil and gas names, however, can be a bit more \"adventurous\" than most investors may be willing to accept. These stocks tend to ebb and flow on a daily basis with crude prices themselves, yet are also affected by an ever-changing supply and demand dynamic regardless of the commodity's price. It might make sense to curb some of these names' inherently unpredictable volatility.\n\nIt's Berkshire Hathaway, of all things, that just might do the trick.\n\nThe Berkshire you know, and the one you don't\n\nBerkshire remains a most curious enigma. It's one part mutual fund and one part private-equity fund, supporting -- yet also somehow supported by -- an insurance operation with a reliable and largely unrestricted cash flow.\n\nIt's also a surprisingly effective way of tapping into oil's bright future without the usual stress of owning direct exposure to the sector.\n\nThe most obvious way it does so is with its stakes in individual oil and gas stocks Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) and Chevron(NYSE: CVX). As of the latest look, Berkshire owns 265 million shares of the former (more than $11 billion worth), and 122 million shares of the latter (worth nearly $19 billion). Combined, they account for roughly 10% of the conglomerate's entire portfolio of publicly traded stocks.\n\nThen there are the related holdings that you may not realize are part of the Berkshire family because they're small subsidiaries of wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway Energy. These include natural gas pipeline outfits Kern River, Northern Natural Gas, and BHE GT&S. There's also pipeline-optimization outfit LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. (or LSPI), motor oil and automotive additive brand Lubrizol, and Pilot Travel Centers, each of which also benefits in its own way from continued demand for oil and gas.\n\nThe company's regular reporting doesn't provide a great deal of detail as to how these units perform. Berkshire Hathaway does, however, confirm that its gas pipelines and its non-utility energy businesses each reliably add more than $1 billion to the conglomerate's annual operating income, or about 5% of its GAAP bottom line. That's not insignificant, particularly when added to the conglomerate's sizable positions in conventional energy stocks.\n\nMore to the point for interested investors, Berkshire is a clever way of taking on a fair amount of exposure to the energy sector without also taking on its volatility and unpredictability.\n\nAn easy, backdoor way to invest in the energy sector\n\nIt's obviously not the only way to plug into the sector's future, which is suddenly more promising than it was just a few days ago. An energy-focused ETF like the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLE) or the Vanguard Energy ETF(NYSEMKT: VDE) will do the trick nicely as well.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that while Goldman Sachs expects usage of oil to continue growing through 2040, that doesn't mean prices will necessarily follow. Goldman Sachs believes that WTI crude prices will actually slip to an average of $53 per barrel next year, down from a little over $60 right now, thanks to a swell of new supply that will reach the market in the meantime. Lower crude prices make drilling oil and refining it less profitable.\n\nThey don't make it unprofitable though, and oil and gas prices have very little effect on the profitability of Berkshire's wholly owned pipelines and its oil-related brands and services.\n\nBottom line? If Goldman Sachs' outlook has you looking for an easy way to scoop up more exposure to the energy sector, Berkshire Hathaway is a surprising and easy-to-own way of doing it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

But its controlled businesses are arguably even more valuable. The crown jewel is its property and casualty insurance businesses. Given Berkshire's expertise in finding value in the financial sector, it's no surprise that it owns all three of the major credit card companies -- American Express, Visa, and Mastercard.\n\nVisa is the largest of the three, both in terms of market capitalization and transaction volume. The more cards that enter the Visa network, the greater the incentive for merchants worldwide to accept Visa, which boosts revenue that can be used to partner with even more financial institutions, in turn leading to more card issuances. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Visa is converting nearly half of its revenue into free cash flow (FCF) -- which showcases just how efficiently its business operates.\n\nV Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nVisa's main expenses are related to maintaining and expanding its network, labor, and marketing. It's a very capital-light business model, especially considering that Visa partners with financial institutions to issue cards. By not issuing its own cards, Visa doesn't have to worry about bearing the credit risk. So it's not liable for how responsibly or irresponsibly its card users manage their spending.\n\nAnother benefit is that it doesn't have to pay its users rewards. That's also done by financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase's Chase Sapphire and Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Bank of America Customer Cash Rewards card, or the Wells Fargo Active Cash card, which are all Visa cards. By comparison, American Express spends more than double on cardmember perks than it collects in annual fees (but it makes up for that shortfall in other ways).\n\nVisa passes along its free cash flow to shareholders\n\nVisa's high-margin business makes it arguably the greatest cash cow in the financial services industry.\n\nBecause Visa has low capital expenditures, it is able to convert nearly all of its operating cash flow into FCF. Visa returns that FCF to shareholders through dividends and more, importantly, stock buybacks. Metric Full Year Fiscal 2025 Net cash provided by operating activities $23.06 billion Capital expenditures $1.48 billion Free cash flow $21.58 billion Share repurchases $18.19 billion Dividends $4.63 billion\n\nData source: Visa. Fiscal year 2025 ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn Visa's 2025 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2025, the company returned roughly 4 times more cash through stock buybacks than dividends. Here lies Visa's ace in the hole. By using its FCF on buybacks over dividends, Visa consistently reduces its share count. With fewer shares to go around, Visa's earnings per share increase from the core business growing earnings as well as through a lower outstanding share count.\n\nBuybacks are a significant reason why Visa is still a good value. Despite Visa's stock price increasing over fourfold in the last decade, Visa's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still just 32.3 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is lower than its 10-year median P/E of 34.3.\n\nIf Visa were to reallocate share repurchases toward dividends, it would yield a whopping 3.6% instead of its actual yield of 0.8%. However, long-term investors would prefer Visa to continue buying back stock disproportionately and paying a relatively small dividend, as it's a better use of capital if the stock continues to perform well.\n\nYou can count on Visa in 2026 and beyond\n\nVisa checks all the boxes of a high-quality stock to buy now. Major indexes, such as the S&P 500, sport relatively expensive valuations because many of the largest companies by market capitalization have seen their stock prices rise faster than earnings, which puts pressure on these companies to deliver on expectations.\n\nVisa doesn't have that problem because its valuation is reasonable. And yet, it's not a stodgy, low-growth stock like Coca-Cola, where investors can only pencil in mid-single-digit annual earnings growth. Visa should continue to grow earnings in the low double digits per year, even if consumer spending declines.\n\nAdd it all up, and Visa is one of my highest-conviction buys for 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

Visa returns that FCF to shareholders through dividends and more, importantly, stock buybacks.\n\nMetric Full Year Fiscal 2025 Net cash provided by operating activities $23.06 billion Capital expenditures $1.48 billion Free cash flow $21.58 billion Share repurchases $18.19 billion Dividends $4.63 billion\n\nData source: Visa. Fiscal year 2025 ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn Visa's 2025 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2025, the company returned roughly 4 times more cash through stock buybacks than dividends. Here lies Visa's ace in the hole. By using its FCF on buybacks over dividends, Visa consistently reduces its share count. With fewer shares to go around, Visa's earnings per share increase from the core business growing earnings as well as through a lower outstanding share count.\n\nBuybacks are a significant reason why Visa is still a good value. Despite Visa's stock price increasing over fourfold in the last decade, Visa's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still just 32.3 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is lower than its 10-year median P/E of 34.3.\n\nIf Visa were to reallocate share repurchases toward dividends, it would yield a whopping 3.6% instead of its actual yield of 0.8%. However, long-term investors would prefer Visa to continue buying back stock disproportionately and paying a relatively small dividend, as it's a better use of capital if the stock continues to perform well.\n\nYou can count on Visa in 2026 and beyond\n\nVisa checks all the boxes of a high-quality stock to buy now. Major indexes, such as the S&P 500, sport relatively expensive valuations because many of the largest companies by market capitalization have seen their stock prices rise faster than earnings, which puts pressure on these companies to deliver on expectations.\n\nVisa doesn't have that problem because its valuation is reasonable. And yet, it's not a stodgy, low-growth stock like Coca-Cola, where investors can only pencil in mid-single-digit annual earnings growth. Visa should continue to grow earnings in the low double digits per year, even if consumer spending declines.\n\nAdd it all up, and Visa is one of my highest-conviction buys for 2026.\n\nShould you buy stock in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

The integrated business model keeps its earnings stable across various market cycles. This enables the company to generate stable cash flows and maintain dividend payouts.\n\nExxonMobil has rewarded shareholders with dividend hikes for 43 consecutive years, including the quarterly increase for the fourth quarter of 2025. XOM has raised its dividend to $1.03 per share in the fourth quarter, a 4% increase from the dividend of 99 cents per share paid in the third quarter of 2025. The company follows a strategy of sustainably increasing its dividends so that it can continue rewarding shareholders across any market cycle, regardless of the commodity price environment.\n\nThe company\u2019s upstream business, which contributes to the majority of its earnings, continues to grow on the back of its most advantaged assets in the Permian Basin and offshore Guyana. The hydrocarbon production in Guyana has reached record levels, surpassing 700,000 barrels per day. In the Permian Basin, one of the prolific shale basins in the United States, the company has purchased more than 80,000 net high-quality acres in the Midland Basin from Sinochem Petroleum. These developments are expected to strengthen ExxonMobil\u2019s long-term production profile and support its profitability.\n\nAt the same time, its involvement in refining, chemicals and specialty products acts as a cushion against upstream earnings volatility. Together, these factors are expected to enable ExxonMobil to deliver stable profits and continue returning strong cash flows to shareholders.\n\nOther Integrated Majors with a High Dividend Yield\n\nChevron Corporation CVX and BP plc BP also have an integrated business model with a robust upstream presence. Notably, both integrated majors maintain peer-leading dividend yields. Currently, CVX has a dividend yield of 4.55%, while BP\u2019s yield is 5.53%.\n\nXOM\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\n\nShares of ExxonMobil have risen 13.7% over the past six months compared with the 15.9% improvement of the composite stocks belonging to the\u00a0industry.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, XOM trades at a trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) of 7.6X.

You're not alone. This deep dive will help you get beyond the headlines and numbers. Chevron's stock has been on a bit of a seesaw lately, falling 3.4% over the last week and dipping 2.3% in the past month, though it's still up 2.5% for the year to date. These recent price swings come as oil markets have faced renewed volatility due to global supply concerns and shifting energy policies. This is a reminder that Chevron's fortunes are closely tied to geopolitical shifts and industry trends. When we score Chevron on our six major valuation checks, it comes in at a 3 out of 6, signaling there may be some value but certainly room for debate. Up next, we will break down how analysts typically value a company like Chevron and, later, share a smarter way to see where the stock really stands.\n\nChevron delivered -2.7% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Oil and Gas industry.\n\nApproach 1: Chevron Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\n\nA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company\u2019s intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today\u2019s value. This approach provides a clear picture of what the market is really valuing for a business like Chevron.\n\nChevron\u2019s most recent Free Cash Flow (FCF) is $16.3 Billion. Analysts forecast that Chevron\u2019s cash flows will continue to grow over the next decade, with projections reaching $32.4 Billion by 2035. It is important to note that only the first five years of these forecasts are based on analyst consensus. Figures beyond 2029 are extrapolated from historical and sector trends.\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the estimated fair value for Chevron shares is $325.79. Based on today\u2019s share price, the DCF model suggests the stock is trading about 53.9% below its calculated fair value, indicating a significant margin of safety for potential investors.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUED\n\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Chevron is undervalued by 53.9%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover 919 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows.CVX Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Chevron.\n\nApproach 2: Chevron Price vs Earnings\n\nThe Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is often favored for valuing profitable companies like Chevron because it directly compares a company\u2019s share price to its earnings. This offers a snapshot of how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar of profit. A higher PE can signal growth expectations or lower risk, while a lower PE often points to limited growth or greater risk. What qualifies as \u201cfair\u201d can depend on the industry, the company\u2019s market position, and its growth outlook.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCertainly, Chevron currently trades at a PE ratio of 23.7x. This is noticeably higher than the average PE of 13.1x for the Oil and Gas industry and above its peer average of 21.7x. On the surface, this premium might suggest the stock is expensive, but such a comparison does not consider Chevron\u2019s unique strengths or performance dynamics.\n\nThis is where Simply Wall St\u2019s proprietary Fair Ratio comes in, providing a more tailored benchmark. The Fair Ratio for Chevron sits at 23.7x, calculated from a holistic view of the company\u2019s future earnings growth, profit margins, market cap, industry, and associated risks. This approach outweighs a simple industry or peer comparison as it brings Chevron\u2019s real-world prospects and risk profile into focus.\n\nWhen stacking up Chevron\u2019s actual PE ratio of 23.7x against its Fair Ratio of 23.7x, the valuation appears to be right on target. This suggests the current share price fairly reflects the company\u2019s fundamentals and growth expectations.\n\nResult: ABOUT RIGHTNYSE:CVX PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\n\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1422 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth.\n\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Chevron Narrative\n\nEarlier we mentioned that there\u2019s an even better way to understand valuation, so let\u2019s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, yet powerful way to connect your personal view or story about a company with actual financial forecasts and an estimated fair value. This approach turns numbers into real, actionable meaning.\n\nOn Simply Wall St\u2019s Community page, Narratives are a quick and accessible tool used by millions of investors to build and share these perspectives. Whether you see Chevron as a long-term value play, a dividend king, or a company facing regulatory headwinds, you can reflect your unique expectations for its future revenue, profit margins, and risks.\n\nEach Narrative ties together your storyline with a fair value estimate and instantly shows whether Chevron looks under- or overvalued against the current share price, helping you decide when to buy, hold, or sell. The best part is that Narratives update dynamically as new information arrives, such as earnings results or major news, keeping your view in sync with reality.\n\nFor example, among current Chevron Narratives, some investors estimate a fair value as high as $197 per share by focusing on its asset synergies and reliable dividends. Others cite risks of slower growth and regulatory pressures to support a fair value closer to $124.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Chevron?

With an estimated 10 billion barrels of recoverable resources, the Mopane field has triggered intense competition among global oil majors seeking an early foothold in a region poised to become a top-15 oil producer within the next decade.\n\nWhy Mopane Is Transforming Namibia Into an Oil Hotspot\n\nNamibia currently has no commercial hydrocarbon production. However, a series of high-profile discoveries in the Orange Basin, including TotalEnergies\u2019 Venus, have turned the country into one of the most sought-after exploration frontiers.\n\nMopane, in particular, stands out, backed by its resource scale and strategic location.

Although Exxon later exited the bidding and Petrobras acknowledged being outbid by TotalEnergies, competition remains intense among the remaining contenders.\n\nTotalEnergies & Chevron Bring Strategic Advantages & High Stakes\n\nBoth Chevron and TotalEnergies have strong strategic incentives to secure the Mopane stake.\n\nChevron, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), is working to reinvigorate its frontier exploration portfolio. After mixed drilling results in the Orange Basin earlier this year, the company sees Mopane as a potential anchor asset.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nTotalEnergies, meanwhile, already operates the nearby Venus project, a 150,000-barrel-per-day development. Developing Mopane alongside Venus could offer operational synergies, although Venus\u2019 high gas content adds technical complexity. With major African projects in Mozambique and Uganda facing financial and security hurdles, Namibia has become a key focus for TotalEnergies\u2019 growth plans.\n\nA Tight Race That Will Shape Namibia\u2019s Energy Future\n\nAs Galp narrows its shortlist, the contest between TotalEnergies and Chevron is intensifying. Whichever company secures the stake will gain a premier position in one of the world\u2019s most promising new oil provinces. For Namibia, the partnership will help determine the pace, scale and structure of its emergence as a major global oil supplier.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fuel diversity is increasing as fleets incorporate lower carbon intensity fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG), renewable natural gas (RNG), biodiesel, and renewable diesel along with petroleum diesel. Yet this fuel diversification can create new challenges: maintaining compatibility across mixed fleets, managing multiple supplier relationships, and ensuring that lubricants work optimally with evolving fuel technologies.\n\nChevron addresses these challenges through integrated expertise in both advanced fuels and lubricants. This dual capability allows the company to deliver solutions that work together to help maximize performance, efficiency, and lower carbon intensity across diverse fleet operations.\n\nAdvanced fuel solutions driving measurable results\n\nChevron\u2019s broad fuel portfolio demonstrates the company\u2019s focus on both innovation and practical performance. Each fuel type delivers specific advantages that address different needs while maintaining the reliability fleet operators require.\n\nChevron is widely known for its production and supply of petroleum diesel, which is an essential fuel for most fuel portfolios. From here, fleets have options to incorporate a range of lower carbon intensity fuel choices, depending on the emission reduction targets they may have set, available engine types, and their budget.\n\nWhen considering lower carbon intensity fuel options from Chevron, their renewable diesel represents years of innovation in lower carbon intensity fuel technology. Produced from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and plant oils, it can deliver an average of 50% lifecycle carbon intensity reduction compared to petroleum diesel. The fuel integrates with existing infrastructure, normally requiring no engine modifications or special handling procedures.\n\nChevron\u2019s biodiesel blends may offer carbon emission reduction benefits with existing infrastructure compatibility. B20 blends (i.e., blending 20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel) can provide lifecycle carbon reductions while maintaining cold weather operability and fuel system compatibility. Biodiesel has natural lubricity and meets fuels specifications without the need for additives.\n\nFor fleets looking to reduce their costs along with emissions, Chevron\u2019s CNG and RNG solutions can deliver compelling advantages. CNG typically costs around 20% less than diesel on an energy-equivalent basis while reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by 90% relative to 2010 standards.\u00a0 According to an American Gas Foundation study, RNG produced from organic waste sources such as manure from dairy farms can reduce carbon intensity by more than 100% on a lifecycle basis, making it one of the lowest carbon intensity transportation fuels available today. Chevron\u2019s network of CNG stations offer refueling times comparable to traditional diesel.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLubricant innovation enabling fuel flexibility\n\nManaging multiple fuel types can bring complexity to lubricant use. Different engine technologies require different oils, creating inventory challenges and increased risk for misapplication. Chevron\u2019s Delo 600 ADF eliminates this complexity while optimizing performance across all fuel platforms. In essence, Delo 600 ADF serves as a one-stop-shop for all engine technologies, helping to cut down on confusion, cost, and inventory in the maintenance shop.\n\nIntroduced in 2019, Delo 600 ADF incorporates Chevron\u2019s patented OMNIMAX\u2122\n\ntechnology formulated with just 0.4% ash content, a 60% reduction compared to conventional CK-4 oils. This ultra-low ash formulation serves both traditional diesel and compressed natural gas engines with a single product, eliminating inventory complexity and application risks.\n\nThe certification process validated this capability through rigorous testing. \u201cThis certification followed an exhaustive two-year field testing process in Cummins engines, culminating in a complete engine teardown and inspection by Cummins engineers,\u201d explained Shawn Whitacre, Principal Engineer at Chevron. The result was Cummins CES 20092 approval, the industry standard for mobile natural gas engine oils in North America.\n\nAdditionally, Delo 600 ADF is ahead of the curve for PC-12, the next generation heavy-duty engine oil specification currently in development. This forward-thinking certification means fleet operators investing in Delo 600 ADF today are positioning themselves for future regulatory requirements without likely needing another oil change. While competitors scramble to reformulate their products when PC-12 becomes mandatory, Delo 600 ADF users will already be compliant, avoiding the disruption and costs associated with specification transitions.\n\nThe synergy of integrated solutions\n\nThe true advantage of Chevron\u2019s approach emerges when fuels and lubricants work together as an integrated system. This synergy delivers performance and efficiency benefits for operations.\n\nRenewable diesel generates lower particulate matter emissions than petroleum diesel. When combined with Delo 600 ADF\u2019s ultra-low ash formulation, it significantly extends diesel particulate filter performance (DPF). Research shows that approximately 90% of the incombustible ash that clogs diesel particulate filters comes from metallic additives in engine oil. By reducing ash content by 60%, Delo 600 ADF can dramatically extend DPF service life. Fleet operators have reported extending DPF service life by up to four times, reaching up to 24,000 hours before requiring maintenance.\n\nThis extended DPF life directly impacts fuel economy through multiple mechanisms. Ash buildup increases system backpressure and demands more frequent regeneration events, both of which consume fuel. Chevron\u2019s research demonstrates that vehicles using conventional oils experience steadily worsening fuel economy as ash accumulates, while those using ultra-low ash oil maintain better fuel efficiency over time. The data indicates potential fuel economy retention benefits of up to 3%.\n\nFor operations using Chevron\u2019s renewable diesel, the fuel\u2019s superior combustion characteristics produce less soot and fewer combustion byproducts than petroleum diesel. This combustion profile complements Delo 600 ADF\u2019s low-ash formulation, supporting extended maintenance intervals and sustained engine performance.\n\nFor CNG operations, the benefits are equally compelling. Natural gas combustion produces minimal soot, but using oils formulated for diesel applications have historically been incompatible. Delo 600 ADF\u2019s dual certification eliminates this risk while its ultra low-ash formulation complements CNG\u2019s lower nitrogen oxide emissions. Operations using both products can also see lower carbon intensity from CNG and extended oil drain intervals from the lubricant\u2019s advanced formulation.\n\nOil drain intervals see improved extension with this integrated approach. Fleet operators using Chevron fuels and Delo 600 ADF consistently report safe extensions from intervals for both short- and long-haul operations. These extended intervals can translate to reduced downtime, lower maintenance costs, and decreased environmental impact from waste oil disposal.\n\nReal-world transformation across fuel platforms\n\nThe benefits of Chevron\u2019s products are proven when real customers find value. Take Santoro Oil for example, a family-owned heating and cooling service provider in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts, operates in challenging stop-and-go conditions with significant idle time. Since switching to Delo 600 ADF, the company has extended oil drain intervals from 350 hours to 1,050 hours while increasing DPF service life by four times, reaching up to 24,000 hours before requiring maintenance. With industry average DPF cleaning costs at $500 and replacement costs around $1,200, these extensions represent substantial financial savings.\n\nFor mixed fleet operations, the integrated approach proves transformational. Ecology Auto Parts operates 625 vehicles running on both traditional diesel and CNG.\n\n\u201cUsing one oil means we don\u2019t need multiple tanks,\u201d explained Greg Evans, the company\u2019s fleet director. \u201cThere\u2019s no risk of misapplication, and it reduces our inventory and labor expenses.\u201d\n\nThe operational simplicity enables Ecology Auto Parts to evaluate additional fuel options, including renewable diesel and biodiesel blends, without concern for lubricant compatibility or inventory complexity.\n\nCustomers have also found operational success by incorporating CNG into their fuel portfolio. Gazelle Transportation, a fleet that specializes in transporting crude oil and petroleum products in California, added seven CNG trucks to their fleet in 2019, working with Chevron as their fuel provider. Within 90 days, drivers were comfortable in the new vehicles, noting very minor differences in performance compared to traditional diesel.\n\nFast forward to 2025, and Gazelle now has 23 CNG trucks \u2014 demonstrating their confidence in CNG technology.\n\n\u201cThe benefit of running CNG trucks for us has been lowering our number two operating expense \u2014 diesel fuel,\u201d shared Ron Lallo, CEO of Gazelle Transportation. \u201cIt\u2019s number two next to labor. We\u2019ve essentially been able to cut our fuel costs in half.\u201d\n\nSingle-source advantage\n\nWorking with Chevron as a single provider for all fuel types and lubricants enables operators to streamline their supply chain while ensuring compatibility across operations. This single-source approach eliminates the complexity of managing multiple suppliers with different specifications, quality standards, and delivery schedules while providing access to technical expertise across the entire range of fuel and lubricant products.\n\nThe technical support advantage proves particularly valuable during fuel transitions. Chevron\u2019s integrated expertise means fleet operators receive guidance on optimizing both fuel selection and lubricant performance for their specific operational profiles. This holistic approach identifies opportunities for efficiency improvements that might be missed when working with separate fuel and lubricant suppliers.\n\nSupply chain reliability benefits from consolidated sourcing as well. Single delivery schedules, unified quality standards, and integrated inventory management reduce administrative burden while ensuring consistent product availability. For fleet operators managing multiple locations, this simplification translates to significant cost savings and operational efficiency.\n\nChevron is your source for the path forward\n\nAs the transportation industry evolves under increasing pressure to improve efficiency and reduce emission intensity, fuel diversification has become increasingly important for competitive operations. Yet diversification without integration creates new complexities that can erode the intended benefits.\n\nChevron\u2019s approach helps solve this challenge by delivering both advanced fuel technologies and compatible lubricant solutions through a single provider with deep expertise in both domains. The real-world experiences across diverse applications validate the transformative impact of this integrated strategy. From extending drain intervals and reducing DPF maintenance to improving fuel economy and simplifying inventory management, the benefits are substantial and measurable.\n\nAs fleet composition continues diversifying with alternative fuel adoption, Chevron\u2019s integrated approach offers operators the flexibility to optimize their complete energy strategy while maintaining the operational simplicity that drives profitability in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\nClick here for more information about working with Chevron as a fuel and lubricant provider.\n\nThe post Powering performance: How Chevron\u2019s integrated fuel and lubricant solutions are transforming fleet operations appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powering-performance-chevron-integrated-fuel-153000526.html", "symbols": ["CHV.BE", "CHV.DU", "CHV.F", "CHV.HM", "CHV.MU", "CHVX34.SA", "CVX.BA", "CVX.MX", "CVX.US"], "tags": ["BIODIESEL", "CNG", "LUBRICANTS", "RENEWABLE-DIESEL", "RNG"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.038, "neu": 0.83, "pos": 0.132}}, {"date": "2025-11-20T14:19:55+00:00", "title": "The Tech Rotation Is On and Dividend-Paying Blue-Chips Are the Winners", "content": "Riddy / iStock via Getty Images\n\nTechnology investors are rotating into dividend stocks as a response to several growing market pressures. After years of chasing high-growth tech companies in a zero-interest-rate environment, many investors are now seeking more stable, income-generating assets amid economic uncertainty and falling interest rates. The spectacular run-up in tech valuations, particularly in AI-related stocks, has left many investors concerned about stretched valuations and the sustainability of growth narratives, prompting a defensive shift toward companies that can demonstrate profitability and return cash to shareholders. Especially since, according to Bloomberg, the Magnificent 7 are spending less on buybacks and more on capital expenditures.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points\n\nData is increasingly showing that investors are moving from tech giants to dividend-paying blue-chip stocks.

(NASDAQ: META) tap the credit market for billions to fund artificial intelligence projects. The result is the first sustained selloff for the group since April, with the Nasdaq 100 leading the broader market lower as investors ditch tech winners in favor of more defensive stocks. One of the beneficiaries: companies with juicy dividend payments. That group, which includes old-economy stalwarts, is often coveted when riskier stocks start to look expensive. They also tend to be calmer in times of turbulence. The Cboe Volatility Index jumped above 24 on Tuesday (11/18), surpassing its long-term average of 19.\n\nBlue-chip stocks are shares of large, well-established, financially stable companies with a consistent and reliable performance history. They are often considered less risky and are a popular choice for long-term investors.

UBS maintains a short-term $4200 target, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) project gold could reach $5000 next year, citing strong global demand and rising geopolitical risk. Investors hesitant to hold physical gold are opting for alternatives like the closed-end fund GGN and the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE: GLD) for easier exposure. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video\n\nWhen Lee asked me about the latest moves in gold, I told him the speed of the prior run still stood out. The metal sprinted toward the 4100 and 4200 range so quickly that many investors avoided buying simply because they felt they were chasing. Then the selling pressure hit. Gold dropped nearly twenty percent, falling back into the high 3900s before buyers stepped in again.\n\nWhy the Rally Restarted\n\nOnce Washington signaled that a government shutdown might be avoided, the tone in the market shifted. Investors who had been waiting for a pullback finally had an entry point. Lee reminded me that central banks in China, Japan and other regions buy gold consistently, often daily. That buying creates a natural floor when prices dip, and it helped gold recover back above 4100.\n\nPrice Targets and Institutional Views\n\nLee walked through the forecasts. UBS is looking for a move back to 4200 in the near term. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America see the possibility of 5000 dollars by the end of next year. Those calls assume ongoing geopolitical tension and steady central bank demand, which both of us agreed seem plausible given the current environment.\n\nHow to Own Gold Without Buying Bars\n\nWe also talked about the alternatives to physical gold. Lee mentioned GGN, a long running closed end fund managed by Mario Gabelli that blends oil and gas exposure with major gold miners such as Newmont (NYSE: NEM) and Barrick (NYSE: GOLD). It trades at a low price point and pays a monthly dividend, which makes it appealing for investors looking for income.\n\nFor investors who want direct exposure to gold without storing it, GLD offers a straightforward option. The fund holds physical gold and tracks the price closely, though it does not distribute dividends. Either approach gives investors a way to participate in the gold trade without buying bullion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Costco Surprise\n\nLee and I laughed about a report showing that gold bars at Costco were selling at prices below the spot rate after member discounts. It created an unexpected arbitrage opportunity for anyone willing to buy a bar while shopping for groceries. As we pointed out, if global tensions intensify, gold could move far beyond current targets and potentially test 6000 or 7000.\n\nTranscript:\n\n[00:00:04] Doug Mcintyre: Lee. I can't figure out where gold is going, you know, there was this huge bull marketing gold, God, I mean it. Uh, it went up so fast, it was blinding. Uh, now people are worried that, you know, it may have, in essence, got out over its skis.\n\n[00:00:21] Doug Mcintyre: A why is it moving, and B, where is it going?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Yeah, you're, you're exactly right. And when we had the, the pullback recently where we had some pretty heavy selling, you know, gold was not, uh, escaping any of that action. And it was, it, after trading up to 4100, 4200, it got pushed back down in, in literally into correction territory.\n\n[00:00:47] Lee Jackson: It was down like a quick 20% when it fell back to like 33950, 39 60. But boy, I'll tell you one thing. The minute that the tables turned and that there was some indication that the government, you know, malfeasance is over and the shutdowns about to end if they finally sign it because it took 'em a while to get back to Washington apparently.\n\n[00:01:12] Lee Jackson: But now the gold, gold has had a nice, uh, return rally. 'cause I think there was really a lot of people that were anxious to try to buy some gold, but they just were like, Ugh, can I chase this at 4,000 or 4,100 or 4,200? But the one thing that we've tried to remind people and we've suggested for years to all of our readers and, uh, people that watch our, our videos that you should always keep 5% of gold in there or 5% of some sort of combo of gold and, and, silver and, and, you know, other commodities like that. But now, you know, when investors got a chance to get back in, they pushed it back up well over the 4,100 level and, and UBS says they're heading in on 4,200 and there's two firms out there, I think Goldman Sachs is one, and I think V of A is the other one, they think Golds has a $5,000 target by the end of next year.\n\n[00:02:07] Doug Mcintyre: Yeah, well if that's true, you better. I would buy it now if you think it's,\n\n[00:02:11] Lee Jackson: Yeah, you may want to get a little bit. You know, the thing is, and we try to remind people of this too, central banks, especially in China, Japan, um, other countries, they are buying gold for their central bank every single day. And I'm sure when it dipped a little bit, they were real buyers.\n\n[00:02:30] Lee Jackson: So you have kind of a natural support under it because of, of that kind of central bank buying, which helps a little bit. But again, it had gone up so much, so fast so far that, um, I think a lot of people, a, that were in early, decided to sell some, and B, the people that were late to the party decided to hold off.\n\n[00:02:50] Lee Jackson: But, you know, everybody on Wall Street is, is reasonably bullish. And like I said, UBS has a short term, 4,200 target and two banks have 5,000 as a target.\n\n[00:03:01] Doug Mcintyre: And you know, if people don't wanna buy physical gold, there are alternatives to that. In terms of et, you know, if you don't wanna buy gold Lee, what are a couple other ways you can basically get in on the Gold Trade?\n\n[00:03:14] Lee Jackson: Well, one way is a good one. Mario Gabelli has run this little closed in fund for a million years and it didn't do anything for a million years 'cause it was like 50% oil and gas and 50% gold. And the symbol on that is GGN. It's, you know, it's exchange traded fund it. It's not very expensive. It's about 480, 470 now, but it pays a really good dividend.\n\n[00:03:37] Lee Jackson: And think about it, if you want an old gold, what better contrarian trade now is than buying oil and gas and every, it's, you know, Gabelli's got all the big names in there, you know, um, Exxon's in there (NYSE: XOM), Chevron's in there (NYSE: CVX), Conoco Phillips is in there (NYSE: COP). But then he is got all of the gold miners in there too, right?\n\n[00:03:56] Lee Jackson: He's got Newmont and he's got Barrack and he is got all of those in there. And, and again, it not only does it pay like an 8% dividend or something like that, it pays it monthly. Oh, nice. Yeah. And so that's simple GGN or, you know, you can always, uh, buy the, there is a way to buy physical gold without buying gold bars, although you can go, I saw an interesting thing.\n\n[00:04:20] Lee Jackson: I saw a guy in, in a morning piece I got that said, you can literally go to Costco. and buy a gold bar there. Yeah. How much, you know, it's like an, an ounce, I guess. Um. And after you get your discount and everything, it's, it's cheaper than the spot price. So you literally had, you were saying you have a gold arbitrage, at Costco next to the chickens.\n\n[00:04:43] Lee Jackson: And so I was like, okay, that makes sense though. You could, you could have been up on it already, but, it's gonna be interesting to see how it plays out because if we have any sort of, and the world seems to be teetering a little bit, and if anything goes wrong, you know, heck it go through 5,000 up to six or seven.\n\n[00:05:01] Lee Jackson: If, oh yeah, we had something serious go wrong.\n\n[00:05:04] Doug Mcintyre: If the world goes to hell, gold is gonna, gold's gonna trade. Way. Way.\n\n[00:05:08] Lee Jackson: Yeah. And, but again, another way, if you wanna own the physical gold, but not go to Costco or Port Knox and buy it, you can buy the, the uh, GLD fund.\n\n[00:05:18] Doug Mcintyre: Yeah.\n\n[00:05:19] Lee Jackson: Which holds physical gold. It doesn't pay a dividend, but it actually holds physical gold.\n\n[00:05:24] Lee Jackson: So that's another way to play it. So\n\n[00:05:27] Doug Mcintyre: I would say this in conclusion, if you think the world's gonna go fall apart, short Palantir and go long gold.\n\n[00:05:38] Lee Jackson: Yeah, that would be a good pair. There you go.\n\n[00:05:40] Doug Mcintyre: That'd be your ultimate crazy pairs trade\n\n[00:05:43] Doug Mcintyre: I'm sorry. That's it. That's my, that's my pairing trade.\n\n[00:05:47] Lee Jackson: Well, if you're one of those people that is a doom and glooner, that's, and that's your ultimate trade. You know, that's, that's my trade. But the one thing you always gotta remember, you gotta know where to gold at. And, uh, if you haven't seen that video, you gotta see it. So look for a wet of gold out and look for bars at Costco.\n\n[00:06:03] Lee Jackson: Good.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong.

Then, I try to find some stocks within it which look promising for gains.\n\nMy objective is typically to buy an inverse ETF or put option on the index, while buying the stocks within that index which have the best shot to produce gains.

Subscribe today!\n\nThe broad stock market looks ill to me. Maybe something will turn that around quickly. But I\u2019m not counting on it. In particular, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DOWI) and the Dow Jones Industrials SPDR (DIA) ETF look especially vulnerable to me. That doesn\u2019t mean gains are not possible, only that risk is high.\n\nSo my mission, apart from looking at possibly buying an ETF that runs counter to DIA, or buying a put option on it, is to see where the outliers are. That is, the stocks within that tidy 30-member index that might be upside leaders anyway. Even if they simply outperform in a down market, there\u2019s \u201calpha\u201d and positive return to be had. In a treacherous market like this one, why not look around every corner, and under every rock? I try to.\n\nSo with that as the task, here are three Dow Industrials components that I picked out of the 30 in that venerable index. They all have at least a fighting chance to earn a profitable return over the balance of 2025. Here they are.www.barchart.com\n\nStock #1: Merck\n\nMerck (MRK) has the best-looking chart in the Dow 30 by far. And it\u2019s about time! It has been languishing amid a range of issues, some related to drug pricing regulation, some to the company\u2019s own maladies. But this is still a blue-chip healthcare firm. And the weekly chart shows promise. An earnings multiple under 11x adds to the attraction here.www.barchart.com\n\nStock #2: 3M\n\n3M (MMM) has quietly had an outstanding run. And while it is far from undervalued technically, it is a rock-solid blue-chip, if not the most dynamic. 21x earnings is not a steal, but these are times when simply avoiding terrible chart patterns might end up looking like a \u201cwin.\u201d The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) here is hinting at another leg higher, and MMM is making up for some lost time here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nStock #3: Chevronwww.barchart.com\n\nChevron (CVX) is a good example of the fact that at times like these, a range-bound chart coupled with a price-sales ratio under 2x is a good combination. There\u2019s a nice 4.5% dividend yield here too.\n\nThese three stocks all have upside potential. But just as importantly, their charts and valuations are not as risky looking to me as most tech stocks. That alone could be a ticket to success the remainder of this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rob Isbitts did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

In light of recent weakness in oil prices, the energy giant is taking a different approach than its main competitor. This pivot, coupled with another initiative, could bode well for long-term investors, who may already be interested in this stock for its long-term dividend growth track record. 10 stocks we like better than Chevron \u203a\n\nChevron(NYSE: CVX) is one of America's largest integrated oil and gas companies. A descendant of the Standard Oil Trust, Chevron's corporate roots run deep. Over the past few decades, it has also acquired numerous well-known oil companies, including Gulf Oil, Texaco, and Hess.\n\nFor investors today, however, what's most important is whether this blue-chip energy stock is a great long-term investment opportunity. This is especially true as crude oil prices remain under pressure due to supply and demand trends less favorable to the industry. Despite these headwinds, there may be merit to adding a name like Chevron to a long-term investment portfolio.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBetter-than-feared results indicate Chevron is riding out the oil industry's current rough patch\n\nRecent weakness in crude oil prices has resulted in a drop in profitability for major energy companies. However, in the case of Chevron, its own latest fiscal results were \"better than feared.\"\n\nLate last month, the company released results for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2025. Not surprisingly, Chevron reported year-over-year declines in both revenue and earnings:\n\nMetric Q3 2025 Q3 2024 Percentage Change Revenue $49.73 billion $50.7 billion (1.9%) Net Income $3.5 billion $4.5 billion (22.2%) Earnings Per Share (EPS) $1.82 $2.48 (26.6%)\n\nHowever, ahead of earnings, sell-side analyst estimates called for Chevron to report revenue of $47.2 billion and earnings of $1.71 per share.\u00a0A key reason for these better-than-feared results was likely the company's increase in production during the quarter. Energy production increased 21% last quarter, to 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) daily.\n\nThat said, while Chevron, like its competitor ExxonMobil, has been increasing production lately, this isn't going to be the case for much longer.\n\nA major shift in focus\n\nPer Chevron's 2025 Investor Day Presentation, Chevron's new agenda entails \"stronger cash flow\" and \"growing value.\"\u00a0That is, while still growing annual production by a modest 2%-3% per year, the company plans to reduce annual capital expenditures by around $1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also continues to aggressively reduce costs. By 2026, these efforts could save Chevron up to $4 billion annually. Alongside cost-cutting measures, Chevron is also capitalizing on a new growth opportunity. The energy giant plans to have a gas power plant in Texas, exclusively for producing energy for AI data centers, up and running within the next few years.\n\nThanks to these various changes, Chevron believes that it can increase annual cash flow by 10% annually between now and 2030, with much of this cash flow growth returned to investors via share repurchases and dividends. This should be music to the ears of long-term investors.\n\nShould you buy Chevron today?\n\nIf you are a conservative investor, seeking steady returns through both dividends and price appreciation, there may be an opportunity here with this stock.\n\nChevron already has a strong dividend growth track record, with 37 years of consecutive dividend growth.\u00a0Currently, Chevron's forward dividend yield comes in at around 4.4%.\u00a0Increased cash flow points to further dividend growth in the years ahead.\n\nWhile fully priced at nearly 20 times forward earnings,\u00a0a slight valuation premium to ExxonMobil, further growth could sustain Chevron's forward P/E, with the stock appreciating in line with increased earnings and dividends.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chevron wasn\u2019t one of them.

The fund's holdings offer high yields and have an excellent record of increasing their dividend payments. The ETF has also delivered high total returns for investors over the years. 10 stocks we like better than Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF \u203a\n\nGenerating passive income is a big part of my investment strategy. It provides me with more cash to invest and helps me become more financially independent.\n\nI've found that investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a great way to complement my passive income investment strategy. One of my favorite ETFs to buy for income is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD). Here's why I plan to buy even more of the high-yield ETF this November.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA simple way to invest in 100 top dividend stocks\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks an index (the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index) that measures the performance of 100 of the highest-quality dividend stocks. It screens companies based on several dividend quality characteristics, including dividend yield and five-year dividend growth rate. It also selects companies based on their financial strength compared to their peers.\n\nThe fund's holdings have an average yield approaching 4% and have grown their payouts at a more than 8% compound annual rate over the past five years.As a result, it provides investors with a nice current income stream that steadily rises, a great combo for those seeking to generate passive income. At its current annualized dividend rate, I can generate nearly $40 of annual passive income from every $1,000 I invest in the fund.\n\nThe cream of the dividend income crop\n\nThe ETF holds a who's who of elite dividend stocks. For example, one of its top ten holdings is PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). The beverage and snacking giant's dividend currently yields 3.9%, well above the S&P 500's 1.2% yield. The company generates lots of durable cash flow to support its dividend and also has a strong balance sheet. PepsiCo has increased its dividend for 53 straight years, qualifying it as a Dividend King, a company with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases. The iconic company has grown its dividend at an impressive 7.5% compound annual rate since 2010.\n\nThe fund's top 10 holdings feature several other high-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks. Notable names include Coca-Cola (2.9% current yield and 63 consecutive years of dividend increases), Chevron (4.5% current yield and 38 years of dividend growth), and Verizon (7.7% current yield and 19 straight years of dividend increases). In essence, the fund enables investors to hold a diversified portfolio of some of the world's best higher-yielding dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIncome growth and attractive total return potential\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF provides investors like me with more than just an attractive current passive income stream. The fund doesn't just hold high-yielding dividend stocks; it holds companies that steadily increase their payments. As a result, the income stream provided by this ETF steadily increases: SCHD Dividend data by YCharts\n\nThat growth has two notable benefits. Investors collect more income each year. Additionally, they benefit from value appreciation. As the underlying companies grow their earnings and increase their dividends, their share prices tend to rise accordingly. That combination of income and price appreciation provides investors with a high total return.\n\nSince its inception in 2011, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has produced an 11.6% average annual total return.It has also delivered a more than 10% average annualized total return over the past three-, five-, and 10-year periods.\n\nPassive income and more\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is a perfect fund to buy for passive income. It offers a high-yielding income stream backed by 100 of the world's best dividend stocks. These companies also have excellent track records of increasing their dividends and shareholder value.

Unions applied for a strike license this week, with industrial action planned for the next couple of months.\n\nThe union, Offshore Alliance, is in a salary dispute with the contractor building the facility, Bechtel, and they have so far failed to reach an agreement, leaving only the option of industrial action, according to the union. It says, as quoted by Reuters, workers at Pluto 2 get paid 30% less per hour than workers at Chevron\u2019s Wheatstone LNG facility.\n\nBechtel earlier offered workers a 5% salary rise but the overwhelming majority of them rejected the offer, leaving matters in the hands of the Australian Fair Work Commission, which is the authority with the power to greenlight the strike.\n\nThis would set back the project, which is 91% completed and was scheduled to start producing and shipping liquefied gas in the second half of next year. Pluto 2 is an expansion on the Pluto LNG project, which sources natural gas from the Scarborough gas project, operated by Woodside. The expansion has a capacity of 5 million tons of LNG annually and construction began back in 2022. The original Pluto facility has so far delivered more than 500 LNG cargos, Woodside said.\n\nThe Australian energy major is among the biggest global players in LNG. It said earlier this month it expected its sales of crude oil and natural gas to rise by some 50% by 2032, driven by growing demand for energy, especially in Asia.\n\nGrowing at an annual rate of 6%, sales could hit 300 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2032, chief executive Meg O\u2019Neill said at the company\u2019s Capital Markets Day. As a result, net operating cash flow is also expected to increase by 6% annually to 2032, to $9 billion, from $5.8 billion in 2024.\n\nGrowth will be especially pronounced in LNG, where Woodside expects its capacity to increase from 19 million tons annually in 2024 to as much as 40 million tons in 2032.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nSanctions Slow Russian and Iranian Crude Flows to China Russian Crude Piles Up but Oil Prices Refuse to Move U.S. Backs Nuclear Plant Restart as AI Power Demand Soars\n\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

Namibia, which currently has no commercial oil production, is positioning itself to become a top-15 producer globally within the next decade.\n\nGalp plans to select a partner by the end of the year, and a company spokesperson confirmed that negotiations were progressing \u201cwith a shortlist of preferred bidders strongly aligned with Mopane,\u201d though names were not disclosed. TotalEnergies and Chevron declined to comment.\n\nMore than a dozen firms, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and Brazil\u2019s Petrobras, had expressed interest earlier in the process. Exxon withdrew in June, while Petrobras said it had been outbid by TotalEnergies.\n\nBoth TotalEnergies and Chevron already operate nearby oilfields in Namibia\u2019s Orange Basin. TotalEnergies\u2019 150,000-barrel-per-day Venus project sits close to Mopane and could offer valuable synergies, though its high gas content poses development challenges. The French company aims to reach a final investment decision next year. Chevron, meanwhile, is seeking to reinvigorate its frontier exploration strategy following mixed results from earlier Namibian drilling.\n\nFor TotalEnergies, success in Namibia would reinforce Africa\u2019s vital role in its upstream portfolio, which accounts for up to 40% of its global oil and gas output.\n\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

The oil giant has multiple drivers to fuel its growth plan. It should have no trouble continuing to increase its high-yielding dividend. 10 stocks we like better than Chevron \u203a\n\nChevron (NYSE: CVX) has been an elite dividend stock for decades. The oil giant has increased its dividend for 38 straight years. It hasn't just been giving investors token raises to keep that streak alive. Chevron has grown its payout at a healthy 7% compound annual rate over the past quarter-century and at a peer-leading 5% compound annual rate over the last decade. That's impressive considering how volatile oil prices have been over the years.\n\nThe energy company is in a strong position to continue delivering healthy dividend growth through at least 2030. Here's a look at what fuels that view.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChevron's path to 2030\n\nChevron recently revealed its outlook through 2030. The oil giant anticipates delivering more than 10% annual growth in both its adjusted free cash flow and earnings per share through 2030. That outlook assumes Brent oil (the global benchmark price) will average around $70 a barrel. While Brent is currently below that level (it's in the mid-$60s), it has been at or above $70 for much of this year.\n\nThat's a robust growth rate for a company of Chevron's size. Of the 100 largest companies in the S&P 500, only 35 currently expect to deliver more than 10% annual earnings per share and free cash flow growth through 2027. Meanwhile, only nine of those companies are as financially strong as Chevron (a bond rating of AA- or higher). Chevron is the only company of that remaining group with a dividend yield above 4% (currently 4.5%). That places the oil giant in a class of its own due to its combination of growth, financial strength, and yield.\n\nA look at what's fueling Chevron's plan\n\nChevron's five-year plan comes on the heels of a lot of hard work to transform the company into a free cash flow growth machine. Years of project execution and a series of strategic acquisitions, culminating in the acquisition of Hess this year, have enabled the energy company to build a resilient, world-class portfolio with a diverse set of growth drivers it expects to capitalize on over the next five years.\n\nThe bulk of its growth will come from its low-cost upstream oil and gas operations. Chevron has a long list of expansion projects under construction or in development. The company's acquisition of Hess provided it with a position in the prolific Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. The ExxonMobil-led joint development group (along with Chevron and China's CNOOC) started up its fourth development (Yellowtail) earlier this year. They have already approved three more projects (including the $6.8 billion Hammerhead project in September of this year), which will come online through 2029. They have one more project in the pipeline (Longtail) that they anticipate bringing online by 2030.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGuyana isn't Chevron's only growth driver. The company also has projects underway or in development offshore Africa, in the Mediterranean, and the Gulf of Mexico (also known as the Gulf of America in the U.S.). Additionally, the company has a couple of downstream projects under construction that should start up in 2027 (a petrochemical project in Qatar and a polymers project in the U.S.).\n\nChevron is also building out several new energy platforms to complement its legacy fossil fuels businesses. It's building a green hydrogen project in the U.S. and an oilseed processing plant for biofuels. Additionally, it's developing a couple of carbon capture and storage hubs, a lithium project, and gas-fired power solutions for AI data centers.\n\nThe company's well-rounded approach helps reduce risk while putting it in a strong position to deliver on its growth forecast.\n\nAmple fuel to continue growing its high-yielding dividend\n\nChevron is a rare company that provides investors with both robust growth and income. While oil prices can be volatile, the company has a well-protected downside due to its diversification, low breakeven level ($50 a barrel for its dividend and capital spending program), and elite balance sheet. Meanwhile, it has substantial upside potential due to its robust growth outlook, which should provide it with ample fuel to continue growing its dividend at a healthy rate. That growth and income combination could give Chevron the fuel to produce robust total returns over the next five years, making it an excellent stock to buy and hold through at least 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chevron wasn\u2019t one of them.

The U.S. Treasury\u2019s recent clearance allowing potential buyers to engage with Lukoil has triggered a scramble among global energy giants. Ahead of the Nov. 21 sanctions deadline, the United States had\u00a0blocked\u00a0Lukoil's attempt to sell assets to Swiss-based trader Gunvor.\n\nStrategic Overlaps Drive Chevron\u2019s Interest\n\nChevron, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), is evaluating assets where operational and geographic overlap present a natural fit. The company already partners with Lukoil in Kazakhstan\u2019s Karachaganak and Tengiz fields \u2014 two major contributors to global crude supply via the CPC pipeline. Acquiring additional stakes here could deepen Chevron\u2019s presence in Central Asia while strengthening its position in key upstream projects. The company\u2019s interest extends to assets in regions like Nigeria, where both firms share involvement in offshore developments.\n\nExxon Eyes West Qurna 2 as Prize Asset\n\nExxon has emerged as a serious contender, particularly drawn to Iraq\u2019s West Qurna 2 \u2014 one of the world\u2019s most significant undeveloped oil fields. With experience operating the adjacent West Qurna 1 before exiting last year, Exxon sees an opportunity to reestablish a major foothold in Iraq\u2019s energy landscape. A successful acquisition would mark one of the company\u2019s most impactful upstream moves in the region in over a decade.\n\nA Global Portfolio in Play\n\nBeyond the Middle East and Central Asia, Lukoil\u2019s international footprint spans Europe, Africa and the Americas. Its assets include refineries, retail stations and stakes in oilfields across Mexico, Ghana, Egypt and Uzbekistan. The breadth of the portfolio has attracted not only strategic buyers like Chevron and Exxon but also investment firms such as Carlyle, which are assessing selective opportunities amid the fire sale.\n\nGeopolitics Raise the Stakes\n\nThe unfolding contest isn\u2019t just commercial \u2014 it\u2019s geopolitical. U.S. sanctions aim to pressure Moscow amid the Ukraine conflict, and the forced divestiture of Lukoil\u2019s assets shifts strategic energy resources into new hands. Countries like Iraq are even seeking temporary waivers to manage the transition.\n\nKey Picks\n\nInvestors interested in the\u00a0energy\u00a0sector may consider some top-ranked stocks like Canadian Natural Resources Limited CNQ and Oceaneering International, Inc.

Cyprus shares maritime borders with Lebanon, but the Lebanese government hasn\u2019t fully ratified an agreement delineating the exclusive economic zones of the two countries. That has prevented Cyprus from opening up areas abutting Lebanese waters for hydrocarbons exploration.\n\nThe Cypriot president said that there\u2019s \u201cinterest from energy giants\u201d to license more areas \u2014 or blocks \u2014 from within Cypriot waters. ExxonMobil and partners QatarEnergy also hold hydrocarbon exploration licenses for two blocks off Cyprus\u2019 southern coast.\n\nIn one block, the partnership has made two significant natural gas deposit discoveries known as Glaucus and Pegasus. Glaucus is estimated to hold approximately 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas, while Pegasus\u2019 size is still being determined.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-could-cypriot-natural-gas-144414232.html", "symbols": ["CAP.PA", "CGM.F", "CGM.HM", "CVX.US", "E.US", "EIPAF.US", "ENI.BE", "ENI.DU", "ENI.F", "ENI.HM", "ENI.MI", "ENI.MU", "ENI1.F", "NG.COMM", "RYDAF.US", "SHEL.US", "TOTA.F", "TOTB.BE", "TOTB.DU", "TOTB.F", "TOTB.HA", "TOTB.HM", "TOTB.MU"], "tags": ["EASTERN-MEDITERRANEAN", "ENERGY-SECURITY", "HYDROCARBONS", "LIQUEFIED-NATURAL-GAS", "NATURAL-GAS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.017, "neu": 0.841, "pos": 0.142}}, {"date": "2025-11-19T14:16:00+00:00", "title": "CVX or CNQ: Which Energy Giant Looks Stronger Right Now?", "content": "Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ) and Chevron Corporation (CVX) sit on opposite sides of North America, yet both are central players in global oil markets. They share a common identity as large, diversified producers with meaningful exposure to long-lived assets, heavy oil, and large-scale upstream developments. With oil prices under pressure and capital allocation under tighter investor scrutiny, the comparison between the two has become especially relevant. Both companies are leaning on operational efficiency, disciplined spending, and strategic growth initiatives \u2014 but their risk profiles and earnings trajectories look very different.\n\nCNQ is benefiting from robust production momentum, record volumes, and a well-insulated asset base. Chevron, meanwhile, is navigating a softer macro backdrop, valuation strain, and a long list of operational and market-driven pressures that continue to influence sentiment. Against this backdrop, investors are trying to understand which company offers the best balance of resilience and upside.\n\nWith that context in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the fundamentals to determine which one may be a better investment candidate right now.\n\nThe Case for CVX Stock\n\nChevron brings scale, diversification and a high-quality portfolio, but its near-term setup is quite complicated. The biggest headwind stems from weakening commodity prices. Brent is projected to trade around $55 per barrel through 2026 due to oversupply and global demand uncertainty. Historically, Chevron\u2019s profitability has dropped sharply when crude softens, and with oil prices already trending lower, its earnings remain exposed. As it is, the company posted 21.5% production growth in Q3, yet upstream earnings fell 28% year over year as liquid realizations declined.\n\nChevron\u2019s demand exposure to China adds further uncertainty. Much of China\u2019s recent intake has gone into strategic petroleum reserve storage rather than true consumption. With the country\u2019s underlying demand weakening, any slowdown in its strategic buying could push Brent much lower, which would directly pressure CVX\u2019s margins.\n\nOperationally, the company faces additional hurdles. Tariffs and inflation pressures could lift operating costs. Downstream earnings remain vulnerable to California\u2019s shifting regulatory landscape. Frontier exploration plans introduce capital-allocation risks. The Hess integration, while strategically compelling, comes with near-term transaction costs that already pulled down earnings. Fourth-quarter turnarounds will temporarily suppress production and downstream profits as well.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChevron still generated strong cash flow \u2014 $9.9 billion in operating cash flow and $7 billion in adjusted free cash flow \u2014 in Q3. Production exceeded 4 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (BOE/d). The Hess acquisition is progressing well and should deliver synergies in 2025.\n\nThe Case for CNQ Stock\n\nCNQ is firing on all operational cylinders. The company posted a standout third quarter, with corporate production jumping 19% year over year to 1.62 million BOE/d, marking its second record quarter of the year. Liquids and gas volumes both reached all-time highs, supported not only by strong organic execution but also by accretive acquisitions across the Duvernay, Montney and Palliser regions. Lower heavy-oil operating costs \u2014 down 12% year over year \u2014 further bolstered margins. Management expects production-per-share to climb 16% in 2026, pointing to meaningful scale-driven cash flow growth.\n\nThe backbone of CNQ\u2019s stability is its long-life, low-decline oil sands resource. With the second-largest reserves in the global energy sector, CNQ can operate with minimal sustaining capital compared with shale peers. The company\u2019s full ownership of the Albian mining assets added 31,000 barrels per day of zero-decline bitumen, enhancing integration and creating room for further optimization. Third-quarter oil sands mining averaged 581,000 barrels per day of SCO at over 100% utilization, and unit operating costs were held to about $21. This depth of resources \u2014 backed by a 47-year reserve life index \u2014 anchors predictable cash flows well into future cycles.\n\nCanadian Natural\u2019s Financial strength adds another layer of support. A BBB+ credit rating, debt/EBITDA of 0.9X, ample liquidity above C$4.3 billion, and a conservative debt-to-capital ratio reinforce balance-sheet durability. CNQ\u2019s 5% dividend yield is comfortably covered, and its 25-year streak of dividend increases underscores capital discipline.\n\nThat said, Canadian Natural is not immune to the broader macro backdrop. Volatile oil prices, environmental policy pressure, and pipeline constraints remain credible risks. Emission-related regulation could lift compliance costs, while commodity softness could temporarily limit buybacks and free-cash-flow upside. Still, CNQ\u2019s low-decline structure and cost advantages give it an enviable margin cushion.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nCanadian Natural is up more than 10% year to date, outpacing Chevron\u2019s 6% gain. CNQ\u2019s stronger operational momentum and less cyclical earnings base have offered a clearer support level.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation Comparison\n\nChevron is currently valued at a forward P/E of 19.2X \u2014 about 60% higher than its five-year average \u2014 even though oil prices remain near multi-year lows. If crude weakens further, the stock could face a valuation pullback. In contrast, Canadian Natural Resources trades at a more reasonable 15.1X, giving it a valuation that better matches its growth outlook and position within the sector.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEPS Estimate Revisions\n\nOver the past month, Chevron\u2019s EPS estimates for 2025 and 2026 have been revised downward.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, Canadian Natural\u2019s estimates have moved higher, reinforcing the divergence in earnings visibility and momentum.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth companies sit at important crossroads within the global energy market, but their trajectories diverge. Canadian Natural carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) due to its resilient low-decline assets, disciplined capital returns, cleaner valuation, and upward earnings revisions. Chevron holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) as margin pressure, valuation risk, and commodity exposure overshadow its operational strengths. While both remain influential in the sector, CNQ is clearly better positioned right now thanks to its stability, improving fundamentals, and more favorable risk-reward profile.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm cites a favorable investor day and the strength of Chevron\u2019s materials and commentary. Analysts note that Chevron\u2019s focus on both emerging and mature assets underpins free cash flow and dividend growth potential. Morgan Stanley increased its price target to $177 from $174 after Chevron\u2019s third-quarter earnings beat. The firm highlights 11% above-consensus EPS and strong production, and expects upcoming strategic updates, particularly around growth plans through 2030, to be focal points. Raymond James also raised its target, from $160 to $175, keeping an Outperform rating. The firm emphasizes Chevron\u2019s strong financial base, high shareholder payouts, and solid asset base, and expects further synergy realization from the HES acquisition and continued upside. Wells Fargo initiated coverage with an Overweight rating and a $190 price target. The firm notes Chevron\u2019s leadership in dividend growth and efficient capital return direction despite sector-wide bearish sentiment. Wells Fargo sees Chevron as well positioned for performance across varied commodity scenarios.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Bearish Takeaways\n\nBarclays trimmed its price target to $158 from $160 and maintained an Equal Weight rating. This reflects near-term caution and modestly lower long-term forecasts tied to its sector outlook. Scotiabank\u2019s updated target of $165 (up from $160) retains a Sector Perform stance. However, the firm underscores that while forecasts are above consensus, they remain \u201cdisappointing\u201d relative to original industry margin expectations. Citi and Wells Fargo both referenced caution regarding Hess Midstream, with reduced estimates reflecting concerns over Chevron\u2019s rig activity in the Bakken region. These updates emphasize potential growth headwinds for Hess Midstream and, by extension, some uncertainty regarding Chevron's near-term execution in that segment.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts?

Head to the Simply Wall St Community to discover more perspectives or begin writing your own Narrative!NYSE:CVX Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\n\nWhat's in the News\n\nCatalyst news emerged as Chevron began exploring the acquisition of Lukoil's global assets after the U.S. Treasury cleared the company to enter acquisition talks. The potential deal, valued at over $20 billion, puts Chevron among several contenders for Lukoil's portfolio. OPEC+ announced a freeze on further oil production increases for January through March, following a December rise in output. This policy adjustment is expected to influence major energy producers, including Chevron, amid evolving market conditions. Certain operational risks in Venezuela have intensified for Chevron due to heightened political uncertainty in the region. The company has reiterated its commitment to employee safety, environmental protection, and safeguarding asset integrity during this period. A significant incident occurred at Chevron's El Segundo refinery near Los Angeles, where a major fire broke out, leading to large flames and thick smoke. All employees were reported safe and accounted for following the event.\n\nHow This Changes the Fair Value For Chevron\n\nConsensus Analyst Price Target has risen slightly to $172.80 from $172.04. This reflects increased confidence in Chevron\u2019s outlook. The discount rate increased modestly from 6.79% to 6.96%, indicating a marginally higher risk premium applied by analysts. The revenue growth estimate improved, with the rate now at -0.51% compared to the previous -0.60%. This suggests slightly less contraction is expected. The net profit margin forecast has increased marginally to 10.06% from 9.95%. This signals expectations for stronger profitability. The future P/E ratio has climbed to 27.89x from 26.97x. This suggests the market is assigning a higher valuation to Chevron\u2019s earnings prospects.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Never Miss an Update: Follow The Narrative\n\nA Narrative is the story behind a company\u2019s numbers.

Also, with the energy transition not going as fast as hoped, some new oil and gas supply would come in quite handy.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that it expected crude oil output from Gulf of Mexico fields to rise from the current 1.8 million barrels daily to 2.4 million barrels daily as early as 2027.\n\n\u201cWe believe that offshore production will play an increasingly larger role in filling the global energy demand,\u201d the chief executive of Talos Energy, Paul Goodfellow, said a few months ago during a conference call. \u201cQuestions are starting to arise about the continued long-term economic viability of onshore basins... At the same time, technological advancements have unlocked significant deepwater reserves,\u201d he elaborated.\n\nThese technological advancements concern many aspects of offshore drilling, but one has been called a breakthrough: drilling in ultra-high pressure. Last year, Reuters reported that new drilling tech was being deployed by Big Oil, making it possible to drill under pressure of up to 20,000 pounds per square inch. Analysts believed at the time this technology could add some 5 billion barrels to recoverable oil reserves.\n\nRelated: Russian Crude Piles Up but Oil Prices Refuse to Move\n\nNow, the Financial Times is reporting that Big Oil is deploying the ultra-high pressure drilling tech in the Gulf of Mexico, tapping reserves previously inaccessible. Chevron and TotalEnergies are doing it with the Anchor project, the report noted, and Shell and BP are going to start using similar tech at new fields in a couple of years. It appears that from the perspective of offshore oil producers the outlook for demand is quite bright.\n\nMeanwhile, new discoveries abound in the Gulf. A few months ago, Talos Energy announced that it had struck oil at the Daenerys field, with Wood Mackenzie saying it could be the most significant discovery since Shell\u2019s Whale discovery in 2017. BP, meanwhile, said it would spend $5 billion on developing the Tiber-Guadalupe field, with reserves estimated at some 350 million barrels and production seen at 80,000 barrels daily. Chevron\u2019s Anchor project, the one with the breakthrough tech, is seen driving peak production of 75,000 barrels daily with a productive life spanning 30 years, according to the supermajor.\n\nDeepwater drilling has been a strategic focus for big oil companies for several years now, as fields in shallower waters mature and production declines, while oil demand appears to keep going higher. Shale was one major diversification venue, but now shale is moving past its boom years, and while there are still a lot of barrels in the shale formations, extracting them is getting costlier.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn offshore drilling, on the other hand, the upfront costs are something the industry is used to, and the lifespan of the projects tends to justify those upfront costs, with Talos Energy saying that breakeven costs at offshore fields could come in at as little as $20 per barrel in some fields. Last year, Wood Mackenzie forecast that oil and gas production from deepwater fields would surge by 60% over the next five years alone\u2014almost as if there had been no forecasts of peak oil demand growth. Rystad Energy also expected a substantial increase in spending on offshore drilling. One might even go as far as to call it a boom.\n\nThe Financial Times reported this week that investment in the Gulf of Mexico fell to $18.6 billion last year. That was down from $43.7 billion ten years ago, the publication noted. But things are about to change\u2014global offshore investment is already on the rise and what Big Oil is doing in the Gulf suggests it is not going to be an exception.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nChevron Turns to India for Jet Fuel After California Refinery Fire Fallout Sanctions Slow Russian and Iranian Crude Flows to China Turkish State Oil Giant Launches Landmark $4 Billion Islamic Bond\n\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

(BRK.A, BRK.B) took a $4.9 billion stake in Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), a rare tech-heavy move for the firm. CEO Warren Buffett also oversaw major cuts in the company's holdings of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC)\u2014together representing a stock sell-off worth more than $12 billion. A leadership handoff could be underway as incoming CEO Greg Abel may already be influencing investment decisions, once something Buffett closely managed.\n\nAs Buffett prepares to step back as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the company is making moves few would expect from the Oracle of Omaha.\n\nBuffett spent decades telling investors he doesn't understand technology stocks well enough to bet big on them. Yet Berkshire Hathaway's latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the company has made a new $4.9 billion wager on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), while offloading shares in long-held favorites like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC).\n\nAre these signals that the company is shifting its investment philosophy? The surprise stake in Google\u2019s parent company, worth about $4.9 billion, marks one of the conglomerate\u2019s biggest moves in recent years\u2014one that seems to challenge Buffett\u2019s long-standing caution toward Silicon Valley.\n\nWith Buffett planning to \u201cgo quiet\u2014sort of,\u201d as he put it last week, after his final months as CEO, the moves could mark a new era for one of the world\u2019s most closely watched portfolios.\n\nWhy Alphabet Now?\n\nThe company\u2019s new 17.8 million-share position in Alphabet signals a potential change in how Berkshire approaches technology stocks. The purchase stands out as Berkshire\u2019s largest new investment of the quarter, after Buffett grew the company's massive cash pile to $382 billion while others poured their money into tech stocks this year.\n\nAt the 2019 Berkshire annual meeting, Buffett and his late partner Charlie Munger said they had \"screwed up\" not buying Alphabet earlier, despite watching Google advertising spark massive sales across their own businesses. At the time, shares traded around $59, increasing nearly fivefold in price since.\n\nThis isn't a typical Buffett buy. The Oracle of Omaha has consistently shied away from tech stocks he says he doesn't fully understand, making an exception only for Apple\u2014which he famously reframed as a consumer products company instead. The timing could suggest Abel's growing influence as he prepares to officially take over as CEO in the New Year.\n\nStill, Berkshire's Alphabet shares are worth far less than its stakes in Coca-Cola (KO, 9.9%) and Chevron Corp. (CVX, 7.1%), continuing a portfolio historically dominated by consumer staples and energy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSelling of Apple and Bank Shares Continues\n\nThe cut in Apple shares is part of a longer story between the companies. Berkshire slashed its shares by almost 15% last quarter, which means it's sold about 74% of its stake in AAPL in the last two years alone. That seems to mark a systematic unwinding of what was once one of Buffett's highest-conviction bets.\n\nThe steady sell-off of Bank of America stock suggests Buffett\u2014or his team\u2014sees limited upside in traditional banking at 2025 stock values, possibly concerned about economic headwinds or simply rebalancing away from financial services. Together, those moves continue a broader pattern of profit-taking on legendary legacy holdings. Even so, Apple remains Berkshire\u2019s largest single investment\u2014about 21% of its total portfolio.\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire added $1.2 billion to its Chubb insurance stake, indicating that it remains interested in financial services when the stock price is right.\n\nSome Lessons To Takeaway from Berkshire's Moves\n\nBerkshire's portfolio reshuffling could offer three crucial lessons for everyday investors:\n\nFirst, even legendary investors evolve: the Alphabet purchase proves that sticking rigidly to old rules can mean missing once-in-a-generation opportunities. Profit-taking isn't just about timing the market and selling a stock when its price is high. It's also about managing risk. Buffett's continued sales of Apple stock could result from a worry over making Berkshire too beholden to the fate of this one stock. Diversification remains key for any portfolio. Berkshire\u2019s latest moves suggest a cautious optimism toward Big Tech, as well as an eye for finding value amid historically high stock prices. For retail investors, this could be a signal that it\u2019s time to reassess whether they\u2019re too concentrated in yesterday\u2019s winners or missing those of tomorrow.\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-hathaways-latest-stock-moves-164211998.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "BAC.US", "BRK.US", "CVX.US", "GOOGL.US"], "tags": ["CONSUMER-STAPLES", "ENERGY", "PORTFOLIO-RESHUFFLING", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.984, "neg": 0.034, "neu": 0.884, "pos": 0.082}}, {"date": "2025-11-18T15:36:00+00:00", "title": "How to use the tax-loss selling occurring now to pick up quality stocks on the cheap", "content": "It's that time of year again: the annual tax-loss harvest. It's happening across the brokerage firms right now, and it's happening in size. Advisors are locking in losses to offset the big realized gains from earlier in the year, especially back in April when clients trimmed their winners and booked profits. We know from trading partners across the Street that most of the sell orders for stocks with year-to-date losses are coming in as market orders, which we interpret as tax loss sellers just looking to get out \u2013 if only for 31 days as the IRS dictates. Between now and year-end, these heavy flows are likely to continue. Portfolios are being repositioned, stocks are being rotated out for the 31-day wash-sale rule, and you're getting a lot of tax-selling. Some good companies are getting thrown out just because they're sitting in the red \u2014 not because anything's necessarily broken from a fundamental perspective. To be clear, I'm not a fan of buying losers. A 52-week low is not a buy signal \u2014 most names hit new lows for a reason. But this year might present some opportunities because there's a lot of technical and tax-driven distortion out there. We had a strong start to 2025, a narrow leadership group \u2013 led by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" and now we're seeing potential dumpster-diving opportunities \u2014 temporary dislocations in quality names. Think about what's showing up on the radar right now: the \"Dogs of the Dow\" for 2025 \u2014 your highest-yielding blue chips \u2014 include names like Verizon , Chevron , Amgen , Johnson & Johnson , Coca-Cola and IBM (we own most of these companies). These aren't speculative trades. They're global franchises yielding between 3% and nearly 7%. VZ CVX YTD mountain VZ and CVX year to date And then, if you look beyond the 'Dogs' \u2014 some of tickers on the 52-week-low list you could find decent companies that might be having an off year. You've got Procter & Gamble , which is actually both a Dog of the Dow and a new-low name; Adobe , ADP , Kimberly-Clark , Kraft Heinz , and Charter Communications \u2014 all making fresh lows. Historically, these haven't been super high-risk tickers \u2014 these are established companies. This exercise shouldn't be about trash picking \u2014 it's about sifting through temporary weakness for quality that's been unfairly sold. If you can find a name with a solid balance sheet, strong free cash flow, and a dividend that pays you to wait, it may be worth a look while everyone else is selling it for tax reasons. And that brings me to one of those names I'm actually buying: IBM . IBM YTD bar IBM in 2025 IBM is a current Dog of the Dow yielding just over 2%, and I think it's quietly turning into one of the more interesting opportunities in large-cap tech. The market still treats IBM like an old-school mainframe company, but that's outdated. Nearly half their revenue now comes from software, hybrid cloud, and AI services. In the last quarter, software revenue was up almost 9% and free cash flow came in around $13.5 billion. At roughly 25 times forward earnings, you're getting a high-yielding, cash-rich, AI-levered enterprise name at a discount \u2014 and that's not something you can say about most of mega-cap tech right now. The z17 mainframe refresh is ramping up, Red Hat continues to deliver, and enterprise AI adoption is just starting to flow through. If anything, the year-end weakness we've seen looks like an opportunity. \"Harvesting\" this year doesn't mean chasing broken stories. It means recognizing that forced, tax-driven selling creates inefficiencies \u2014 and if you're disciplined, it can let you sometimes pick up quality companies like IBM at cheaper valuations. For long-term investors, I think this is the kind of setup that can quietly compound while the market's busy watching the shiny objects.

Increasing consumer preference for eco-friendly products and corporate sustainability commitments are further accelerating adoption.\n\nDownload PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=68114533\n\nSustainable Fuel Market Highlights\n\nMarket Data:\n\n287 Market Data Tables 81 Figures 323 Pages\n\nTop Companies:\n\nADM (US) \u00b7 Shell plc (UK) \u00b7 Siemens Energy AG (Germany) \u00b7 Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia) \u00b7 Chevron Corporation (US)\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nDrivers:\n\nRising environmental concerns about fossil fuels Supportive policies promoting low-carbon alternatives\n\nRestraints:\n\nHigh initial capital costs for infrastructure and production\n\nOpportunities:\n\nGlobal transition to renewable and sustainable energy systems\n\nChallenges:\n\nLimited commercial availability of sustainable-fuel-powered vehicles\n\nBased on Fuel type, the Sustainable Fuel Market is segmented into five types of fuels: Biofuels, Biomethane, Hydrogen, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and e-fuels. Among them, the Biofuels will be the largest segment. Biofuels are viewed as a greener alternative to fossil fuels, as they reduce GHG emissions significantly and contribute to climate change mitigation. This environmental benefit is a major driver of their expansion. Furthermore, biofuels help to reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels, so improving national energy security. Countries may mitigate the risks of oil price volatility and geopolitical crises by diversifying their energy sources. Furthermore, growing prices for traditional jet fuels encourage the aviation industry to look for more cost-effective and sustainable options, driving demand for aviation biofuel.\n\nMake an Inquiry:https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=68114533\n\nThis report segments the Sustainable Fuel Market based on state into 2 categories: Gas and Liquid. The gas segment is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the Sustainable Fuel Market. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, governments throughout the world are implementing stricter environmental restrictions. This legislative drive promotes the use of cleaner alternatives such as biomethane, CNG, and hydrogen, which benefits the gas category in the Sustainable Fuel Market. Furthermore, advances in gas generation, storage, and distribution technologies have considerably enhanced the efficiency and viability of renewable gases such as biomethane and hydrogen. alternative developments cut prices while increasing the usefulness of alternative fuels. Furthermore, sustainable gasses improve energy security by lowering reliance on imported fossil fuels. Diversifying the energy mix with local and renewable gas sources helps to stabilize energy supply and costs, which encourages their use.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSustainable Fuel Market is segmented into 3 categories\n\nRoad transportation: Marine Aviation.\n\nThe Road transportation segment is anticipated to grow as the largest segment in the Sustainable Fuel Market. To combat climate change and reduce carbon emissions, nations are enacting strict environmental regulations. This supports the use of cleaner fuels in road transportation, such as biofuels, biomethane, CNG, hydrogen, and e-fuels, to meet emission targets. Furthermore, continual developments in fuel technology, such as improved hydrogen fuel cells and more efficient biofuel manufacturing processes, increase the viability and performance of sustainable fuels in road transportation. These advancements reduce costs and improve fuel efficiency, making them more appealing to both consumers and businesses.\n\nRegional Insights\r\nThe Asia Pacific region is expected to record the fastest growth through 2029.\n\nGovernments are introducing incentives and mandates for sustainable aviation fuels. Collaborative efforts between governments, research institutions, and industry partners are expanding SAF infrastructure. Investments in production, distribution, and consumption infrastructure are improving SAF accessibility and affordability.\n\nRequest Sample Pages:https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=68114533\n\nNotable Developments\n\nMay 2024: TotalEnergies and SINOPEC partnered to establish a 230,000 tons-per-year SAF production unit at a SINOPEC refinery in China.

Exxon Mobil extended its 43-year dividend growth streak with a 4% hike and a 3.5% yield. Cameco and ConocoPhillips both raised payouts, with Cameco accelerating its timeline and Conoco shifting to a pure base dividend strategy. Interested in Exxon Mobil Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nThree energy behemoths are lifting their dividends\u2014a Dividend Aristocrat, a huge nuclear name, and one of the world\u2019s largest oil exploration and production companies. For income-focused investors, these moves offer compelling entry points across oil and nuclear energy, whether you're seeking yield stability, growth potential, or sector diversification.\n\nExxon Mobil Increases Dividend for 43rd Year, Offers 3.5% Yield\n\nWith a $500 billion market cap, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) is the largest energy stock in the United States, well ahead of its closest peer,\u00a0Chevron (NYSE: CVX), at $315 billion.\n\n\u2192 Why These 3 Tech Stocks Could Be the Best Opportunities You're Overlooking\n\nExxon has put up a solid 15% return in 2025, outperforming the 10% return of the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLE). However, it is still underperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 16% return.\n\nOn Oct. 31, Exxon declared a dividend of $1.03 per share, a 4% increase over its previous payout. This brings the company\u2019s streak of annual per-share dividend increases to 43 years, meaning this Dividend Aristocrat is only a few years shy of becoming a Dividend King.\n\n\u2192 Disney Stock Drops\u2014Will Earnings Pave Way for a YouTube TV Truce?\n\nExxon\u2019s latest dividend boosts its indicated yield to a very strong 3.5%. While the Nov. 14 record date has passed, shareholders can still benefit from the increased payout in future quarters, assuming Exxon maintains or raises the dividend.\n\nCameco Surprises With Early 50% Dividend Hike\n\n$37 billion nuclear energy company, Cameco's (NYSE: CCJ) McArthur River Mine is the\u00a0world\u2019s largest high-grade uranium mine, and its Key Lake facility is the world\u2019s largest uranium mill.\n\n\u2192 3 Energy Giants Amp Up Dividends\u2014Here\u2019s What It Means for Investors\n\nShares have soared in 2025, delivering a return of approximately 65%. Through the first nine months of 2025, pre-tax earnings in the company\u2019s core uranium business\u00a0are up solidly.\n\nEarnings before income taxes in this segment increased by around 11% to $681 million, compared to $615 million in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s improved financial performance, Cameco boosted its dividend by 50%, moving its annual payout to 24 cents per share\u2014a level it previously expected to reach in 2026. This dividend is payable on Dec. 16 to shareholders of record on Dec. 1.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOverall, the company\u2019s indicated yield remains low at 0.13%. However, it is still good to see that Cameco is sweetening the pot for income investors and is executing this plan faster than anticipated.\n\nConocoPhillips Raises Base Dividend But Reduces Total Payout\n\nDespite a difficult year, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) is also increasing its dividend. The company is down around\u00a06% in 2025,\u00a0making it one of the worst-performing large-cap energy stocks of the year. The firm\u2019s focus on oil exploration and production has been a significant detriment as oil prices are down significantly, putting pressure on the company\u2019s margins.\n\nOn Nov. 6, Conoco announced an 8% increase to its quarterly base dividend. Its new payout comes in at 84 cents per share, giving the stock an impressive 3.7% indicated yield. Conoco also touts its dividend growth. For the fifth year in a row, the firm\u2019s dividend growth is in the top quartile (25%) among S&P 500 stocks.\n\nHowever, this claim is somewhat misleading. It is true that the company\u2019s base dividend has increased strongly, but its total dividend payments are actually down. The company paid out $3.82 in total dividends in 2023\u2014significantly more than the $3.36 implied by its latest base dividend. This is because Conoco also used to pay a variable dividend, often when oil prices were high.\n\nGoing forward, Conoco will only pay a base dividend. Still, it plans to deliver strong dividend growth, ranking in the top quartile of S&P 500 companies. The Nov. 17 record date for this dividend has passed, but it is still available for future quarters.\n\nDividend Increases Signal Mixed Strengths Across Energy Sectors\n\nRising dividends from Exxon, Cameco, and ConocoPhillips highlight three distinct plays for income investors: steady, blue-chip reliability; early-stage nuclear growth; and high-yield oil exposure. Whether you\u2019re building a resilient income stream or positioning for long-term sector trends, these increases offer timely entry points\u2014and a reminder that in energy, cash flow still speaks loudest.\n\nThe article \"3 Energy Giants Amp Up Dividends\u2014Here\u2019s What It Means for Investors\" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-energy-giants-amp-dividends-183600622.html", "symbols": ["CCJ.US", "CCO.TO", "COP.US", "CVX.US", "XLE.US", "XOM.US"], "tags": ["DIVIDEND PAYMENTS", "DIVIDENDS", "ENERGY", "INCOME-INVESTING", "NUCLEAR-ENERGY"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.013, "neu": 0.85, "pos": 0.138}}, {"date": "2025-11-17T17:47:25+00:00", "title": "Market Chatter: Chevron Explores Purchase of Lukoil Assets", "content": "Chevron (CVX) is exploring the purchase of some global assets from the sanctioned Russian oil compan\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription?

Despite a low payout ratio of 3.1%, dividends are not well covered by free cash flows, with a high cash payout ratio of 93.6%.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this oil company have returned +3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, to which Chevron belongs, has gained 7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Chevron is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share, indicating a change of -23.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.32 points to a change of -27.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.07 indicates a change of +10.3% from what Chevron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chevron is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CVX\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Chevron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $54.87 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $192.48 billion and $206.88 billion estimates indicate -5.1% and +7.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nChevron reported revenues of $49.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $2.51 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $53.58 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.18%. The EPS surprise was +11.45%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Chevron surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nChevron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chevron.
