Investors recently switched lanes from inflation concerns to outright recession fears after a stream of weak economic data followed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision to hold interest rates steady until September. While nobody knows what the market or the economy will do in the future, volatility returned to the markets and could make things a bit bumpy over the coming months.\n\nInvestors began flocking to defensive investments, including stocks of recession-resistant businesses.\n\nThese three blue chip stocks should perform better than most in a volatile market. They pay great dividends and have durable long-term growth prospects.\n\nConfidently buy and hold these names for the next 20 years.\n\nMonthly dividends to pay your bills\n\nRealty Income(NYSE: O) is poised to benefit from lower interest rates. Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT); it acquires and leases real estate and distributes its taxable income to shareholders as dividends. Realty Income stands out for a few reasons. First, the company focuses on single-tenant retail properties, such as renting to businesses like convenience stores, grocery stores, movie theaters, and more. These tenants are all recession-resistant businesses that pay dependable rent. Second, Realty Income signs net leases, meaning the tenant is responsible for maintenance, taxes, and insurance expenses. As a result, Realty Income's rental income is very predictable.\n\nNext, Realty Income pays a monthly dividend, which is rare for U.S. companies. The dividends add up to approximately $3.16 per share, a 5.3% yield at the current price. Realty Income has also raised its dividend yearly since going public, a 31-year streak. This includes raising the payouts during economic crises like the financial meltdown of 2008-2009 and the pandemic of 2020. Realty Income is genuinely battle-tested and continues to pay an ever-increasing dividend.\n\nThe stock has underperformed the market due to high interest rates; REITs like Realty Income borrow to fund growth, so high interest rates negatively impact their business. That trend could now reverse as the FOMC cuts rates. The stock trades at just 14 times its funds from operations (REIT earnings), an attractive valuation for a high-yielder with a proven long-term growth resume.\n\nPeople won't stop buying groceries\n\nFood and beverages are a no-brainer for long-term investors. Companies like PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) may not set the world ablaze with growth, but slow-and-steady expansion has fueled durable investment returns for decades. PepsiCo sells its namesake soda but, in reality, is a conglomerate of food and beverage brands, including Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Quaker, Frito Lay, Doritos, Cheetos, and many more. You'll find PepsiCo's products throughout grocery stores worldwide, which makes it hard for the company to have a down year.\n\nGiven that context, it's no shocker that PepsiCo is a magnificent dividend stock. PepsiCo is a Dividend King, with over five decades of consecutive dividend growth. The stock offers an excellent combination of income and upside due to its current 3% yield and five-year annualized dividend growth rate between 6% and 7%. PepsiCo pays about 66% of its earnings out as dividends, leaving enough cushion for PepsiCo to invest in growth or endure an unexpected slump.\n\nWhile PepsiCo is recession-resistant, management has noted that consumers have resisted price increases. As a result, the stock has dipped to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 22 versus its five-year average of 26. The stock seems fairly valued today (not too expensive, but not cheap). Investors looking for a long-term stalwart that can deliver slow and steady growth should consider PepsiCo a stock they can trust.\n\nThe leader in next-generation nicotine products\n\nTobacco isn't a dead industry yet but is clearly in slow decline. Philip Morris International(NYSE: PM) has established itself as a market leader in next-generation nicotine products, which feature smokeless offerings like vaping and heated tobacco devices, as well as oral nicotine pouches. Philip Morris began its journey to next-generation products in 2014 with IQOS and has built these innovations into a significant portion of the business. Today, IQOS and oral nicotine brand Zyn are fueling growth as management milks the cigarette business for profits with steady price increases.\n\nThis revived growth has Philip Morris poised to shower investors with cash over the coming decades. The stock is already a high-yielder, with a starting yield of 4.4%. Additionally, the payout should grow nicely since analysts believe the company will grow earnings at a high-single-digit pace over the long term. Organic smoke-free product revenue grew over 18% year-over-year in Q2, which shows just how much momentum these next-generation products have. Philip Morris is a growing business again despite the secular decline in smoking.\n\nThe stock is more expensive than in recent years; shares trade at a P/E of 18 versus a five-year average of 17. However, the company's growth, strong position with next-generation nicotine products, and high starting dividend yield seem enough to justify a long-term investor scooping up shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them.

That way, I won\u2019t have to worry about financial stability and can improve my total return, as stock market weakness usually causes dividends to become a much bigger driver of total returns. \n\nIn addition to undervalued players in healthcare and consumer staples like Merck (MRK [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK]), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ]), and PepsiCo (PEP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP]), I like the REIT and midstream space, which are the two best examples of predictable cash flows.\n\nSafe net lease players like Realty Income (O [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O]), NNN REIT (NNN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NNN]), and Essential Properties Trust (EPRT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPRT]) should do especially well on a relative basis. In midstream, I like ONEOK (OKE [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE]), Antero Midstream (AM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AM]), Kinder Morgan (KMI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMI]), and Canadian players like TC Energy (TRP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRP]) and Enbridge (ENB [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENB]). All of these companies are C-Corps. In the MLP space, I prefer Western Midstream (WES [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WES]) and MPLX (MPLX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPLX]) over everyone else.\n\nRoberts Berzins [https://seekingalpha.com/author/roberts-berzins-cfa]: Given the record highs of largest indices (SPY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY]) (QQQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ]) and the overall excitement about the potential productivity gains from the AI, it would be only prudent to add a bit of defense in the portfolio.\n\nBy defense I mean concrete picks, which are uncorrelated to the AI stocks, like high-quality, long-duration REITs, such as in the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (VNQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ]). The premise here is that if the AI-concentrated market starts to plunge, the long-term Treasury yields should go up. And if the economy fell into recession, odds would be high that the Fed would embark on quantitative easing, which is also positive for Treasury yields.\n\nFor REITs like Realty Income (O [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O]), this is exactly what is needed to drive up valuations, given the inherently high-duration factors that stem from long-term, relatively fixed leases. Plus, by deploying capital into O, investors would be able to access an attractive dividend yield of 5.6% that is underpinned by an upper investment grade balance sheet and cash flows that are desynchronized from the AI play.\n\nMORE ON SPDR S&P 500 ETF TRUST, INVESCO QQQ TRUST ETF, ETC.\n\n \t* The AI Bubble Hangover: Distinguishing The Revolution From The Ruin [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846299-the-ai-bubble-hangover-distinguishing-the-revolution-from-the-ruin]\n \t* The Tardy September Jobs Report Shows Overall Weakness [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846276-the-tardy-september-jobs-report-shows-overall-weakness]\n \t* Cracks Are Developing In The 'Everything' Bubble [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846260-cracks-developing-in-the-everything-bubble]\n \t* Wall Street's slide likely driven by signals in crypto - Fundstrat's Lee, IBKR's Sosnick [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524686-wall-streets-slide-likely-driven-by-signals-in-crypto---fundstrats-lee-ibkrs-sosnick]\n \t* Volatility spikes to a one month high as market sentiment shifts sour [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524592-volatility-spikes-to-a-one-month-high-as-market-sentiment-shifts-sour]\n\n ", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524699-sa-what-are-the-best-defensive-stocks-right-now?utm_source=feed_news_all&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;feed_item_type=news", "symbols": ["AM.US", "ENB.US", "EPRT.US", "JNJ.US", "KMI.US", "MPLX.US", "MRK.US", "NNN.US", "O.US", "OKE.US", "PEP.US"], "tags": ["BALANCE SHEET", "CONSUMER", "CONSUMER-STAPLES", "CONSUMER\u00a0", "DEFENSIVE-STOCKS", "DIVIDENDS", "ENERGY\u00a0", "FINANCIALS", "FINANCIALS\u00a0", "HEALTHCARE\u00a0", "MIDSTREAM", "REITS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.037, "neu": 0.812, "pos": 0.151}}, {"date": "2025-11-22T07:08:10+00:00", "title": "A Fresh Look at PepsiCo (PEP) Valuation Following Recent Financial Results", "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) recently reported its annual financial results, drawing attention to its revenue and net income growth for the year.

The initiative promotes practices such as cover cropping, composting, and the use of biological inputs to regenerate soil health, strengthen climate resilience, and reduce dependency on synthetic inputs. The project takes place in a key agricultural area that accounts for nearly 60% of Brazil's soybean and corn production.\n\nThe shared goal is to restore ecosystems, improve farmer profitability, and enhance climate resilience across two crops critical to the local agricultural economy and food supply chains. Through this work, Griffith Foods reinforces its purpose of \"Blending Care and Creativity to Nourish the World\" by co-creating science-based, innovative, and regenerative solutions.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"At Griffith Foods, we see this partnership as part of our journey to nourish the world and transform the food system. Guided by our 2030 Aspirations, we're turning that vision into action-moving beyond \u2018do no harm' thinking to embrace a regenerative mindset that restores soils, strengthens communities, and proves that business can be a true vehicle for greater good\" said Nicholas Costa, Regional Sustainability Director for Central and South America at Griffith Foods.\n\nThis project also introduces an innovative \"Payment for Practices\" and \"Payment for Outcomes\" model, which rewards both the adoption of regenerative techniques (such as cover crops, composting, and bio inputs) and the measurable results in emissions reduction.\n\n\"This program tackles the biggest barrier to regenerative agriculture: the financial risk farmers face when transitioning to new practices,\" said Thais Souza, Global Procurement Manager - ESG at PepsiCo Brazil. \"By providing direct economic incentives, we're enabling behavior change that improves soil health, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and builds climate resilience.\"\n\nCosta added that this and other initiatives are part of Griffith Foods' 2030 Aspirations- an ambitious global plan to nourish the world sustainably through three key pillars: building sustainable food system networks, developing a nutritious and sustainable portfolio, and creating new markets to serve the underserved.\n\nAcross its regenerative agriculture initiatives, Griffith Foods currently has nearly 30,000 acres (approximately 12,000 hectares) in transition across projects in Canada, Colombia, the United Kingdom, and Thailand, fostering practices that restore ecosystems and strengthen rural livelihoods. Through these and related programs, the company continues to promote inclusive and sustainable agricultural development in partnership with local producers, suppliers, and organizations worldwide. In parallel, Griffith Foods continues to strengthen its commitment to nutrition and innovation, with 56% of its global portfolio meeting external nutrition standards and numerous value chain projects underway in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.\n\nFor Griffith Foods, innovation and sustainability are the path to transforming food systems. In line with this commitment, the company will continue strengthening projects with industry partners to advance shared value models that foster environmental regeneration and community well-being, fulfilling its purpose of Blending Care and Creativity to Nourish the World.\n\nAbout Griffith Foods\n\nGriffith Foods is a global product development partner helping food companies meet the evolving needs of consumers with high-quality, culinary driven, customized products.

Investors are worried about debt levels and volume growth. The stock isn\u2019t a lost cause, but an earnest rebound could take time to materialize. 10 stocks we like better than PepsiCo \u203a\n\nFor all the talk about the wind possibly coming out of the sails of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, a real sector rotation hasn't played out.\n\nRecent headlines suggest investors are skittish about what the near term holds for growth and technology stocks. Such jitters often compel market participants to move into defensive sectors, but broadly speaking, consumer staples stocks -- a defensive group to be sure -- aren't responding.PepsiCo's stock is slumping. A rebound, though possible, could take some time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDown 2.16% year to date, the stock of PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) is one of the Consumer Staples sector's disappointments. Making PepsiCo's lethargy even harder to swallow for investors is that rival Coca-Cola is up more than 14% in 2025 and keeping up with the S&P 500 in the process. Combine those factors, and it might be hard to be bullish on the Gatorade maker, but there's a case for a rebound if the company can allay shareholders' concerns on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, the bad news for PepsiCo\n\nOne strike against PepsiCo is that its debt levels have grown much more rapidly than those of Coca-Cola. At the end of the third quarter, PepsiCo carried long-term debt of $44.13 billion, a 14.61% year-over-year increase, extending a lengthy run during which its liabilities ballooned faster than its competitors.Data by YCharts.\n\nStrike two is the fact that PepsiCo's 2025 organic sales growth has been anemic, and global volumes have declined in each of the first three quarters of the year. One way of looking at those trends, at least as they relate to the U.S., is that at a time when some shoppers view the Consumer Price Index\u00a0as still being elevated, the company can't price its way into revenue growth.\n\nStrike three is more of an interesting fact. PepsiCo is no longer on the podium of the most popular sodas. That's right: not even a bronze medal as Coca-Cola Classic, Dr. Pepper, and Coke's Sprite are the medalists, with PepsiCo ranking fourth in popularity. As someone who grew up during the cola wars of the 1980s, this is stunning.\n\nHow PepsiCo can get its groove back\n\nOne of the investment cases for PepsiCo, although the news is priced into the stock, is the involvement of Elliott Investment Management, which took a $4 billion stake in the company in September. The stock hasn't done much of anything since then, but know this: Activist investors don't get involved unless they sense an opportunity to come out on top.\n\nStory Continues\n\nElliott has made clear it wants PepsiCo to spin off its North American bottling operations -- something Coca-Cola has already done -- and perhaps prune its sprawling brand portfolio. In theory, PepsiCo retaining its North American bottling unit is sensible because it gives it control over the process, but the reality is much different. In the soda margin fight, Coca-Cola comes out far ahead because it doesn't bottle its own drinks.\n\nThe brand-paring option has some viability as well because PepsiCo controls 60 brands, according to its website. By parting ways with a few, it could streamline its operations, raise cash to lower debt, and simplify its investment story.\n\nReducing debt is always a good thing. Less cash going out the door to service liabilities means more capital retained to grow the business and support the company's membership in the Dividend Kings club, which it earned through its history of more than 50 consecutive years of annual dividend hikes. It's one of the primary reasons some investors stick with the stock.\n\nShould you buy stock in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

CELH recently announced a new $300 million share repurchase authorization, signaling strong confidence in its financial position and long-term fundamentals. The company noted that solid cash generation and a healthy balance sheet give it sufficient flexibility to make share repurchases while continuing to invest in its multi-brand energy portfolio.\r\n\r\nThe announcement follows a robust third-quarter 2025 show, in which revenues surged 173% year over year, driven by the Alani Nu and Rockstar acquisitions and continued growth in the Celsius brand. CELH ended the quarter with nearly $806 million in cash, supported by strong operating cash flow and a healthy liquidity position despite an active acquisition year. Gross margin expanded 530 basis points to 51.3%, providing additional internal funding capacity.\r\n\r\nBalance-sheet flexibility also improved. Following quarter-end, CELH reduced debt by $200 million, lowering total debt to about $700 million and cutting its term loan rate by 75 basis points, which is expected to reduce annual interest expense by about $20 million starting in 2026.\r\n\r\nWhile the fourth quarter of 2025 is expected to be uneven due to the timing of Alani Nu\u2019s transition into PepsiCo, Inc.\u2019s PEP DSD network, CELH\u2019s underlying performance remains healthy. Against this backdrop of strong cash reserves, expanding margins and ongoing debt reduction, Celsius Holdings\u2019 decision to authorize a $300 million buyback reflects confidence in its long-term earnings trajectory and its ability to balance growth investments with shareholder returns.\n\nHow PEP & MNST\u2019s Buybacks Signal Strength\n\nPepsiCo expects to return nearly $8.6 billion to its shareholders in 2025, through share buybacks of $1.0 billion and dividends of $7.6 billion, per its third-quarter earnings release. This underscores that buybacks are a deliberate part of the company\u2019s capital allocation, courtesy of its healthy liquidity position. PepsiCo\u2019s net cash from operating activities amounted to $5,468 million for the 36 weeks ended Sept. 6, 2025.\r\n\r\nMonster Beverage MNST delivered a strong third quarter, with net sales rising 16.8% to $2.20 billion and net income growing 41.4% to $524.5 million. While the company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, it has approximately $500 million remaining under its authorized buyback program.

The fund's holdings offer high yields and have an excellent record of increasing their dividend payments. The ETF has also delivered high total returns for investors over the years. 10 stocks we like better than Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF \u203a\n\nGenerating passive income is a big part of my investment strategy. It provides me with more cash to invest and helps me become more financially independent.\n\nI've found that investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a great way to complement my passive income investment strategy. One of my favorite ETFs to buy for income is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD). Here's why I plan to buy even more of the high-yield ETF this November.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA simple way to invest in 100 top dividend stocks\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks an index (the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index) that measures the performance of 100 of the highest-quality dividend stocks. It screens companies based on several dividend quality characteristics, including dividend yield and five-year dividend growth rate. It also selects companies based on their financial strength compared to their peers.\n\nThe fund's holdings have an average yield approaching 4% and have grown their payouts at a more than 8% compound annual rate over the past five years.As a result, it provides investors with a nice current income stream that steadily rises, a great combo for those seeking to generate passive income. At its current annualized dividend rate, I can generate nearly $40 of annual passive income from every $1,000 I invest in the fund.\n\nThe cream of the dividend income crop\n\nThe ETF holds a who's who of elite dividend stocks. For example, one of its top ten holdings is PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). The beverage and snacking giant's dividend currently yields 3.9%, well above the S&P 500's 1.2% yield. The company generates lots of durable cash flow to support its dividend and also has a strong balance sheet. PepsiCo has increased its dividend for 53 straight years, qualifying it as a Dividend King, a company with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases. The iconic company has grown its dividend at an impressive 7.5% compound annual rate since 2010.\n\nThe fund's top 10 holdings feature several other high-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks. Notable names include Coca-Cola (2.9% current yield and 63 consecutive years of dividend increases), Chevron (4.5% current yield and 38 years of dividend growth), and Verizon (7.7% current yield and 19 straight years of dividend increases). In essence, the fund enables investors to hold a diversified portfolio of some of the world's best higher-yielding dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIncome growth and attractive total return potential\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF provides investors like me with more than just an attractive current passive income stream. The fund doesn't just hold high-yielding dividend stocks; it holds companies that steadily increase their payments. As a result, the income stream provided by this ETF steadily increases: SCHD Dividend data by YCharts\n\nThat growth has two notable benefits. Investors collect more income each year. Additionally, they benefit from value appreciation. As the underlying companies grow their earnings and increase their dividends, their share prices tend to rise accordingly. That combination of income and price appreciation provides investors with a high total return.\n\nSince its inception in 2011, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has produced an 11.6% average annual total return.It has also delivered a more than 10% average annualized total return over the past three-, five-, and 10-year periods.\n\nPassive income and more\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is a perfect fund to buy for passive income. It offers a high-yielding income stream backed by 100 of the world's best dividend stocks. These companies also have excellent track records of increasing their dividends and shareholder value. As a result, investors will collect an attractive and steadily rising stream of income while also growing their wealth. Those features are why I'm buying even more of this top high-yield ETF in November.\n\nShould you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

See what our analysts have to say in our full research report, it\u2019s free for active Edge members.\n\nWhy Is PepsiCo Not Exciting?\n\nWe don't have much confidence in PepsiCo. Here are three reasons you should be careful with PEP and a stock we'd rather own.\n\n1. Demand Slipping as Sales Volumes Decline\n\nRevenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (the number of units sold). While both are important, volume is the lifeblood of a successful staples business as there\u2019s a ceiling to what consumers will pay for everyday goods; they can always trade down to non-branded products if the branded versions are too expensive.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s average quarterly sales volumes have shrunk by 2.3% over the last two years. This decrease isn\u2019t ideal because the quantity demanded for consumer staples products is typically stable.PepsiCo Year-On-Year Volume Growth\n\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Slim\n\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite.\n\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect PepsiCo\u2019s revenue to rise by 3.8%, close to This projection is underwhelming and indicates its newer products will not catalyze better top-line performance yet.\n\n3. Shrinking Operating Margin\n\nOperating margin is a key profitability metric because it accounts for all expenses enabling a business to operate smoothly, including marketing and advertising, IT systems, wages, and other administrative costs.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, PepsiCo\u2019s operating margin decreased by 2.4 percentage points over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Its operating margin for the trailing 12 months was 11%.PepsiCo Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. That said, the stock currently trades at 17.5\u00d7 forward P/E (or $146.70 per share). This valuation is reasonable, but the company\u2019s shakier fundamentals present too much downside risk. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now.

After a period of margin pressure caused by inflation, higher global input costs and ongoing supply-chain volatility, management is sharpening execution to rebuild profitability. The company has been clear that right-sizing its entire cost base, through automation, SKU rationalization, labor restructuring and network simplification, will be the financial engine that fuels a faster, innovation-led growth trajectory. With International continuing to deliver resilient mid-single-digit organic growth and North America showing early signs of stabilization, PepsiCo is positioning 2025 as a reset year built on disciplined operational tightening.\r\n\r\nA major part of PepsiCo\u2019s plan is boosting productivity. The company has cut more than 35% of SKUs, reduced 7% of Frito-Lay\u2019s workforce and is shutting some plants, consolidating distribution and using AI to simplify operations. These steps are lowering costs and improving efficiency, helping PepsiCo offset higher ingredient and tariff expenses that recently caused a three-point margin drag. With more cuts ahead, including another 15% SKU reduction in the fourth quarter, the company sees a clearer path to strengthening margins across its beverage and snack businesses.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, PepsiCo is leaning heavily on a stronger pipeline of new products, from functional drinks to clean-label snacks, to drive higher-value growth. The momentum of Pepsi Zero Sugar, the fast rise of poppi and launches like Pepsi Prebiotic and Gatorade Lower Sugar show the company\u2019s shift toward more permissible, health-focused categories. PepsiCo believes that pairing strict cost savings with this innovation push can reignite growth, especially in North America, where PBNA is aiming for a mid-teens operating margin. Whether these efforts can fully restore margins will determine the strength of its 2025 rebound.\n\nAre KO & KDP Turning Cost Cuts Into Fuel for Innovation?\n\nBoth The Coca-Cola Company KO and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP are using cost-cutting efforts to create financial flexibility, allowing them to reinvest in innovation and strengthen their growth pipelines.\r\n\r\nFor Coca-Cola, disciplined cost control is helping fuel a more innovation-driven portfolio refresh. KO has already delivered strong margin expansion, and its savings from supply-chain efficiencies, smarter marketing allocation and productivity programs are giving it room to invest in new categories and premium offerings. Coca-Cola is channeling these funds into zero-sugar growth, expanded flavor innovation and functional beverages, while continuing to modernize legacy brands. With operating margin rising sharply in the latest quarter, KO is proving that cost discipline can directly support innovation and drive both profitability and long-term growth.\r\n\r\nKeurig is also relying on cost savings to support innovation-led growth, especially as margins remain pressured by lingering inflation.

Dividend Kings are excellent choices for investors who prioritize dividend reliability, and these five may appeal to value investors. 10 stocks we like better than PepsiCo \u203a\n\nA 4% dividend yield isn't much when the S&P 500 is on track to gain over 15% for the third consecutive year. But generating a stable and growing stream of passive income can be an excellent way to supplement retirement income or achieve a financial planning goal without relying on rising stock prices.\n\nYet, dividends are only as reliable as the companies paying them. So companies that combine an extensive track record of dividend growth with a high yield are elite choices for income investors.\n\nThere are only 56 or so Dividend Kings -- which are companies that have boosted their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years. Here are five Dividend Kings that are down 5% to 33% year to date to buy in November.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe consumer staples sector is getting crushed\n\nDividend Kings PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG), Colgate-Palmolive(NYSE: CL), Kimberly-Clark(NASDAQ: KMB), and Target (NYSE: TGT) have gradually expanded over the decades, growing their earnings and, in turn, the amount they directly pay shareholders through cash dividends.\n\nHowever, all five of these Dividend Kings are down big in 2025. In fact, consumer staples is the worst-performing sector year to date. Consumers have been hit hard by rising costs of living, inflationary pressures, mounting credit card debt, relatively high interest rates, and now a weakening job market.^IXT data by YCharts\n\nThese factors have reduced foot traffic at Target and impacted demand for Pepsi's snacks (under the Lay's and Quaker Oats brands) and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as household and personal products owned by P&G, Colgate, and Kimberly-Clark.\n\nBut there's good reason to think better times may lay ahead for each of the companies.\n\nNavigating the slowdown\n\nPepsiCo\n\nTo overcome this period of sluggish growth, Pepsi is working on a portfolio transformation and cost reductions to improve its operations, especially in its supply chain, and responding to increased interest in wellness and healthy snacks. Many of Pepsi's recent acquisitions don't overlap with its existing salty snacks and soda brands.\n\nOver the past year, Pepsi acquired full ownership of the companies that make Sabra and Obela products (emphasis on Mediterranean-inspired dips and spreads), Siete Foods (Mexican-American food products such as sauces, seasonings, and snacks), and prebiotic and juice brand Poppi -- which is perhaps the biggest portfolio diversification for Pepsi in years.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThese moves should help Pepsi adapt to changing consumer preferences without damaging its existing brands.\n\nProcter & Gamble\n\nP&G continues to exhibit impeccable pricing power and is forecasting modest earnings growth. The company's international exposure and leading brands across several key categories allow the company to offset weakness in one segment with growth in another.\n\nRight now, its overall skin care business and multiple product categories in Greater China and Latin America are producing solid results, which is helping offset a slowdown in North America.\n\nColgate-Palmolive\n\nUnlike P&G, which is well-diversified across several consumer categories, Colgate is mainly an oral and home care products company. The Colgate brand is a global leader in toothpaste and toothbrushes.\n\nThe brand is immensely valuable, as Colgate is known for its ultra-high operating margin and return on invested capital. Colgate also owns Hill's Pet Nutrition, which is arguably its second-most-valuable brand, behind Colgate. The segment is high-margin and accounted for a whopping 22.6% of Colgate's net sales for the nine months ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn this vein, Colgate is one of the most reliable consumer staples companies because its portfolio is built around a few leading brands.\n\nKimberly-Clark\n\nKimberly-Clark has gotten hammered as of late, with the stock now hovering around a 10-year low.^SPX data by YCharts\n\nInvestors reacted negatively to the company's $48.7 billion deal to acquire Kenvue. The acquisition comes just a little over two years after Kenvue completed its separation from Johnson & Johnson -- forming an independent company focusing on consumer health through leading brands like Band-Aid, Johnson's, Listerine, Neutrogena, Aveeno, and Tylenol.\n\nPart of the negative reaction may be due to claims linking Tylenol usage and autism, as well as cancer claims linked to its baby powder products. Additionally, Kimberly-Clark is a paper products company that produces toilet paper, paper towels, tissues, diapers, adult care, and feminine care products, which is completely different from Kenvue's product portfolio.\n\nWith so much going wrong, it's easy to lose sight of the company's strengths. Kimberly-Clark owns Huggies, which is right up there with P&G-owned Pampers as the leading brands in the diaper category. Its Kleenex brand is the leading facial tissue in the world. Scott is a top paper towel and toilet paper brand, and Cottonelle is a leading toilet paper brand.\n\nKenvue also has many category-leading brands. And a key similarity between Kimberly Clark and Kenvue is that demand for many of their categories tends to hold up well, even during a recession, making Kimberly Clark a highly intriguing value stock for patient investors to consider.\n\nTarget\n\nTarget can't compete on value with Walmart, Costco Wholesale, or Amazon. Or on grocery prices. Its slight premium across product categories is leading to pressure on sales and margins.\n\nHowever, Target is turning its business around by playing to its strengths -- such as improving the in-store experience, exclusive partnerships, and e-commerce. Even with declining growth, Target still generates substantially more free cash flow and earnings than is needed to pay its dividend.\n\nThese Dividend Kings are dirt cheap\n\nThe sell-off across these consumer staples names has pushed their yields up above historic averages and their valuations down -- offering a compelling cost basis for long-term investors.PEP PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Pepsi, P&G, and Colgate, in particular, tend to command premium valuations due to their high-quality portfolios. But all three of those stocks fetch highly attractive valuations based on forward earnings projections.\n\nKimberly-Clark trades at the steepest discount to its historical average, but that valuation should be taken with a grain of salt considering earnings will change dramatically once the acquisition of Kenvue goes through.\n\nFive regal ways to boost your passive income stream\n\nWith valuations of many top stocks elevated, investors may want to consider adding shares of quality companies priced for what they are already earning rather than what they could earn years down the line.\n\nInvestors looking for high-margin cash cows may want to focus mainly on P&G and Colgate-Palmolive. Pepsi and Target are compelling turnaround plays, and Kimberly-Clark is arguably the best deep value stock of the bunch.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP and Monster Beverage Corp. MNST.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nBuilding the scenario for the Zacks Bull of the Day, broader valuation concerns have stemmed from the tech sector, with the market also on edge about delayed inflation data due to what was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the market\u2019s ability and willingness to sift out and reward economic processes has been temporarily delayed with fears of an AI bubble adding to the willingness connotation.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, how about buying a medical stock that is already seeing strong momentum but is still cheaply valued?\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This could provide a defensive hedge against any further economic uncertainty, while and when inflation data gets sorted out, especially if it's unfavorable, along with addressing the \u201ccorrection\u201d the market appears to be asking for by pivoting to a value stock.\n\nCollegium Pharmaceutical fits this strategic selection as an attractively valued Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock with the essential operations that investors often seek during market volatility, and the potentially lucrative profitability that successful biopharmaceutical companies can earn, i.e., momentum.\n\nAbout Collegium and its Recent Stock Performance\n\nDeveloping prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, Collegium is focused on pain management drugs that have an abuse-deterrent formulation, with its treatments also spanning to respiratory and skin-related disorders.\n\nAttributing to its improved margins and profitability, Collegium benefits from high-value branded drugs that are protected by patents or exclusivity periods. These include pain drug brands such as Belbuca and Nucynta, along with Xtampza ER (extended-release oxycodone), which has an exclusivity period through 2029.\n\nCollegium stock has ascended to new multi-year highs upon exceeding earnings expectations in each of its last four quarterly reports. COLL is currently trading near multi-year highs of around $45 a share and is up nearly +60% year to date.\n\nCollegium\u2019s Impressive Net Income Margins\n\nMagnifying Collegium\u2019s earnings potential has been its impressive net income margins. As shown below, Collegium has maintained a net margin of around 8.56% in the last five years (Median), with an eye-catching high of 32.73%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn comparison, Collegium\u2019s Zacks Medical-Drugs Industry\u2019s median net income average is at 4.53% during this period, and is only at 1.1% at the moment. To that point, most biopharmaceutical companies generate high-product-level profitability (gross margins) but spend heavily on operating costs, especially as it relates to R&D.\n\nWhy COLL Still Looks Cheap\n\nDespite a sharp YTD rally, Collegium stock still trades at just 6X forward earnings, offering a sharp discount to the benchmark S&P 500 and its Zacks industry average of 18X.\n\nEven better, EPS revisions are nicely up since Collegium exceeded Q3 expectations earlier in the month and raised its full-year revenue guidance.\n\nIn the last 30 days, FY25 EPS revisions have gone from $7.08 to $7.55. Furthermore, this would reflect 17% growth from EPS of $6.45 last year. And although FY27 EPS is projected to dip to $7.40, estimates are up from $6.88 per share a month ago.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCollegium is taking advantage of what has been respectable and steady sales growth, which correlates with a constant demand for health products and services. Recent market jitters suggest the smart money could start to favor such medical stocks as a defensive hedge amid valuation concerns and data setbacks that have shifted the Fed\u2019s easing cycle into a holding pattern.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nSemiconductor-related stocks have taken the brunt of the pullback in correlation with AI bubble fears, and Entegris has been one to avoid in particular.\n\nProviding materials management solutions for microelectronic and semiconductor producers, the valuation for ENTG has become more reasonable, but the trend of declining earnings estimate revisions suggests more downside risk as Entegris deals with industry-related headwinds that are specific to its operations.\n\nCorrelating with such, Entegris stock has dropped 20% this month and currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.\n\nEntegris\u2019 Cautious Outlook\n\nThe extended selloff in ENTG comes as Entegris issued somewhat weak revenue guidance for Q4 that came short of analyst expectations and suggests up to a 5% sequential decrease from the $807.1 million the company brought in last quarter.\n\nAlthough Q4 revenue targets still call for double-digit growth from a year ago, Entegris has grappled with margin compression due to tariffs and weaker U.S. sales to China.\n\nCoreWeave\u2019s Data Center Delay\n\nAdding to geopolitical trade tensions that are impacting Entegris\u2019 outlook is that industry-wide pressures have mounted after AI cloud provider CoreWeave recently announced a data center delay that triggered concerns across the semiconductor supply chain.\n\nAs a materials provider, Entegris has been caught in the downturn along with other companies in the semiconductor ecosystem, such as Arm Holdings, Micron Technology and Lam Research.\n\nDeclining EPS Revisions\n\nUnfortunately, the short-term volatility in Entegris stock is likely to persist as fiscal 2025 and FY26 EPS estimates have dropped 3% and 8% in the last 30 days, respectively.\n\nOn top of this, its top and bottom line growth prospects aren\u2019t as spectacular in terms of the expansion potential for the broader AI trade.\r\n\r\nBottom Line\n\nWith its stock falling 35% from a 52-week high of $112 a share, the short-term headwinds that Entegris may continue to face are unfortunately a reason why some AI bubble fears are realistic, especially for companies that aren\u2019t direct developers of the technology.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nCan Coca-Cola's \"All Weather\" Strategy Keep Earnings Bubbling?\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d strategy is designed to keep its earnings growing steadily, irrespective of economic cycles, weather patterns or shifting consumer trends. This strategy focuses on reducing volatility in demand, strengthening pricing power and deepening global reach.\n\nKO\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d strategy is a multifaceted approach aimed at sustaining steady beverage consumption in a year, reducing its reliance on seasonal demand patterns. The strategy also covers how KO manages its supply chain, using several sources for key ingredients, and how it operates day-to-day, using tools like trade discounts to steady demand and keep distributors involved.\n\nBy balancing its portfolio across geographies and segments, the company positions itself to perform consistently and deliver growth even in the shifting market conditions. Its highly diversified portfolio, including low-sugar options, sparkling waters, premium beverages, and functional drinks, significantly expands its presence beyond the traditional soda category.\n\nCoca-Cola has shifted to a lighter, more efficient operating setup by refranchising its bottling operations, driving efficiency gains and strengthening free cash flow. This provides greater capacity to invest in marketing, product innovation and sustainability initiatives without compromising shareholder returns. In fact, KO\u2019s global franchise system remains a key competitive advantage.\n\nCurrently, the company is executing its \u201call-weather\u201d strategy to navigate the complex operating backdrop. At its core, Coca-Cola\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d strategy helps it offset the impact of unseasonal weather and rising inflation, volatile trade conditions and an evolving geopolitical backdrop. As a result, this positions the company to deliver sustained growth and stronger earnings ahead.\n\nKO\u2019s Competition: PEP & MNST in Focus\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Monster Beverage Corp. are the beverage companies competing with Coca-Cola.\n\nPepsiCo continues to emphasize value leadership by offering a sturdy balance of affordability, innovation and brand equity across its beverage and snacks portfolio. PEP leverages broad distribution strength across traditional retail, convenience, e-commerce and foodservice to deliver strong value visibility at multiple price points. PepsiCo\u2019s focus on productivity and digital transformation remains a cornerstone of its long-term strategy to enhance efficiency, fund innovation and support margin expansion.\n\nMonster Beverage leads the market by delivering strong consumer value and maintaining share in key price segments. Monster Beverage continues to uphold its value leadership in the global energy drinks category, supported by sustained brand equity, strategic innovation and disciplined pricing. The company\u2019s balanced approach to product mix and promotional investments has helped it defend market share and deliver consistent growth, even amid competitive and inflationary pressures. MNST continues to review opportunities for higher prices, domestically and internationally.\n\nKO\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nShares of Coca-Cola have gained 13.8% year to date compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 6.5%.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, KO trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.15X compared with the industry\u2019s average of 17.87X.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for KO\u2019s 2025 and 2026 earnings per share (EPS) implies year-over-year growth of 3.5% and 8%, respectively. The estimates for 2025 and 2026 have increased a penny in the past 30 days.\n\nCoca-Cola stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In 2025, U.S. beer consumption softened more sharply than historical trends, pressured by macro factors such as inflation, tariffs and strain on lower-income consumers \u2014 segments that disproportionately drive mainstream beer purchases. Against this backdrop, Molson Coors\u2019 core brands, including Coors Light and Miller Lite, have faced heightened competitive pressure and shifting consumer behavior, with fewer buyers and reduced spending per trip.\n\nTo counter these headwinds, Molson Coors is taking a renewed, more aggressive approach to revitalize its core portfolio. The company is increasing marketing investment in flagship brands, launching fresh campaigns and deepening partnerships in high-visibility arenas like sports and music.\n\nThe strategy also includes sharpening execution in local markets, recognizing that different regions respond differently to pricing, brand messaging and promotional activity. Additionally, TAP is leaning into the momentum of Coors Banquet, a standout performer with strong brand resonance, while working to narrow its distribution gap with Coors Light.\n\nMolson Coors is rebalancing its portfolio with a stronger focus on economy brands that remain critical in a strained consumer environment. By improving discipline around pricing, innovation and regional activation for brands like Miller High Life and Keystone Light, the company aims to shore up share in the segments where much of the recent softness has originated.\n\nOverall, while the beer slowdown presents real challenges, Molson Coors\u2019 combination of targeted investment, commercial realignment and renewed attention to its core and economy offerings sets the stage for stabilization, and potentially a return to growth, once macro pressures ease.\n\nTAP\u2019s Zacks Rank & Share Price Performance\n\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 19.5% in the past six months, underperforming the Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry\u2019s decline of 11.1% and the broader Consumer Staples sector\u2019s fall of 7.2%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIs TAP Stock a Value Play?\n\nMolson Coors shares are currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 8.22X, at a discount compared with the industry\u2019s average of 14.52X.

Brands (NYSE:YUM) is a multinational corporation that owns KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and The Habit Burger Grill.\n\nTwo Things to Like:\n\n1. Restaurant Growth Signals an Offensive Strategy\n\nThe number of dining locations a restaurant chain operates is a critical driver of how quickly company-level sales can grow.\n\nYum! Brands sported 62,016 locations in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, it has opened new restaurants at a rapid clip by averaging 4.5% annual growth, among the fastest in the restaurant sector. Additionally, one dynamic making expansion more seamless is the company\u2019s franchise model, where franchisees are primarily responsible for opening new restaurants while Yum! Brands provides support.\n\nWhen a chain opens new restaurants, it usually means it\u2019s investing for growth because there\u2019s healthy demand for its meals and there are markets where its concepts have few or no locations.Yum! Brands Operating Locations\n\n2. Excellent Free Cash Flow Margin Boosts Reinvestment Potential\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\nYum! Brands has shown terrific cash profitability, driven by its lucrative business model that enables it to reinvest, return capital to investors, and stay ahead of the competition. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the restaurant sector, averaging 19.2% over the last two years.Yum! Brands Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin\n\nOne Reason to be Careful:\n\nFlat Same-Store Sales Indicate Weak Demand\n\nSame-store sales is a key performance indicator used to measure organic growth at restaurants open for at least a year.\n\nYum! Brands\u2019s demand within its existing dining locations has barely increased over the last two years as its same-store sales were flat.Yum! Brands Same-Store Sales Growth\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nYum! Brands has huge potential even though it has some open questions. With its shares trailing the market in recent months, the stock trades at 23.1\u00d7 forward P/E (or $148.81 per share).

It\u2019s going to be tough to dethrone Amazon as the leader of a couple of different growth markets. Interest in electric vehicles may be tepid within the United States, but that\u2019s certainly not the case everywhere else. 10 stocks we like better than PepsiCo \u203a\n\nPlenty of companies tout their long-term growth prospects, and many investors believe them.\n\nThe fact is, however, most companies won't quite meet these lofty long-term expectations. It takes something special for a company to thrive for decades on end -- or even in perpetuity -- and reward shareholders for their patience.\n\nThese names are out there though, with some of them hiding in plain sight. Here's a look at three such stocks that could create lasting generational wealth. Or, they could at least dish out enough multiyear gains in the meantime to leave a nice lump sum to your grandchildren.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. PepsiCo\n\nWhen given the choice of beverage stocks to buy, most investors tend to choose Coca-Cola over PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). And understandably so. Not only is Coke the bigger of the two, it's also a more familiar household name.\n\nIf you're going to choose one or the other right now, PepsiCo stock is arguably the better choice here for a couple of reasons.\n\nOne of these reasons is very basic. That is, PepsiCo's dividend is higher, with a forward-looking dividend yield of 3.9% versus Coke's 2.9%. Although there's always more to a dividend stock than its yield (like longevity, or its historical growth), these two stocks' dividend pedigrees are similar enough to still make PepsiCo's bigger yield the smarter overall choice at this time.\n\nCoca-Cola has raised its per-share dividend payment every year for the past 63 years, for instance, but PepsiCo is no slouch with 53 consecutive annual increases of its payout.\n\nAs for the other big reason pick PepsiCo over Coke here, while it's not readily evident from a consumer's point of view, the two beverage companies are operationally quite different.\n\nNot only does PepsiCo own the Frito-Lay family of snack chips as well as Quaker Oats, but PepsiCo owns (or at least controls) most of its bottling and production facilities, whereas Coca-Cola punts the majority of its bottling work to contracted third-party bottlers so it can focus on what it does best. That's marketing. It's been a high-margin business model that's worked well for Coca-Cola for years now, too.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith artificial intelligence (AI) leveling the playing field for beverage companies of all sizes though (at the same time consumers are increasingly willing to try less-established and less-obvious brands), PepsiCo's more complete control of its entire -- and more diversified -- business could prove to be a strategic advantage.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nThere's no denying Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) highest-growth days are in the rearview mirror. After all, when you're already realizing more than $600 billion worth of revenue per year, it's logistically difficult to find more customers, or find more ways to generate more sales from existing customers.\n\nStill, last quarter's top line growth of 13% is pretty impressive for a $2.5 trillion behemoth. And it's this sheer size that makes Amazon such a compelling long-term growth prospect.\n\nWhile it's not outright impossible, dethroning a market leader is pretty difficult to do. An industry's leading name usually becomes its biggest name for good reason, after all, one of which is a fierce focus on the customer experience that Amazon's current CEO Andy Jassy still obsesses over. It's also difficult to displace a market leader when that market leader makes a point of being paranoid about its competition, which Amazon does.\n\nIn other words, Amazon isn't about to be displaced as North America's leading e-commerce outfit, or the planet's leading cloud computing service provider.\n\nNeither business is apt to run into any real headwinds anytime soon either. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that -- despite e-commerce's growth over the course of the past 25 years -- still less than one-fifth of this country's retail spending is done online. Meanwhile, the AI boom is not only creating demand for more remote (cloud-based) computing solutions, but also driving the need for more storage of all the digital data now being created by artificial intelligence. And, there's no end in sight to this dynamic.\n\n3. BYD Company\n\nFinally, add BYD Company(OTC: BYDDY) to your list of stocks that could create lasting generational wealth.\n\nIf you're not familiar with it, BYD is the company that recently displaced Tesla as the world's biggest manufacturer of electric vehicles, as measured by revenue as well as unit sales. It's just not a household name here in America because BYD doesn't sell cars here. Its primary market is China, although it's making surprising inroads in Europe too.\n\nNo place is out of reach in the long run, however. BYD has taken the unusual-but-savvy step of acquiring six massive transport ships (with a seventh on the way), each capable of carrying a few thousand EVs anywhere accessible by ocean.\n\nIt's difficult not to notice this stock's underperformed since the middle of this year. Blame its competitors, mostly, which are putting pressure on its profit margins in an economic environment that isn't exactly robust, particularly in BYD's core market of China.\n\nThis is also apt to be temporary weakness though, turning this ticker's 35% pullback from its June peak into an opportunity rather than a warning. Electric vehicles are still the future, particularly in China, where EY (you may know as Ernst & Young) expects more than 90% of all vehicle sales to be battery-powered automobiles by 2034, up from around 50% this year. The rest of the world shouldn't be too far behind that pace.\n\nThe kicker: BYD is working on solid state lithium batteries that should get electric vehicles over the adoption hump, so to speak. While commercial production is still at least a couple years down the road, this new kind of EV battery charges faster, lasts longer, is safer, and perhaps most importantly, adds meaningfully more driving range to current lithium-based EV batteries.\n\nPlenty of other automobile manufacturers are working on electric vehicles. All of them are going to struggle to catch up with BYD. It's just too far along, and is likely to end up becoming the dominant name in the business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

This strategy focuses on reducing volatility in demand, strengthening pricing power and deepening global reach.\r\n\r\nKO\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d strategy is a multifaceted approach aimed at sustaining steady beverage consumption in a year, reducing its reliance on seasonal demand patterns. The strategy also covers how KO manages its supply chain, using several sources for key ingredients, and how it operates day-to-day, using tools like trade discounts to steady demand and keep distributors involved.\r\n\r\nBy balancing its portfolio across geographies and segments, the company positions itself to perform consistently and deliver growth even in the shifting market conditions. Its highly diversified portfolio, including low-sugar options, sparkling waters, premium beverages, and functional drinks, significantly expands its presence beyond the traditional soda category.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola has shifted to a lighter, more efficient operating setup by refranchising its bottling operations, driving efficiency gains and strengthening free cash flow. This provides greater capacity to invest in marketing, product innovation and sustainability initiatives without compromising shareholder returns. In fact, KO\u2019s global franchise system remains a key competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the company is executing its \u201call-weather\u201d strategy to navigate the complex operating backdrop. At its core, Coca-Cola\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d strategy helps it offset the impact of unseasonal weather and rising inflation, volatile trade conditions and an evolving geopolitical backdrop. As a result, this positions the company to deliver sustained growth and stronger earnings ahead.\n\nKO\u2019s Competition: PEP & MNST in Focus\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. PEP and Monster Beverage Corporation MNST are the beverage companies competing with Coca-Cola.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo continues to emphasize value leadership by offering a sturdy balance of affordability, innovation and brand equity across its beverage and snacks portfolio. PEP leverages broad distribution strength across traditional retail, convenience, e-commerce and foodservice to deliver strong value visibility at multiple price points. PepsiCo\u2019s focus on productivity and digital transformation remains a cornerstone of its long-term strategy to enhance efficiency, fund innovation and support margin expansion.\r\n\r\nMonster Beverage leads the market by delivering strong consumer value and maintaining share in key price segments. Monster Beverage continues to uphold its value leadership in the global energy drinks category, supported by sustained brand equity, strategic innovation and disciplined pricing. The company\u2019s balanced approach to product mix and promotional investments has helped it defend market share and deliver consistent growth, even amid competitive and inflationary pressures. MNST continues to review opportunities for higher prices, domestically and internationally.\n\nStory Continues\n\nKO\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nShares of Coca-Cola have gained 13.8% year to date compared with the\u00a0industry\u2019s growth of 6.5%.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, KO trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.15X compared with the industry\u2019s average of 17.87X.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for KO\u2019s 2025 and 2026 earnings per share (EPS) implies year-over-year growth of 3.5% and 8%, respectively.

In 2025, U.S. beer consumption softened more sharply than historical trends, pressured by macro factors such as inflation, tariffs and strain on lower-income consumers \u2014\u00a0 segments that disproportionately drive mainstream beer purchases. Against this backdrop, Molson Coors\u2019 core brands, including Coors Light and Miller Lite, have faced heightened competitive pressure and shifting consumer behavior, with fewer buyers and reduced spending per trip.\r\n\r\nTo counter these headwinds, Molson Coors is taking a renewed, more aggressive approach to revitalize its core portfolio. The company is increasing marketing investment in flagship brands, launching fresh campaigns and deepening partnerships in high-visibility arenas like sports and music. The strategy also includes sharpening execution in local markets, recognizing that different regions respond differently to pricing, brand messaging and promotional activity. Additionally, TAP is leaning into the momentum of Coors Banquet, a standout performer with strong brand resonance, while working to narrow its distribution gap with Coors Light.\r\n\r\nMolson Coors is rebalancing its portfolio with a stronger focus on economy brands that remain critical in a strained consumer environment. By improving discipline around pricing, innovation and regional activation for brands like Miller High Life and Keystone Light, the company aims to shore up share in the segments where much of the recent softness has originated.\r\n\r\nOverall, while the beer slowdown presents real challenges, Molson Coors\u2019 combination of targeted investment, commercial realignment and renewed attention to its core and economy offerings sets the stage for stabilization, and potentially a return to growth, once macro pressures ease.\n\nTAP\u2019s Zacks Rank & Share Price Performance\n\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 19.5% in the past six months, underperforming the Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry\u2019s decline of 11.1% and the broader Consumer Staples sector\u2019s fall of 7.2%.\n\nTAP Stock's Six-Month PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIs TAP Stock a Value Play?\n\nMolson Coors shares are currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 8.22X, at a discount compared with the industry\u2019s average of 14.52X.

This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Tyler Crowe, and today I'm joined by longtime Fool contributors Lou Whiteman and Rachel Warren. Now, it's November 5th, but I think it's Groundhog Day for me because I think today's show is going to sound a lot like the last time that I spoke with both of you on this Wednesday show. We're going to talk about whether M&A activity in consumer goods is a sign of strength or desperation. But first, we're going to get into the bubble talk again because that's what seems to be on everybody's mind. Last week, at a Federal Reserve policy meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell was asked about the frothiness of the AI market and trying to give him a chance to talk about the comparisons to the dot-com bubble. He said this, and I'm going to quote it specifically. He says, \"This is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued, actually have earnings and stuff like that\". Now, I'm not going to get into Powell's future as a CNBC talking head after that quote, but it does sort of echo a lot of statements we've heard from prominent tech folks, Jeff Bezos and Sam Altman, have more or less said, Yeah, but it's worth it. We've seen some abrupt market reactions during earnings this past week, like Meta's 17% slide since earnings after mentioning ambitious capital plans. I'm going to pose the question to both of you and Lou. I'm going to ask you to go first. Has your opinion on AI market frothiness basically since the last time we did this show?\n\nStory Continues\n\nLou Whiteman: I mean, with all respect to the chairman, they do have earnings and stuff, and we love stuff, so it's good they have stuff. Yes, I do think that makes this different than 1999, when a lot of the companies they didn't have stuff. They had swag that they gave out, but not earnings and stuff. But at the end of the day, all of these earnings, all of this cash is being reinvested into AI, so at least it's something to watch. It's great to have earnings, but if you're blowing it all on something that doesn't work out, you still end up in a pretty tough place. The question is, are they blowing it on something that doesn't work out? I don't think anyone knows. AI is a real thing. I think that there is value there, but is there value that can generate, I don't know, a trillion dollars worth of revenue or whatever they're putting into the investment? Is there the value that can eventually recoup all of this investment? I don't think any of us really know how this all plays out for them in terms of how this investment will impact their bottom line. Yes, it's different this time, but that doesn't mean that things can't go wrong.\n\nRachel Warren: This was interesting. Powell very explicitly pushed back on the direct comparison to the dot-com bubble, and he also really emphasized that AI investments are, as he put it, fueling a genuine engine of US growth. This concept of hundreds of billions of dollars, eventually trillions, being poured into data centers, semiconductors, there's real economic activity there. I think that's fair. I think there's some other points to underscore, as well. A lot of the frothiness that we are seeing in the markets it is being led by very profitable, established companies. Think the NVIDIAs, Microsoft, Alphabet. They are generating substantial AI-related revenue. if you go back to the dot-com bubble days, many companies were pre-profit. They had no revenue. They were valued based on these eyeball metrics or website traffic rather than cash flow. That's very different than a lot of the companies we're talking about today that are driving these movements in the market. I do think it's very, very different than the landscape that companies were operating in two plus decades ago. One thing as an example, AI infrastructure, GPUs, data centers are being deployed and utilized immediately, intensively, because there's genuine immediate demand there. This isn't the days of overinvestment in infrastructure, think back to the dot-com bubble, fiber optic cables that went unused for years. It's just a completely different paradigm. I will say valuations are high. I do think there is a speculative element to what we're seeing. But I think the speculation is more about the magnitude and speed of the anticipated returns on these investments, not so much whether or not the business models exist themselves. I think there's a lot of really intriguing businesses at play in the AI space right now.\n\nTyler Crowe: When you were saying they don't have stuff like the 1990s, all I can think of is like an old Simpsons episode where basically certificates of stock were being used as toilet paper in an episode, and that's all I can seem to think of when I think of the nineties dot-com boom. Not to put blue on fold that with stuff, though. It was stuff. It just wasn't what they were hoping. Lou, I'm sorry. I'm going to put you on full blast here because you might have a little bit more experience of investing around that time than perhaps Rachel and I did. Comparing to that time, what do you say to this being a bubble?\n\nLou Whiteman: A couple of things to think of, for one, no matter how you want to write the history of the late '90s, the bottom line was that not all companies were created equal and that some did fine and some didn't the real lesson is whether we're in a bubble, whether or not it can all be justified is that there is almost no way that this works out storybook ending for everyone involved. There's almost no way that everyone just loses their shirt. I do think it's time to differentiate between companies. You mentioned Meta was down big this week, and I think Meta is a special case right now. I don't want to be Chicken Little and say, they're in trouble. But for Meta, the argument for all these guys have been they're funding all of this out of free cash flow. That's no longer a talking point for Meta. They are taking on billions of debt. they have moved past the Hey, they earn a lot of money. They spend a lot of money. It's something that they can handle. Debt is fine if used correctly, but it is just changing the calculus. The other thing that makes them special is that I don't know. We talked about this will all be wise or not wise based on their ability to monetize. I see how Microsoft monetizes this. I see how Alphabet monetizes it. I see how Amazon even monetizes it. Meta talks about how making their ads more efficient and things like that. That's not worth $1 trillion. I think their path to monetization is harder. I think the fact that they seem to be stretching themselves the thinnest, perhaps with some of this off-balance sheet work, and they are the one that it's hardest for me to see how they monetize. The combination there, I get why the market is being a little harder on them than they are for some of the others.\n\nTyler Crowe: I'll give the last question to Rachel here after this, we'll move on. Again, thinking of the idea of separating the hype ideas that we saw during the last dot-com bubble and the ones that frankly are starting to pop up now. Everyone today is mentioning something about driven by AI or utilizing AI. It's almost criminal these days to not have artificial intelligence in some SEC disclosure for a company. You could be hauling trash, and you have to use AI. But thinking about it in that way, how do you separate, like what is just SEC disclosure fluff and real fundamental drivers for businesses with AI?\n\nRachel Warren: You think about these real companies are already generating or have a clear line to generating solid revenue streams tied directly to their AI solutions. It's not just speculation. I think that's where we've talked about this on the show before, in this day and age, and I anticipate this will change, particularly over the next 5-10 years. But if you're investing in the public markets, a lot of the really compelling investment opportunities for AI are in these big tech companies. That's really the funnel as a retail investor to gain a slice of the action, if you will, of what's happening in AI. That will change. I think we'll see some of these newer entrants to the market that become publicly traded as the markets relax a bit. That will also then provide an opportunity to see, OK, are there businesses here that really warrant an investment, as a long-term buy-and-hold investor? Or is there hype there? But looking again, for those traditional financial metrics whether it's cash flow, consistent earnings, or a manageable debt level that's really key. One final thing I'll note is genuine AI innovators, they often build a moat, if you will, by gathering very proprietary, high-quality data that constantly improves their systems. Of course, you think of names like Alphabet and Amazon here. You can also think of healthcare companies, that are wading into the AI revolution, like Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson they're leveraging these vast amounts of proprietary data and training models to accelerate drug discovery and improve clinical trials and other key endpoints there. There's a lot of exciting things happening. I think the investability of it is really just in the very early stages at this point.\n\nTyler Crowe: Well, speaking of companies that probably could use a little AI juice to help them out, we're going to talk about consumer brands coming up after the break. Now, I don't think consumer staples investors will be bouncing their grand kids on their laps, talking about the past few years. The three-year performance for the consumer Staples SPDR ETF has underperformed the S&P 500, 15%-82%. Nobody's talking about that. It's not a great number. Now, I bring this up because there's been a lot of corporate deals picking up in the consumer staples space. Earlier this week, we saw Kimberly Clark acquire Kenvue for $40 billion and change. Kraft Heinz is splitting itself in two. PepsiCo has opened up the checkbook quite a bit lately with several smaller acquisitions, but the total adds up over time. Unilever is IPOing its ice cream business. Private equity is circling Nestle.Mondelez has tried to acquire Hershey. The stories go on. Now, I say this because the list is expensive, and the question I have, and I'll start with you, Rachel, is whether this under performance in corporate and these corporate shakeups that we're seeing in the consumer space, is it just the market cycles that we see in every day or these desperate moves from an industry that's facing a lot of challenges?\n\nRachel Warren: I think the industry is facing a lot of challenges, and I think it's also very much a trend of consolidation that we've seen for a while now. There's a couple key points here. There was a study that came out from Boston Consulting Group that found that global M&A activity increased by about 10% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period last year. Now, in the second quarter of this year, according to a separate KPMG report, the consumer sub sector saw roughly 175-year-over-year increase in deal value. Bear in mind, we are very much not even close to a time where M&A activity is heating up like it was in the 2021 era. We are seeing more activity in certain sectors, the consumer space being one of them. I think some of these deals could be taken on their own merits. You know, Kimberly Clark, for example, that pending acquisition of Kenvue, that's going to create a combined entity that they think is going to bring in about 32 billion in annual revenue. Kimberly Clark, they've lagged behind rivals like Procter & Gamble. They're hoping this will help them become a leading consumer company, particularly in the higher-margin consumer healthcare space. Bear in mind, Johnson & Johnson spun off its consumer business into Kenvue just a few years ago, and this was one of the oldest and slowest-growing segments. I think that's a perfect example of a company that really makes sense as part of a larger consumer goods or multinational conglomerate, rather than as a stand-alone. But there's a lot of consolidation happening in the space right now. You think back to Mars, they're nearly $40 billion acquisition of Kellogg, which was the snacking spinoff from Kellogg. Ferraro's $3.1 billion acquisition of WK Kellogg. A lot of this is consolidation. A couple more examples. Foot Locker, they got acquired by DICK'S Sporting Goods. Sketchers was acquired by 3G Capital. I think we're going to continue to see these movements in the space. I don't think this is a one-off, and I would expect that a lot of consolidation could still lie ahead.\n\nTyler Crowe: There's a lot going on and a lot of activity. Like you said, this is really navigating a lot of different angles. After the break, we're going to put the real rubber to the road on a lot of these deals and figure out which ones are actually going to work. We covered a lot of different deals in the previous segment, Lou, and I really want to get to your thoughts on this on how it all comes together and whether some of these deals are going to work. Like you said, some of these assets are being hot potatoed from company to company, and M&A isn't always the best way to grow. Looking across that spectrum that we just talked about, what do you see working out of any of this?\n\nLou Whiteman: It's funny. I love that you started with Kraft Heinz, because Kraft Heinz is what I keep thinking of when I see this Kenvue deal. Kraft Heinz, I think we can say it now, almost universally agreed as a failed merger attempt. That's why they're breaking up. It just hasn't worked out. Again, I look at the Kimberly Clark deal, and I worry about the outcome. Here is sort of, for me, the big overall theory of what's going on. The middle in retail has just been totally hollowed out. Consumers are still willing to pay for red hot brands, celebrity endorsements, something with Bieber on it, whatever it is. We love to pay up for that. We will still pay a premium for some things, on holding shoes, too. There are some things that we will pay just through the roof for. But we also really like the commodity, just the store brands. that middle ground. That middle ground, which makes up a lot of Kraft Heinz's portfolio, and a lot of Kimberly Clark's portfolio, and a lot of Kenvue's portfolio, that is what is suffered. Look, do we really care about Kleenex and Band-Aid anymore? That doesn't resonate to consumers when the Kroger brand or the Walmart brand is a few dollars cheaper? Glass half full here, the only answer is scale. The only way to do this is to do it just with great efficiency. Kimberly Clark, buying Kenvue, all of these deals, consolidate, grab scale. It gives yourself a chance. But if you look at the Kimberly Clark deal, it's glass-half-empty, they're just adding a whole new portfolio of question marks to an already pretty big existing portfolio of question marks. I'm not sure how a whole bunch of question marks really turns into a winning investment, unfortunately.\n\nTyler Crowe: I'm going to put this both to you at the end here, and you can be very quick about it. But of the M&A activity or the deals that we've been talking about in this space, and a lot of the ones that Rachel covered earlier, which of those ones do you think is actually going to work?\n\nRachel Warren: I tend to think Kimberly Clark's acquisition of Kenvue makes sense. I understand why Johnson & Johnson spun that one off. It was dragging on their business. They really wanted to focus on the pharmaceutical side. I think it makes a lot more sense as part of a bigger organization like Kimberly Clark. Certainly one to watch, though. But I think it makes sense as part of the overall organization.\n\nLou Whiteman: One she mentioned that I think is different from all of these, I do like DICK'S deal for Foot Locker. I think that makes sense for different reasons from what we're talking about. That's the one I would pick.\n\nTyler Crowe: As the host, I get to punt and not give an answer. I don't know if I'm terribly excited for any of them. With that, that's going to be the end of our show. Tune in tomorrow, where I'll be hosting along with Matt Frankel and John Quass, we'll be going over software earnings, stocks on radar, and a bunch of other stuff.

However, the consumer staples sector has failed to participate in this year\u2019s rally. Year to date, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) is the only sector out of 11 broad-sectors of the S&P 500 Index that is trading in the red with a loss of 1.7%.\n\nThe consumer staples sector faces headwinds from rising living costs, which strain household budgets and lead to more cautious consumer spending. As a result, the sector is experiencing margin compression.\n\nDespite this poor show, a handful of consumer staples stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank have the potential to perform well in 2026 and stabilize one\u2019s portfolio returns. Five such stocks are: PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Monster Beverage Corp. MNST, Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. LW, United Natural Foods Inc. UNFI and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc. OLLI. Each of our picks currently carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

PEP remains focused on localizing flavor, expanding price-pack options for value-conscious consumers, and scaling global partnerships like its Formula 1 deal.\n\nPEP\u2019s focus on productivity and digital transformation remains a cornerstone of its long-term strategy to enhance efficiency, fund innovation, and support margin expansion. PEP continues to advance its multi-year, enterprise-wide productivity initiatives, which are fueled by automation, standardization, and increased adoption of digital tools and data analytics.\n\nPepsiCo has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.3% and 5.6%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year\u2019s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nMonster Beverage Corp.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Monster Beverage has been benefiting from the expansion of the energy drinks market and product launches, reinforcing its category strength. MNST continues to benefit from constant growth in the global energy drink market, backed by strong demand across convenience stores and other key retail channels.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn third-quarter 2025, the Monster Energy Drinks segment's sales grew 16% on a currency-adjusted basis. Improving margins, supported by easing supply-chain pressures and lower costs, have contributed to MNST\u2019s financial stability.\n\nMonster Beverage has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.3% and 12.8%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year\u2019s earnings has improved 1.8% over the last seven days.\n\nLamb Weston Holdings Inc.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Lamb Weston\u2019s \u201cFocus to Win\u201d strategy is fueling growth by emphasizing strong execution, customer engagement and innovation. LW is improving operational efficiency while expanding its presence across key channels in North America and international markets.\n\nLW\u2019s restructuring and cost-saving initiatives are progressing as planned. At the same time, ongoing investments in capacity, modernization and sustainability are strengthening LW\u2019s long-term competitiveness.\n\nInnovation continues to drive growth, highlighted by new product launches and expanded global capabilities. LW also delivers consistent value to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect volume to rise 4.1% year over year in fiscal 2026.\n\nLamb Weston Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 1.3% and -6.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending May 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year\u2019s earnings has improved 9.4% over the last 60 days.\n\nUnited Natural Foods Inc.\n\nZacks Rank #1 United Natural Foods has continued to demonstrate strong growth and operational discipline, supported by wholesale momentum and sustained demand for natural and organic products. Strategic initiatives like customer base expansion, network optimization, and lean management practices have driven efficiency gains, cost savings, and improved service quality.\n\nUNFI posted impressive third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, beating revenue and earnings estimates and marking seven straight quarters of adjusted EBITDA growth. With lean-management initiatives expanding across its network and ongoing customer-support efforts, UNFI is committed to long-term value creation. UNFI's natural and organic business continues to exhibit impressive growth, backed by heightened consumer demand for healthier and more sustainable products.\n\nUnited Natural Foods has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.5% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending July 2026).

We expect a 16.2% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 16.3% revenue growth, driven by brand-name merchandise at compelling discounts that resonate with value-seeking consumers.\n\nOLLI remains committed to its long-term expansion strategy, aiming to have more than 1,300 stores.

Buy This ETF and Hold It Forever (Do so and You'll Quickly Be a Part Owner of Chevron and Lockheed Martin, Among Many Others)", "content": "Key Points\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks an index of roughly 100 companies that seem financially healthy and have been increasing their dividend payouts. It has delivered double-digit gains, on average, over the past five and 10 years. It's a great way to be quickly diversified with lots of dividend payers (and growers). 10 stocks we like better than Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF \u203a\n\nDo you want decades of passive income? Of course you do -- who wouldn't want cash just arriving at your doorstep, regularly, with little effort required? If you're young, that income can be used to boost your savings toward a down payment or can be deployed into more shares of stock. If you're in or near retirement, that income can help pay for your living expenses.\n\nA particularly effective way to invest in dividend-paying stocks is via a dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- a fund that trades like a stock and that's invested in many dividend payers.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy dividends?\n\nIf you can't help but yawn at the thought of dividend-paying stocks, check out the table below:\n\nDividend-Paying Status Average Annual Total Return, 1973-2024 Dividend growers and initiators 10.24% Dividend payers 9.20% No change in dividend policy 6.75% Dividend non-payers 4.31% Dividend shrinkers and eliminators (0.89%) Equal-weighted S&P 500 index 7.65%\n\nData source: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds.\n\nSee? Dividend-paying stocks can be powerful components of your long-term stock portfolio.\n\nDividend ETFs\n\nThere are multiple solid income-producing ETFs. I've listed some below for you to check out -- including a simple S&P 500 index fund and an ETF focused on preferred stocks, which tend to feature high dividends and little stock price appreciation. The one that seems most compelling to me is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD), and I'll soon dig into it a bit more. (Each of these funds is well worth considering, though!)\n\nETF Recent Yield 5-Year Avg. Annual Return 10-Year Avg. Annual Return iShares Preferred & Income Securities ETF 6.6% 2.28% 3.51% SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF 4.6% 12.47% 8.92% Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF  3.9% 10.01% 11.48% Fidelity High Dividend ETF  3.1% 17.85% N/A iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF  2% 12.84% 13.05% Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF  1.6% 12.18% 13.24% Vanguard S&P 500 ETF  1.1% 15.79% 14.79%\n\nData source: Morningstar.com, as of Nov. 12, 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nYou'll note a wide range of yields and trailing returns above. Before you rush to grab the fattest returns, note that they're often tied to lower dividend yields. There's generally a trade-off between yield and growth, because faster-growing companies tend to want to invest more of their earnings into furthering their growth instead of rewarding shareholders with dividend payouts -- and more established, slower-growing companies often have so much income that they can pay out a larger portion of their income.\n\nI'm most drawn to one of the funds in the middle -- because it offers a nice mix of both income and growth.\n\nMeet the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF\n\nHere are some reasons I love the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF:\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which holds about 100 stocks with track records of paying dividends for at least 10 years -- and which also seem to be tied to high-quality companies. It has a solid dividend yield, recently 3.71%, and that payout has been growing over time: Its quarterly dividend payout was $0.26 per share in September 2025, up considerably from $0.22 in September 2023 and $0.12 in September 2018. Its trailing growth rates are solid, reaching double digits for the past five and 10 years. That's close to or above the roughly 10% average annual gain for the S&P 500 over many decades (ignoring inflation). The past decade has featured above-average market gains, so don't expect that to continue uninterrupted. The coming decade may well feature somewhat lower average annual gains. The ETF features an extremely low expense ratio (annual fee) of just 0.06%, which means you'll have to pay the princely sum of $0.60 for each $1,000 you have invested in the fund.\n\nAs of mid-November, the ETF held 103 stocks, and these were the top 10, together making up 42% of the ETF's total value:\n\nStock Weight in ETF Amgen 4.82% Merck  4.37% AbbVie 4.30% Cisco Systems 4.28% Coca-Cola 4.20% Bristol-Myers Squibb 3.03% Chevron 4.00% PepsiCo 3.95% ConocoPhillips 3.87% Lockheed Martin  3.82%\n\nData source: Morningstar.com.\n\nDig a little deeper into the fund to see if it seems a good fit for you. And remember that there are plenty of other terrific ETFs out there -- including some impressive growth-oriented ETFs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.
