There appears to be a tug-of-war now between the AI bubble bears and the AI/Hyperscaler bulls who say the foundation for huge technological change is upon us. With the potential for a December rate cut back on the table, that could fuel an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nPre-Market Stock Futures:\n\nThe shortened holiday week is here, and the futures are trading higher this morning. Most traders and investors are returning with a severe case of whiplash after the stock market posted some of the wildest swings we have seen this year last week. Skyrocketing after the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings and then plunging. An attempt on Thursday to follow through fell apart before noon, and stocks ended in the red. Friday offered the promise of a rally after New York Fed President John Williams said more rate cuts were possible. That fizzled by mid-morning, only to reverse again in the afternoon, ending Friday with all the major indices substantially higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last seen on Friday at 46,245, up 1.08%; the S&P 500 closed at 6602, up 0.98%; and the NASDAQ, which took the biggest shots last week, at 22,273, up 0.88%. With attendance on Wall Street likely to slow by Wednesday, look for a break in the recent extreme volatility.\n\nTreasury Bonds:\n\nYields were lower across the curve on Friday as buyers returned to take advantage of earlier-week selling. Needless to say, the comments from the New York Fed President boosted the potential for a December 25 basis-point cut, which would bring the Fed funds rate to 3.50%-3.75%, in turn spurring Friday's positive trading. The 30-year-long bond closed the session at 4.72% while the benchmark 10-year note finished the day at 4.07%.\n\nOil and Gas:\n\nThe oil energy complex once again took it in the chin on Friday as both of the major benchmarks finished the day lower. The impetus behind the selling was again attributed to the potential settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war, in which President Trump told President Zelensky of Ukraine he wanted an answer on his peace proposal by Thanksgiving Day. Brent Crude closed trading Friday at $62.49, down 1.4% while West Texas Intermediate was last seen down 1.69% at $58, the lowest close for the Texas Tea since last May. Natural gas was the only winner Friday, finishing up 2.19% at $4.57. With prospects for a cold winter and rising electricity demand, investors need to look at the top stocks in the sector now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGold:\n\nGold was flat on Friday, closing modestly lower at $4,064. While the bullion churned back and forth all last week, the critical $4,000 support level appears to be holding. As we reported last week, the UBS team sees the potential for Gold to reach $4,900 as early as the first quarter of 2026.\n\nCrypto:\n\nThe crypto market experienced a sharp downturn early on Friday, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) slumping to multi-month lows. This was part of a broader \"flight from risk\" as investors moved away from riskier assets amid concerns over tech stock valuations and U.S. interest rate uncertainty. Friday's stock market reversal helped stem some of the damage, with Bitcoin trading at $83,750 at 4 PM EST and Ethereum at $2,741. Please keep in mind that cryptocurrencies trade 24/7/365.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Its technology is now found in cars, giving drivers the ability to use voice commands, and in restaurants, where it's helping customers' orders be more accurate, among other things.\n\nThe stock pulled back in part because it had run up so much, and bulls still think it has some great years ahead. Management thinks so, too, having recently upped its projections.\n\n2. CoreWeave\n\nCoreWeave(NASDAQ: CRWV), with a recent market value around $37 billion, is another company that is probably unfamiliar to many. You might want to know about it, though, as it's deeply involved in the spread of data centers, which have become critical for the growth of AI.\n\nIts revenue has gone from $16 million in 2022 to $229 million in 2023 to $1.9 billion in 2024 -- and $4.3 billion over the past 12 months. That's monstrous, but it's worth noting the company is posting net losses on that revenue, not net gains, because it's investing so heavily in its growth.\n\nCoreWeave has taken on a lot of debt for that, too. Companies that grow this way can certainly survive and thrive, but it's not guaranteed. This isn't a no-brainer growth stock. However, you might want to learn more about it to see if you think it's worth a modest investment. Its stock price is much more reasonable after a 25% drop over the past three months.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become a market darling -- and for good reason. A leading semiconductor company, it has grown like gangbusters, having switched its main focus from gaming chips to chips used in data centers for AI.\n\nThe company's stock has averaged annual gains of 69% over the past five years and 53% over the past 15 years -- and it still doesn't seem wildly overvalued. Its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28 is well below the five-year average of 38.\n\nIs Nvidia a no-brainer monster stock to buy? Not necessarily. It's always good to use your brain to assess pro and con arguments for any investment. There are sky-high expectations for Nvidia, but some do warn about depreciation issues leading to oversized expectations. Also, it has some competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom.\n\nStill, Nvidia showing little sign of slowing. Its recently reported third quarter featured record revenue, up 22% from three months earlier and up 62% year over year. For just data-center revenue, those numbers are 25% and 66%. I'm hanging on to my own shares, and I'd suggest that anyone who buys this or any stock simply keep up with its progress, to see whether any bear arguments are gaining credence or whether any worrisome signs are emerging.\n\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is a giant semiconductor company, albeit somewhat unique. While most chip companies only design chips, Taiwan Semiconductor actually manufactures them.\n\nIt's the biggest chipmaker by far -- with a recent 68% market share in global semiconductor manufacturing. (With advanced processors, its market share is around 90%.) Its stock has averaged annual gains of nearly 25% over the past 15 years.\n\nA recent Motley Fool research report on just how Taiwan Semiconductor makes its money is revealing, showing that the company is increasingly making chips with smaller and smaller transistors, which are more power-efficient and faster. It's well-positioned to profit from the boom in AI -- and from a bottleneck of orders.\n\nThe company's shares seem reasonably valued at recent levels, too. Its recent forward P/E ratio of 23.6 is a bit above the five-year average of 20.2, but the company is growing rapidly. In its third quarter, revenue was up 30% year over year, while net income grew 39%. Its net profit margin was also impressive, at a hefty 45.7%.\n\nBetter still, Taiwan Semiconductor is a dividend payer, too, with a recent dividend yield of 1%. That may not seem like much, but note that it's been growing fairly rapidly, with the payout nearly doubling over the past five years.\n\nGive these monstrous stocks some consideration, and dig deeper into any that intrigue you.

The November 18 release of Gemini 3 Pro with its new Deep Think reasoning mode has impressed analysts with benchmarks and pricing that outperformed expectations, especially compared to Microsoft\u2019s recent Ignite conference and ChatGPT 5\u2019s August release.\n\nGemini 3 topped benchmarks for coding, tool use, math, science, and multimodal reasoning. The model is immediately available across Google\u2019s ecosystem and third-party platforms like GitHub and Replit, potentially helping Google\u2019s profitable API business.\n\nGoogle\u2019s custom TPU chip, now in its seventh generation, has become a significant advantage. Reitzes notes that Gemini 3 was trained primarily on Google TPUs, giving Alphabet a price advantage. Outside of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, the TPU is considered the most proven AI chip with the most tangible momentum.\n\nThis progress has created concerns for OpenAI, with CEO Sam Altman acknowledging in an internal memo that Google\u2019s advances could create \"temporary economic headwinds.\" This admission, combined with reports of slower user growth, has impacted investor confidence in OpenAI and affected stocks like Oracle, AMD, Microsoft, CoreWeave, Broadcom, and Nvidia.\n\nAMD and Oracle appear most exposed to OpenAI\u2019s success. AMD has fallen 23% from its October high, while Oracle is down 39% from its September peak. AMD\u2019s deal with OpenAI involves adding 6GW of capacity starting in the second half of 2026, while Oracle has included a $300 billion deal with OpenAI in its RPO backlog.\n\nFor investors seeking safer options amid AI volatility, Reitzes suggests Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Apple is described as a \"toll road\" to mobile AI that can benefit regardless of which company ultimately dominates the AI race. The analyst maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a $345 price target.\n\nIBM offers stability through its mainframe cycle and infrastructure software, with promising developments in quantum computing. Cisco is gaining ground selling optics to hyperscalers for AI while benefiting from a campus switching cycle in enterprise.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) faces challenges from Google\u2019s AI image generation and editing tools, which could potentially draw users away from Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud ecosystem despite their partnership to integrate Gemini 3.\n\nRelated articles\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini 3 advances shake up AI competitive landscape\n\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\n\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-gemini-3-advances-shake-140624037.html", "symbols": ["1GOOG.MI", "1GOOGL.MI", "AAPL.US", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEC.F", "ADBE.US", "AMD.US", "CSCO.US", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.BA"], "tags": ["AI", "EARNINGS", "PRICE TARGET", "PRICE-TARGET", "SEMICONDUCTORS", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.022, "neu": 0.832, "pos": 0.147}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T13:58:47+00:00", "title": "OpenAI could need $207B in financing by 2030 amid compute capacity pledges: HSBC", "content": "[Machine Learning.

One unknown parameter is the flexibility that OpenAI may have to adjust its commitment vs effective demand or financial capacity.

The analysts said that OpenAI\u2019s forecast of $1.4T of compute costs over eight years adds to investor nervousness about associated returns (given estimated revenue of $12.5B in 2025), not only for OpenAI but for the interlaced AI chain.\n\n\"Yet as MSFT\u2019s CEO put it, AI model companies, infrastructure owners, and chipmakers going to market together is helping customers to realize AI\u2019s value.

Uncertainty means the Fed's decision is not yet baked into prices. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nWednesday, Dec. 10, could turn out to be a very big day for the stock market and equity investors. That's the day the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting committee -- the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) -- will convene its final meeting of the year and announce whether it will cut its benchmark interest rate one last time in 2025.\n\nAs most investors are aware, the Fed's interest-rate decisions can have huge consequences for the stock market. A cut on Dec. 10 to the federal funds rate would likely push the market higher, while a decision to leave the rate at its current level would be a major disappointment and probably send indexes sharply lower. A hike to the rate is extremely unlikely.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFuture guidance is conflicted\n\nOften, the Fed telegraphs exactly what it will do far in advance of an FOMC meeting, but this time is a bit different. In recent weeks, there has been considerable uncertainty in the market about whether the FOMC will cut its benchmark interest rate again at its final meeting of the year.\n\nAt its last meeting, which took place in late October, the FOMC cut the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point. That should have been a reason for investors to cheer.\n\nHowever, Fed chair Jerome Powell rained on Wall Street's parade by suggesting in his post-meeting press conference that a December cut was no sure thing, even though the market had been expecting another cut at the next meeting. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it,\" he told reporters. That sent stocks and the S&P 500 index lower.\n\nHowever, last Friday, Nov. 21, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, John C. Williams, hinted in a speech that another cut is likely in December. Williams, who heads the most important Federal Reserve bank and so has a bigger megaphone than most Fed officials other than Powell, said the current fed funds rate is \"modestly restrictive\" -- meaning that it's slowing economic activity at a time when the labor market has cooled off.\n\nGrowing confusion in the futures market\n\nAnd so, Williams concluded, there is \"room for a further adjustment in the near term to the target range for the federal funds rate to move the stance of policy closer to the range of neutral.\" That's Fed speak for \"a December cut is probably appropriate.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBetween Powell's press conference remarks in October and Williams' speech last week, the market is now officially confused. A month ago, before Powell spoke, futures traders put the odds of a December rate cut at near-certainty, 98.1%. After he spoke that fell dramatically to 44.4% (as of Nov. 14). Now, after Williams' Friday speech, traders have jacked the chances of a cut back up to 71.4%. Those are major and unusually large shifts just a few weeks before an FOMC meeting, and they signal that the market doesn't really know what to expect.\n\nAnd that uncertainty about what the Fed will do on Dec. 10 creates fertile ground for a major move in markets that day.\n\nInvestors, please fasten your seatbelts: We may experience turbulence ahead.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's the Right One.", "content": "Key Points\n\nNvidia beat estimates in its Q3 report and reported accelerating revenue growth. Jensen Huang dismissed concerns about an AI bubble. Investors may be better off focusing on companies like OpenAI and Anthropic to assess the strength of the AI boom. 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia \u203a\n\nThey say the sequel is never as good as the original, but Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) seems to be proving that wrong. Three years after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which kicked off the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Nvidia is still posting blockbuster results and blowing past Wall Street estimates quarter in, quarter out.\n\nThe AI chip superstar reported revenue of $57 billion in the quarter, up 62% from the quarter a year ago. That actually represented an acceleration from the second quarter, when sales growth had slowed to 56%, and was well ahead of the consensus at $55.1 billion. Notably, that acceleration came without the return of significant revenue from China.\n\nOnce again, growth in data center revenue, the focal point of the AI boom, was even stronger, up 66% to $51.2 billion.\n\nThe news helped to quell fears about an AI bubble at a time when tech stocks have been pulling back, especially those that are most exposed to AI, including highly leveraged neocloud operators like CoreWeave and Nebius.\n\nNvidia, which was down 12% from its recent high before the report, jumped 6% on the news, adding $300 billion in market value to approach a $5 trillion market cap again.Image source: Nvidia.\n\nBubble, what bubble?\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang didn't shy away from addressing talk of an AI bubble. In fact, he began his remarks on the earnings call by addressing those concerns, saying: \"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"\n\nHuang went on to explain the massive investment in non-AI software, and said he sees that shifting away from central processing units (CPUs) to Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), arguing that \"Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point,\" and that AI has as well.\n\nNvidia's guidance indicates that its blistering growth will continue into the fourth quarter as the company is calling for revenue of around $65 billion, well ahead of expectations at $62 billion and representing 65% growth from the quarter a year ago, meaning Nvidia's revenue growth would accelerate again in the fourth quarter to 65%.\n\nInvestors need to zoom out\n\nMaking Nvidia the avatar of the AI revolution makes sense. After all, Nvidia stock has skyrocketed since the launch of ChatGPT. It's now the most valuable company in the world, at nearly $5 billion, because of AI, and because it continues to dominate the market for data center GPUs and AI compute.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, investors following Nvidia for clues into whether or not there's an AI bubble need to look elsewhere as well. Nvidia's contribution to the AI revolution is essential, but the company is building the rails for the AI boom, and that only counts if people want to ride the trains. In tech, that means the hardware Nvidia provides to run AI software.\n\nIn order to determine that, the best place to look is at the AI start-ups leading the way, like OpenAI and Anthropic, and CFO Colette Kress pointed to the surging growth at those companies and others, noting a positive virtuous cycle that is leading to increasing adoption and profits.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic are harder to follow because they're privately held, but their numbers back up those claims and should allay concerns of a bubble.\n\nOpenAI's valuation has hit $500 billion, but it expects to more than triple its revenue this year, hitting $13 billion, or a run rate of $20 billion. Considering software valuations that are sometimes 25 or 30 times sales, or even higher, OpenAI seems reasonably valued given how fast it's growing. CEO Sam Altman even suggested that the company could hit $100 billion by 2027.\n\nAnthropic is in a similar situation, on track to reach run-rate revenue of $9 billion and aiming for $20 billion to $26 billion in run-rate revenue by the end of 2026, making its valuation of $350 billion look fair as well.\n\nAdding in Palantir, which has a market cap of $400 billion, the three most valuable software companies are now squarely AI software companies.\n\nWe're likely to see more of the software value in the tech sector shift to AI, as Huang predicted.\n\nAs long as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are doubling or tripling their revenue, concerns of an AI bubble seem overblown.\n\nAs Nvidia's management explained, a tipping point and a positive virtuous cycle are at hand. Investors shouldn't mistake the problems in the broader economy for cracks in the AI storyline as AI adoption is ramping up rapidly at both the hardware and software levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Both Micron and SK Hynix enjoy pricing power and multiyear revenue visibility for their HBM and advanced DRAM offerings. SK Hynix is already the leader in the HBM market, while Micron is focused on expanding its market share. 10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology \u203a\n\nInvestors who are looking for high-potential artificial intelligence (AI) stocks often pick well-known semiconductor players such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, hyperscalers such as Amazon and Microsoft, or software players like Palantir and SoundHound AI.\n\nBut many investors are missing one real AI opportunity that's staring us in the face.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI models continue to get larger and more complex. Additionally, as the systems mature, hyperscalers and enterprises are transitioning from infrequent AI training workloads to more frequent AI inferencing workloads. And now, memory bandwidth and capacity are proving to be bigger bottlenecks than AI computing capacity in large AI clusters.\n\nWithin that dynamic, leading memory players such as MicronTechnology(NASDAQ: MU) and SK Hynix (OTC: HXSCL) -- already crucial players in the global buildout of AI infrastructure -- are well-positioned to prosper.\n\nFavorable memory market trends\n\nThe server clusters built around cutting-edge AI processing chips increasingly require higher-performance, energy-efficient, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced DRAM in order to operate efficiently. In fact, every new generation of AI GPUs uses increasingly more HBM and advanced DRAM.\n\nSo naturally, data center companies are increasing their spending on memory as part of their ongoing AI infrastructure buildouts. The global HBM market is forecast to grow from $17 billion in 2024 to $98 billion in 2030, while HBM's revenue share in the DRAM market is estimated to grow from 18% to 50% in that same time frame. This trend favors Micron and SK Hynix, which stand to benefit from the higher memory content of systems designed to handle large, scalable AI workloads.\n\nMicron and South Korea-based SK Hynix can expect to enjoy solid pricing power and higher margins, as there is currently a chronic shortage of advanced DRAM. According to DigiTimes, many major hyperscalers are securing only 70% of their server DRAM orders, despite accepting 50% price hikes in the fourth quarter.\n\nMicron is capitalizing on this opportunity\n\nU.S.-based Micron has gradually transformed itself from a cyclical DRAM and NAND producer into a full-stack, AI-optimized memory and storage player. The company's performance in its fiscal 2025 (which ended Aug. 28) was impressive, with revenues soaring 49% to $37.4 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share surging nearly 538% to $8.29. Increasing memory demand from data center operators has been the key growth catalyst. In fiscal 2025, its data center business accounted for 56% of Micron's total revenues.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicron's DRAM market share was close to 22.5% in September. Management also forecast that its HBM market share would be similar to its DRAM share in the third quarter of calendar 2025, as it ramps its third-generation extended (HBM3E) and fourth-generation (HBM4) HBM products. That was an achievable goal, considering that Micron was already the second-largest player in the HBM market in the second quarter of calendar 2025, with a 21% share, according to market research firm Counterpoint Research.\n\nMicron's HBM strategy seems to have been quite successful, as its HBM revenues reached nearly $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which translates to an annual run rate of close to $8 billion. The company has already entered into pricing agreements for a significant chunk of its HBM3E supply in 2026, and expects to sell out its entire 2026 supply in the next few months.\n\nThe company is also advancing its technology leadership and has ramped up production of its 1-gamma DRAM node to achieve mature yields 50% faster than the previous-generation process node. The company was the first to ship a 1-gamma DRAM chip and plans to leverage its superior process technology across its entire DRAM portfolio.\n\nSK Hynix remains the leader\n\nWhile Micron is slowly expanding its market share, SK Hynix is already the leader in the HBM market, with a 62% share as of the second quarter of 2025. SK Hynix has also completed development of its next-generation HBM4 and plans to begin shipping that product in the fourth quarter, followed by a rapid scale-up of production in 2026.\n\nSK Hynix has also finalized its 2026 HBM supply plan for major clients, and management expects HBM supply to remain tight even in 2027. As memory companies increasingly allocate production capacity to HBM, the marketplace is now experiencing shortages of some traditional memory products, too. SK Hynix is also a leader in the DRAM market, with a 35% share in the third quarter. Hence, some of its customers have started issuing pre-purchase orders for DRAM and NAND products for 2026.\n\nThe company also delivered exceptional performance in the third quarter, as revenues soared 39% year over year to 24.4 trillion Korean won (about $16.6 billion). Operating profit also rose 62% to an all-time high of 11.4 trillion Korean won (about $7.7 billion).\n\nAI winners\n\nSK Hynix expects the AI memory market to grow by almost 30% annually through 2030. The company is also a key HBM supplier to Nvidia; Micron supplies the GPU leader with smaller HBM volumes.\n\nWith a favorable demand environment for their offerings and strong technological advantages, both Micron and SK Hynix are well positioned to keep capturing a significant share of this growing and profitable market.\n\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

I'm joined by Russ Mold, investment director at AJ Bell. Russ, thanks so much for joining us.\n\n00:07 Speaker A\n\nWell, let's start with the Fed. Uh, you know, the probability of a Fed rate cut has now risen. I mean, last week I was talking about 30%, 33%, and now it's at 75% according to the Fed Watch tool. Um, what do you make of what we heard from the New York president, a Bank of New York president there? And also whether you do believe the markets are now right to believe that we will get a Fed rate cut next month?\n\n00:27 Russ Mould\n\nYeah, I think Mr. Williams is clearly being very pragmatic. We are starting to catch up on the information that we've been missing for the last couple of months owing to the US government shutdown and although opinions remain split,\n\n00:36 Russ Mould\n\nit is does seem as if there is some slow down in the US jobs market. There is some cooling there. You can see that in vacancies, weekly claims, and you can see that also in the non-farm payrolls data. We'll get a lot more of that on Friday, but there's probably just enough justification in there for the Fed to at least consider cutting and it's not just cutting this month, but if you look at the see me Fed watch service that you quoted, that's pricing in at the moment or factoring in some like 3% rates by next Christmas. So that's a full percentage point below where we are now.\n\n01:03 Speaker A\n\nNow, one of the thick key themes last week and has been for a while now is worries about an AI bubble. Um, we saw a bounce back on Friday, but do you think those fears of a AI bubble are they're still around, aren't they?\n\n01:14 Russ Mould\n\nvery, very much so. and there are more questions being raised about funding for this phenomenal amount of capital expenditure planned by the hyper scale company, companies, 420 billion this year, 500 billion, then 600 billion dollars in 2027. Will there be a return on that investment given that I'm sure Chinese competition isn't going to sleep on that even if there is substantial adoption. and then where do we sit with valuations? Again when Nvidia's market capitalization reached $5 trillion, same as the GDP of Germany. You know, that's for that does say an awful lot of value that's being provided by the 36,000 Nvidia employees compared to 84 million Germans and Nvidia's results were impressive, but there were some holes that you could pick in them in terms of the cash flow, inventories and receivables, and that came back to the funding issue. So that's probably going to be the biggest area of focus in the next one or two Nvidia quarterly numbers.\n\n01:54 Speaker A\n\nNow, uh, so we've talked about the Fed, we've talked about the bubble. The next thing I really want to talk about is Black Friday because we heard from a lot of retailers last week, kind of a mixed bag. Walmart was clearly the standout there, but what are your hopes for Black Friday?\n\n02:05 Russ Mould\n\nYeah, I mean Home Depot popped out a stinker at the same time. so it's again, we're still seeing a very, very bifurcated consumer. even if you look at the the official statistics, University of Michigan surveys down at levels below that we've seen in the last five or six US recessions.\n\n02:16 Russ Mould\n\nThe conference board survey isn't that bleak, but it's well off the peak of last November when the president was elected and way below the peak seen during his first term in office. So there are signs that some American consumers are feeling the strain. You're seeing that in some of the subprime areas particularly. But again, it's a very K-shaped economy you could argue. those at the top are doing really well, they've got assets. Those further down the pipe are feeling a lot of pressure from inflation.\n\n02:37 Russ Mould\n\nAnd we saw that politically in the November election results as well. So, I think you will see a very, very mixed set of results from retailers. But at least one thing you might argue is that Black Friday is normally pretty good for a discount. So then it's up to the retailers to manage that appropriately and preserve margins as well as generate cash flow.\n\n02:49 Speaker A\n\nI'm not going to get into your shopping list now, but let's look at earnings as well. We've got John Deere, their results out on Wednesday. Um, it's fair to say sentiment amongst farmers isn't that great right now. Am I right?\n\n03:03 Russ Mould\n\nNo, it is and I think the the presidency has been responding to that with some of the trade deals we've seen with with with other countries. Um, but equally, you know, Deer's numbers have been reflecting that. The last set of numbers back in August weren't very strong. Analysts are predicting a double digit percentage earnings per share decline for this quarter and for the year as a whole. I think there will be much more what's the company seeing going forward in terms of backlog and also in terms of tariff impact, they'll be shaping the numbers for the coming year when analysts do expect a 7-8% improvement in earnings per share across the year as a whole.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/crucial-black-friday-ai-bubble-130316114.html", "symbols": ["1NVDA.MI", "AJB.LSE", "HD.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F", "WALM34.SA", "WMT.BA", "WMT.F", "WMT.MX", "WMT.US"], "tags": ["AI-BUBBLE", "EARNINGS", "EARNINGS PER SHARE", "EARNINGS RESULTS", "FED", "INFLATION", "RETAIL", "SPLIT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.045, "neu": 0.86, "pos": 0.095}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T12:54:27+00:00", "title": "Nvidia chip sales to China among key decisions for Trump, says Lutnick", "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that President Donald Trump will personally decide whether to allow Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to China, as trade negotiations between the United States and European Union continue in Brussels.\n\nSpeaking from Europe, Lutnick described the Nvidia decision as sitting \"right on the desk of Donald Trump,\" with the president weighing input from various advisers including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has advocated for the sales.\n\n\"He\u2019s going to decide whether we go forward with that or not and we will execute it however he decides to go forward,\" Lutnick said, framing the decision as a choice between allowing China to use American technology or competing separately in the AI race.\n\nThe Commerce Secretary expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would uphold the administration\u2019s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for imposing tariffs, after attending oral arguments. \"I left that day feeling very confident that we and the president was going to prevail on these IEEPA tariffs,\" he said.\n\nLutnick emphasized that even if the court ruled against the administration, the president has \"lots of other authorities\" including Sections 232, 301, and 338 to implement tariffs.\n\nRegarding ongoing EU-US trade talks, Lutnick indicated that \"everything is on the table\" in discussions with the EU, which he called \"a great partner\" with 450 million people and a $20 trillion economy.\n\nThe negotiations involve potential concessions where the EU would reconsider its digital regulations to accommodate American technology companies, while the U.S. would offer concessions on steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\n\"We think it is very important that they understand our digital companies,\" Lutnick said, noting that the EU is not receiving the same level of investment as the United States, where tech companies are investing trillions in data centers.\n\nLutnick suggested that if European regulators \"take their foot off the regulatory statement,\" American companies could build data centers in Europe, potentially bringing \"hundreds of billions, possibly $1 trillion of investment\" from U.S. tech companies.\n\nThe Commerce Secretary also emphasized the Trump administration\u2019s focus on affordability, stating they are \"going through every line\" to ensure affordability across the consumer landscape while also working to raise incomes.\n\nRelated articles\n\nNvidia chip sales to China among key decisions for Trump, says Lutnick\n\nStory Continues\n\nThese Under-$10 Stocks Are Up 100%+ This Quarter - And Some Still Have Room to Run\n\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-chip-sales-china-among-125427798.html", "symbols": ["1NVDA.MI", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F"], "tags": ["AI", "DIGITAL-REGULATIONS", "TARIFFS", "TECH", "TRADE-NEGOTIATIONS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.964, "neg": 0.023, "neu": 0.907, "pos": 0.07}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T12:45:08+00:00", "title": "Why Alphabet Rules The Magnificent 7 As AI Trade Falters.

It is entirely reasonable for [days sales outstanding] to rise as receivables become more concentrated in a handful of large customers. This reflects the bargaining power of key accounts\u2014especially cloud service providers (CSPs), which have historically operated with longer payment terms.\u201d\n\nKuo continued: \u201cAnother flaw in the critics\u2019 analysis is the peer group the view chose. It compared Nvidia\u2019s DSO to companies whose primary customers are not CSPs. A more appropriate comparison set is suppliers whose main customers are the same CSPs\u2014such as Arista, Celestica, and Vertiv\u2014whose [days sales outstanding] typically run above 60\u201370 days. Against that backdrop, Nvidia\u2019s 53-day DSO looks entirely reasonable, not anomalous.\u201d\n\nThe other concern is Nvidia's inventory levels, which rose 32% sequentially, despite Huang saying cloud GPUs are \u201csold out.\u201d [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4523835-nvidia-pops-as-ai-strength-buoys-q3-results-guidance-huang-says-cloud-gpus-sold-out]\n\nFor that, Kuo said the comparison to H100, when bears claimed inventories declined, is factually inaccurate for two reasons.\n\n\u201cFirst, Q2 FY23 inventory did not decline; it increased by roughly 23% [quarter-over-quarter] to $3.889B, Kuo explained. \u201cSecond, the 32% increase in Q3 FY26 inventory is broadly in line with the ramp in upstream capacity: [Taiwan Semiconductor's] (TSM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM]) [chip-on-a-wafer-substrate] average monthly output is estimated to have grown by roughly 25\u201330% QoQ to around 60kwpm in 3Q25. Within Nvidia\u2019s Q3 FY26 inventory, the largest item was Work-in-Process, which represented 44.2% of total inventory and surged about 98% QoQ to $8.735B. This is best understood as reflecting the ramp and mass production of the new Blackwell B300 GPU starting in 3Q25. Far from being evidence of fraud, it shows that Nvidia had already been preparing for strong demand for the B300.\u201d\n\nMORE ON NVIDIA\n\n \t* Nvidia: I'm Not Sweating A Drop After This Q3 Meltdown [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846971-nvidia-stock-not-sweating-drop-after-this-q3-meltdown]\n \t* The Market Is Mispricing Nvidia's AI Bull Case Again (Rating Upgrade) [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846932-the-market-is-mispricing-nvidias-ai-bull-case-again-upgrade]\n \t* Nvidia: Everyone Knows There's A Bubble [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846606-nvidia-everyone-knows-theres-a-bubble]\n \t* Memory supply remains tight for HPC, AI computing: Wedbush [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525013-memory-supply-remains-tight-for-hpc-ai-computing-wedbush]\n \t* Nvidia, AMD, other chip stocks still have room to run, Raymond James says [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524882-nvidia-amd-other-chip-stocks-still-have-room-to-run-raymond-james-says]\n\n ", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525278-nvidias-increase-in-days-sales-outstanding-is-entirely-reasonable-analyst-says?utm_source=feed_news_all&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;feed_item_type=news", "symbols": ["AMD.US", "NVDA.US", "TSM.US"], "tags": ["AI", "EARNINGS", "GUIDANCE", "INVENTORY", "QUARTERLY RESULTS", "SEMICONDUCTORS", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.967, "neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.914, "pos": 0.067}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T12:30:00+00:00", "title": "This Is the Best AI Stock to Buy as Spending Shifts Toward Hardware", "content": "Key Points\n\nNvidia's data center sales have surged more than 3,700% over the past five years. Data center infrastructure spending could reach an estimated $4 trillion by 2030. Nvidia probably won't deliver the same returns it has over the past few years, but owning the stock for the long term is still a wise decision. 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia \u203a\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) companies are benefiting from a surge in demand and new investments as companies worldwide shift their strategies toward AI-focused products and services. However, while many companies have seen their share prices rise thanks to AI, not all will benefit as the industry's focus shifts toward hardware.\n\nIn the tech world, being an advanced hardware company is much more challenging than creating a new AI service. It takes years of investment, strategy, and customer adoption to lead in the hardware industry. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been extremely successful at this, and it's likely to continue being one of the best AI stocks as the broader hardware story plays out. Here's why.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI hardware spending is still accelerating\n\nNvidia designs some of the world's most advanced processors used in AI data centers. Even years before AI took off, big tech companies used Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to train their AI systems. Then, when OpenAI released ChatGPT and the AI arms race started, they ramped up spending, and other companies joined the race.\n\nThe result has been staggering for Nvidia's data center sales. Consider that in fiscal 2020, the company had about $3 billion in data center sales. At the end of fiscal 2025, it had surged 3,733% to $115 billion.\n\nThose sales are a direct result of OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and others investing billions of dollars to build new AI data centers and expand existing ones.\n\nAnd they're not done yet.\n\nAlphabet said recently that it would spend an additional $40 billion for data centers over the next two years; AI company Anthropic recently announced it would spend an additional $50 billion to build new AI infrastructure; and OpenAI has said that it's spending more than $1 trillion over the next eight years. What's more, Nvidia's Jensen Huang said in a recent quarterly earnings call that he estimates tech giants will spend between $3 trillion to $4 trillion on AI infrastructure over the next five years.\n\nIn Nvidia's recently reported third-quarter results, the company's data center revenue of $51.2 billion was up 66% from the year-ago quarter and easily beat Wall Street's consensus estimate of $49 billion. With its lead in the data center processor market and tech giants still making big investments, Nvidia continues to prove that it's well positioned to benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNvidia could benefit even when spending slows\n\nWhile there's no current end in sight for AI hardware spending, it's wise to remember that nothing lasts forever. At some point, large tech companies won't need to invest so much in AI infrastructure, and they'll eventually scale back.\n\nIt's likely that when that day comes, some Nvidia investors will panic and hit the sell button. However, I believe there's long-term value in owning the AI hardware even when some of the spending slows, because ongoing updates to data center infrastructure will be necessary, and leading companies will not want to fall behind.\n\nThink of it like buying the most advanced iPhone 10 years ago. Its hardware, camera, and software were very impressive then. But while it's still functional, there's a lot better tech available now. The same is true for AI processors; they're continually getting more advanced, and tech companies will likely need to make ongoing investments in them even after the initial AI surge has passed.\n\nWith Nvidia's processors already holding about 90% of the GPUs in AI data centers, Nvidia will likely benefit from this dominant position for years to come.\n\nAmong AI stocks, Nvidia is priced relatively well\n\nEven with its gains of 1,200% over the past five years, Nvidia's stock has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 46 right now.

IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave are unprofitable, and their expenses are rising. Buying these stocks now means you're paying a premium for an unproven market. 10 stocks we like better than IonQ \u203a\n\nQuantum computing has quickly become one of the most popular technologies to invest in after artificial intelligence. Just take a look at the share price gains of some of the biggest names in the industry -- IonQ(NYSE: IONQ), Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), and D-Wave (NYSE: QBTS), which are up 89%, 1,500%, and 1,800% over the past year, respectively.\n\nThere's good reason for some of the optimism. Quantum computing will eventually aid scientists in discovering new drugs, enhancing climate science, developing new materials, and refining artificial intelligence models. Estimates from BCG suggest that the potential economic value of quantum computing could reach $850 billion by 2040.\n\nHowever, there's also a good reason to be a bit skeptical. With massive run-ups like these quantum computing stocks are experiencing -- though IonQ's is negligible in comparison -- it's a good time to remember that quantum computing is still in its very early stages. Here are two hurdles the industry needs to overcome before people start investing in quantum computing stocks.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Quantum computers still get things wrong -- a lot\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles with quantum computers is that their processing is so complex that they have high error rates. Progress is being made on this front, and most quantum computing companies say that their systems are helping to reduce error rates.\n\nNonetheless, for the technology to be truly transformative, error rates will need to be significantly lower than they are now. To help achieve this, some tech leaders, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, believe that combining traditional supercomputers with quantum computers is the way forward.\n\nThe idea is that traditional supercomputers will handle the computing tasks in which they excel, which helps reduce errors. At the same time, quantum computers take on larger modeling tasks that even supercomputers can't handle. IonQ and Rigetti are already collaborating with Nvidia on the hybrid concept.\n\nStill, it could be years before error rates are low enough to get some of the biggest benefits from quantum computers. Even Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), which released a new quantum computing processor called Willow last year, has hinted that these systems aren't really ready for prime time yet. CEO Sundar Pichai said earlier this year:\"Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications.\"\n\nLeer m\u00e1s\n\nIn other words, quantum computing is getting there, but it's not quite there yet.\n\n2. Revenue is very low, while losses and spending are high\n\nQuantum computing is still a speculative investment by almost any measure. One of the primary reasons this matters to investors is that the high-flying stocks in the industry typically have minimal revenue and are largely unprofitable. Here's a quick look at the revenue, losses, and operating expenses for IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave in the most recent quarter.\n\nCompany Q3 Revenue Q3 Operating Expenses Q3 Net Loss IonQ $39.9 million $208 million ($1.1 billion) Rigetti $1.9 million $20.9 million ($201 million) D-Wave $3.7 million $30.4 million ($140 million)\n\nData source: IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave.\n\nAs you can see, all these companies have negligible sales compared to their losses. Their operating expenses are sizable as the companies spend money to run their business and invest in technology. While being unprofitable isn't unusual for growth companies, I believe it's particularly concerning for shareholders of these quantum computing stocks.\n\nConsider that as their share prices have skyrocketed, their valuations have surged to dizzying levels. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for IonQ is 148, Rigetti's is 964,, and D-Wave's is 282. That's compared to the tech industry's average P/S ratio of about 9.\n\nThat's a recipe for a potentially massive pullback from these stocks if the companies fail to generate meaningful sales and reach profitability. The market is already starting to become impatient with a potential AI bubble, but at least many artificial intelligence companies have profits to support their share price gains.\n\nI don't think quantum computing will be a bust in the long term, but investors certainly seem to be overly optimistic about IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave. These companies still have a long way to go before they become profitable, and there's no guarantee they'll ever reach that goal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

Taiwan Semiconductor is growing rapidly thanks to the AI race. 10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing \u203a\n\nAt the time of this writing, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's second-largest company by market cap, with a $4 trillion valuation. So, predicting that a much smaller company like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) can grow to become larger than Apple is a bold claim, especially when you consider that Taiwan Semi is a $1.4 trillion company right now. However, after looking at growth rates for the industries in which it's involved, I think Taiwan Semiconductor can achieve this feat, making it an incredible stock pick over the next few years.\n\nI think Taiwan Semi could grow to become a larger company than Apple by 2030, but it's going to need a lot of help to accomplish that goal.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is front and center in the AI race\n\nApple doesn't need a lot of introduction. It's a leader in consumer electronics, and there's a good chance that this article is being read from an Apple-powered device. But therein lies the largest issue with Apple: market saturation. Apple has failed to grow revenue at a meaningful pace over the past few years, and it has only had one reported quarter of double-digit revenue growth since mid-2022 (and it only achieved that mark if you round up).AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nApple has done a great job repurchasing shares and decreasing expenses, which has allowed its diluted earnings per share (EPS) to grow in the low-double-digit range. As a result, we'll use 12% as Apple's long-term EPS growth rate.\n\nFor Taiwan Semiconductor, it's at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Its chips are being used in nearly every high-powered AI computing device, ranging from Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to custom AI accelerators from Broadcom. Furthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor is launching new chip technology that promises to improve energy consumption by 25% to 30% when configured for the same speed as previous generations. That's game-changing technology, and allows TSMC to charge a premium for those chips.\n\nFurthermore, there are no signs of the AI race slowing down. The other day, AMD released its projection that it expects its data center division to grow revenue at a 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030. That aligns well with a previous projection given by Nvidia, where global data center capital expenditures are expected to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by 2030. That indicates a 42% CAGR at the midpoint, showcasing that TSMC's chip business can easily grow at that rate as well.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring Q3, Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue rose 41% in U.S. dollars, aligning with the broader market growth. That aligned with TSMC's net income growth as well, so I'll use a 40% EPS growth rate for this projection.\n\nWhile that may seem like an aggressive assumption, it's what's required for TSMC to surpass Apple in market share by 2030. If the AI data center market is as large as the AMD and Nvidia projections, then this assumption may not be unreasonable.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has huge upside if this projection pans out\n\nIf Apple can grow its EPS by 12% throughout 2030 and Taiwan Semiconductor's rises by 40%, that would result in Apple having $13.52 in diluted EPS by the end of 2030 and Taiwan Semiconductor having a jaw-dropping $57.08. That's a substantial increase from today's values.AAPL EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nTo find out how much that would be worth for each company, we need to multiply the EPS figure by the total number of shares outstanding. Then, we'll have to assign it an earnings multiple. Using today's valuation figures (Apple at 36 times earnings and Taiwan Semiconductor at 28), that would give Apple a market cap of $7.2 trillion and Taiwan Semiconductor a market cap of $8.3 trillion by 2030.\n\nWill that happen? I'm not sure. Those are massive growth assumptions baked into Taiwan Semiconductor's stock that may not pan out. But if they do, I think it has a strong chance of surpassing Apple in market cap by 2030.\n\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

He is 65, which is a traditional retirement age.\n\nQuick Read\n\nCook May Be Remembered Well Jobs Will Be Remembered Better  If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nCook was not a logical choice. He had run logistics. His job was worldwide operations, ensuring the trains ran on time. They did, for the most part. There was a problem getting hardware out of China on time. There was a matching supply with demand. There was a need to get the best price for manufacturing. There was sourcing the best camera parts. the best chips, and light and strongest cases\n\nHe never took Job\u2019s job. Jobs was a creative genius. He invented the Mac and iPhone. He built the early operating systems. He ran the software operations and design. He was considered the greatest CEO of the 20th and early 21st Centuries.\n\nWhat Cook did was build more and more generations of iPhones. Each was better than the one before, so people kept coming. Eventually, Apple had 2.1 trillion devices worldwide, making it the most extensive \u201cwalled garden\u201d on earth. And, he made sure there were reasons to stay inside the walled garden with Apple software products.\n\nApple\u2019s stock rose 132% over the last five years. The S&P 500 was up about 88% over the same period. After keeping the top market cap spot off and on, it is at $4 trillion today, just behind Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) $4.3 trillion.\n\nAlthough Cook could not increase sales for Macs and iPads. They were stagnant. New products like Watch were a failure financially. However, he did build a massive business which Apple calls Services, It is now almost 30% of Apple\u2019s revenue. Its is almost everything Apple sells beyond its hardware\n\nIf, over time, Cook is blamed for problems, they will fall into two categories. The first is that he could not hold on to the top market share spot in China. Local companies overwhelmed its share. And, as of now, Apple does not have an AI product, which leaves it a year behind the industry.\n\nOn balance, Cook\u2019s tenure will be considered successful\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Coatue sold 62% of its position in the AI data center company CoreWeave, 15% of its position in the electric vehicle and robotaxi company Tesla, and 14% of its position in the AI chip giant Nvidia.\n\nIn recent months, investors have become increasingly concerned about AI valuations, which have long been high, as well as the macroeconomic environment, with investors penciling in a smaller chance of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December. Furthermore, other AI concerns have emerged, including the large amounts of money the hyperscalers are spending to build out AI infrastructure, which is expected to be in the trillions over the next five years.\n\nOther well-known investors like Michael Burry have been more outspoken on social media regarding concerns over how large AI companies like Oracle and Meta Platforms are accounting for depreciation of semiconductors and servers, specifically as they extend the useful life of them, despite uncertainty about how long they will really last.\n\nOther broader concerns that are coming into the spotlight are whether the U.S. can generate enough electricity to meet the demand for AI. Manufacturing AI chips also requires significant water usage, another issue related to the amount of resources needed to power AI.\n\nStory Continues\n\nUltimately, it's difficult to predict what will happen next in terms of whether this marks the beginning of a pullback or a buy-the-dip opportunity. I don't think AI is about to become irrelevant, but the sector's path is unclear. Investors should be long-term-focused, and in my view, try to avoid some of the higher valuations out there, such as Tesla's.\n\nRevealing positions in two IPOs\n\nOn its third-quarter 13F filing, Coatue reported positions in both the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company Klarna(NYSE: KLAR) and the collaborative design tech company Figma(NYSE: FIG), both of which were high-profile IPOs this year.\n\nFigma went public with tremendous hype, opening at $33 per share and rising to a high of $143 per share, although it would be short-lived. The company essentially provides a Google Docs-like workflow for designers and coders to collaborate on a range of projects, allowing multiple people to work on designs that can be easily translated into code for website or app implementation. The company also has AI components and is being integrated as a third party into ChatGPT.\n\nCoatue actually got involved in the company prior to the IPO, investing in it in 2024 at a $12.5 billion valuation. While selling the stock immediately following the IPO and the huge jump would have been a no-brainer, IPOs often contain lock-up provisions preventing this practice. At the end of the third quarter, Coatue held over 3.2 million shares.\n\nInvestors should still likely be wary of the stock, which has come down significantly after the initial IPO pop. Even at its current $18 billion market cap, Figma is still unprofitable and trades at over 17 times forward revenue.\n\nCoatue also reported owning 330,000 shares of Klarna at the end of the third quarter. I haven't found any evidence that Coatue ever participated in a private financing round of Klarna prior to this report, although it's certainly possible. However, it's also possible that Coatue recently scooped up shares. Klarna's IPO also started hot, but has since fallen below its IPO price.\n\nKlarna trades at a more reasonable valuation than Figma, at about 4 times forward revenue, but its losses have also risen significantly. BNPL companies are heavily impacted by the health of the consumer and the economy, so while the company has potential to disrupt the credit card space, I am still cautious on Klarna at this valuation.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Stocks to open higher on Monday", "content": "The big question after Friday's stock-market rally was how stocks might open on Monday.\n\nThe short answer seems to be: Higher.\n\nDoes that mean the selling frenzy that hit stocks this past week is over? Give it a little time, maybe a week.\n\nFutures trading started Sunday evening in a rush but was softening a little just before midnight ET.\n\nIt's a week to be thankful\n\nThis week is all about holidays and maybe a little time to stop watching how your 401(k) is doing.\n\nU.S. financial markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving. Friday's stock trading will close at 1 p.m.\n\nThough trading hours will be regular on Wednesday, trading volumes will be seriously light because many traders and investors will depart early from their computer screens to get ahead of the holiday traffic, whether by land, sea or, most importantly, air.\n\nAnd maybe they'll be thankful just for a break. The past week was traumatic for many people watching their investments. Here's how key markets ended:\n\nStandard & Poor's 500 Index. Up 1% on Friday, down nearly 2% on the week and down 3.4% in November. Nasdaq Composite Index. Up 0.9%% on Friday, down 2.7% on the week and down 6.1% in November. Dow Jones Industrial Average. Up 1.1% on Friday, down nearly 1.9% on the week and down 2.8% in November. Bitcoin. Down 2.1% on Friday, down 10.3% on the week and down 20.5% so far in November.\n\nThe question many investors may have ked is: Where in the heck did this turmoil come from? Especially after Nvidia, the rockstar of semiconductors and world's most valuable company, reported blowout earnings after Wednesday's close. The shares opened higher on Thursday and then slid backward, taking the entire stock market with it until, finally, the Friday rally started a rally started \u2014 and held.\n\nRelated: T. Rowe Price insists investors will find 2026 less stressful\n\nStock prices are largely determined by corporate revenue and earnings and the state of the economy. The third quarter results have proved to be quite robust. U.S. corporate revenues are tracking to show an increase of 8.4% for the quarter, according to FactSet, potentially the best quarter since the third quarter of 2022, when revenues jumped 11%.\n\nBut the selling pressure was set off because many analysts, money managers and investors began to think stocks were getting way ahead of themselves. The S&P 500 is up nearly 37% since the bottom of the Trump Tariff panic in early April. The Nasdaq is up 51% since then. Google-parent Alphabet is nearly 110%. Nvidia is up 107%.\n\nA blunter fear is that stocks are in bubble territory and ready \u2014 or near ready \u2014 to tumble. Or maybe not.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRay Dalio, one of the great money managers, thinks markets are in bubble territory, but probably not ready to sell. Someone must have to unload stocks for the bubble to break. That's not happening, he said on a CNBC interview on Thursday as Nvidia was rising.\n\nBitcoin was overbought for most of the spring and summer, and investors, who understood the asset's history of volatility, started to sell after its early October peak. This past week's 10.3% slump caused its relative strength index to drop below 30 for most of the last week, a traditional signal of an asset may be oversold.\n\nIt bounced up after hitting 25 on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, many Americans are unhappy. They don't like rising retail prices, sky-high housing costs, beloved local eateries disappearing seemingly overnight, battles over healthcare and divided politics and waves of large layoffs. Warnings from corporate bosses that artificial intelligence may wipe out millions of jobs doesn't cheer them much, either.\n\nRelated: AARP has blunt warning for Americans on Social Security\n\nWhat's ahead on earnings\n\nAll that said, the week ahead is still filled with some key earnings, and many Americans will start their holiday shopping in earnest. (At least that what the likes of Walmart, Target, Macy, Best Buy and Costco are all hoping.) Automakers are heavily advertising year-end sales.\n\nAmong the key earnings to watch are:\n\nMonday: Agilent Technologies; control-systems designer Woodward, Inc., and Zoom Communications.\n\nTuesday: Chipmaker Analog Devices, electronics giant Dell Technologies, cyberscaler Zscaler, retailers Best Buy, Dicks Sporting Goods and Abercrombie & Fitch, and food company J.M. Smucker.\n\nWednesday: Deere & Co., the farm-equipment giant and discount retailer Kohl's.\n\nEconomic reports to watch\n\nNow that the government is up and running, there are economic reports again. Reports form the government may reflect data that's at least a month old, but it's data.\n\nThe key reports are:\n\nTuesday: Producer Price Index from the Labor Department, retail sales from the Commerce Department and three non-government reports: the S&P Case Shiller Home-Price Index for September, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November and the National Association of Realtors' Pending Home Sales Index.\n\nWednesday: Initial Jobless Claims for the week of Nov. 22 from the Labor Department and Durable Goods Orders, a report reflecting September data.\n\nFriday: The Chicago Business Barometer, published by the Institute for Supply Management in the Midwest.

Brooke De Palma, come under you.\n\n00:13 Speaker B\n\nDefinitely what I'm looking out for is the consumer. I want to see the consumer spend this holiday season. We're getting some early projections from companies and firms like KPMG saying that consumers will spend about 4.6% more this year versus last year. That's about $850 more per a shopper. And that's momentum, especially in this environment where we're hearing all about tariffs impacting consumer's ability to spend. Of course, keep in mind, prices will be higher as well. So that's certainly weighing into that. But also, in about just about 10 minutes or so, we're going to hear more from the University of Michigan, their consumer sentiment index, and what we heard last time was that consumers are not feeling too good about this economy right now. And so, ultimately, how the consumer is holding up in this environment is all eyes for me towards the end of the year.\n\n01:03 Speaker A\n\nAngela, over to you real quick.\n\n01:07 Speaker C\n\nYeah, I think for for markets and risk assets in general, what the Fed decides to do in December is going to be a really important factor. There's a lot of debate around that, but I think the direction of travel is lower for interest rates, maybe though at a gradual pace.\n\n01:23 Speaker A\n\nSorry, Jen. Sorry, Jen.\n\n01:27 Speaker D\n\nWell, we we all know I am the Fed correspondent for this network and I think there's two major catalysts that we're looking for. Uh one that you talked about in depth earlier in the show, which is AI and the momentum there. But the other is, of course, the Federal Reserve and whether they execute that third rate cut for this year. That seemed to be in question with that September jobs report. But John Williams of the New York Fed gave the market a present today because he put it back on the table. He said there is room for a further downward adjustment towards neutral in the near term. So, we know he's part of that key troika with Chair Powell and Jefferson, who's the vice chair of the Fed. That leads me to believe that that clump of Fed governors, uh who I was sort of questioning could go either direction, may start to lean towards that cut even as the regional Fed Bank presidents, uh four of them, Goolsby, Schmid, uh, Musalem, and Collins have leaned more hawkish. Uh so you could see a a rate cut that could take the market on that Santa Claus rally through the end of the year. Of course, still kind of a coin flip at this point, but it's it's looking better now that we heard from Williams this morning.\n\n02:30 Speaker A\n\nGood to see the clumps at the Fed leading.

The data for the last decade bodes well for Thanksgiving week 2025. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nThis week is Thanksgiving week, which is a holiday-shortened week for the U.S. stock market. The market will be closed on Thanksgiving Day -- Thursday, Nov. 27 -- and will close at 1 p.m. on the following day, known as \"Black Friday.\"\n\nFrom an investing standpoint, investors have reason to be thankful. In 2025 through Friday, Nov. 21, the S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index have gained 12.3% and 15.3%, respectively. Their total returns (which include dividends) are 13.6% and 16%, respectively, over this period. These returns are somewhat higher than the stock market's long-term historical average of about 10%.\n\nI was wondering whether the stock market tends to outperform, underperform, or perform about as expected during Thanksgiving week, relative to the year in general. So, I decided to dig into this question.\n\nTo be clear -- The Motley Fool espouses long-term investing. Moreover, timing the market is very difficult, so I don't recommend it. Nonetheless, I believe all knowledge is beneficial.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDoes the stock market tend to outperform, underperform, or perform about as expected during Thanksgiving week?\n\nThere are usually 52 weeks in each year (every five or six years, there are 53 weeks in a year). So, there are usually 52 trading weeks (of varying lengths) each year. Thus, if the stock market performed about as expected on a given Thanksgiving week, it would roughly correspond to 1/52nd of that year's performance. For example, if, in a given year, the S&P 500 index (the best proxy for the overall U.S. stock market) gained 26%, a Thanksgiving week gain of roughly 0.5% would be about as expected.\n\nI looked at the past 10 years to determine an answer to my question. While 10 years is not a very long time, it at least includes both up and down years, so it has some variability.\n\nI'll give you my findings upfront: The stock market tends to outperform during Thanksgiving week, relative to its annual performance, based on data from the past 10 years. There are likely several reasons for this phenomenon, though I won't speculate on them.\n\nLet's examine the data for the past decade. I'll be using stock market index gains and losses, rather than returns. My source for all charts is YCharts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nYear 2024\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 23.3%. Nasdaq Composite annual performance: Gain of 28.6%. Thanksgiving week (see chart below) performed better than expected, relative to the annual performances.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2023\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 24.2%. Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 43.4%. Thanksgiving week performed better than expected for the S&P 500 and about as expected for the Nasdaq, relative to the annual performances.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2022\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Loss of 19.4%. Nasdaq annual performance: Loss of 33.1%. Thanksgiving week performed significantly better than expected, relative to the annual performances.\n\nThe stock market had a bad year in 2022. Many companies were plagued by supply chain issues following the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This stemmed mainly from the fact that the U.S. and much of the world depended on China for parts and, in some cases, finished goods. And China completely shut down its economy several times during the pandemic.\n\nMany of the stocks that surged during the initial periods of the pandemic (discussed further in the 2020 section below) got clobbered in 2022.\n\nInflation -- which began increasing in 2021-- was surging in 2022 and peaked in June 2022. The rising inflation was probably mainly due to two factors -- the supply chain issues and government stimulus spending during the pandemic.\n\nAnother lesser factor in 2022's poor stock market performance may have been Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2021\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 26.9%. Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 21.4%. Thanksgiving week performed worse than expected, relative to the annual performances.\n\n2021 was a strong year for the stock market, which experienced a particularly bad Thanksgiving week. What appeared to happen here is that the market became very choppy, with notable ups and downs, in late November and December 2021. The market's struggles at the end of 2021 were prescient of the poor 2022 that was to come. Indeed, the market began a steady decline as the calendar turned from 2021 to 2022.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2020\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 16.3%. Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 43.6%. Thanksgiving week performed much better than expected, relative to the annual performances.\n\nStocks fell sharply from mid-February through late March due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it didn't take long for them to come roaring back. The Nasdaq index significantly outperformed the S&P 500 because most of the stocks that benefited from the pandemic -- dubbed \"coronavirus stocks\" or \"stay-at-home stocks\" -- are listed on the Nasdaq index. These stocks included image-sharing social media company Pinterest and videoconferencing specialist Zoom Communications.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chip leader Nvidia is another Nasdaq-listed stock that benefited from the pandemic, with its shares soaring 122% in 2020. Not only was its data center platform growing rapidly, but its gaming platform also experienced significant growth, as many people were staying home more during the pandemic. At that time, the company's gaming platform generated more revenue than its AI-driven data center platform.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2019\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 28.9%. Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 35.2%. Thanksgiving week performed better than expected, relative to the annual performances.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2018\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Loss of 6.2%. Nasdaq annual performance: Loss of 3.9%. Thanksgiving week performed much worse than expected, relative to the annual performances.\n\nThe stock market rose through most of 2018 but steadily declined from October through late December. Several factors contributed to this decline, including concerns about slowing economic growth and the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, and rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2017\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 19.4%. Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 28.2%. Thanksgiving week performed better than expected, relative to the annual performances.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2016\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 9.5%. Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 7.5%. Thanksgiving week performed significantly better than expected, relative to the annual performances.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2015\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Loss of 0.7% (essentially, flat). Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 5.7%. Thanksgiving week performed about as expected for the S&P 500, and slightly better than expected for the Nasdaq, relative to the annual performances.^SPX Chart\n\nSummary\n\nOver the past decade, the stock market (as represented by the S&P 500 index) has experienced gains in seven years, losses in two years, and remained essentially flat in one year. These numbers also apply to the week of Thanksgiving.\n\nThanksgiving week, however, performed better than would be expected, relative to the S&P 500's full-year performance, in seven out of 10 years. It underperformed in only two years and performed about as expected in one year, relative to the S&P 500's full-year performances.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Management believes the company can grow its data center division at a 60% CAGR over the next five years. It may become a trillion-dollar company by 2030 as a result. 10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices \u203a\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has been a successful investment since the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race began in 2023, with its stock rising from about $60 to around $250 today. That's about a 213% rise, which is an impressive return in three years. But several companies have delivered far better returns over that time, including AMD's chief rival, Nvidia.\n\nHowever, the tables may have turned, as AMD is becoming more competitive and may be able to steal some of the data center money that Nvidia is capturing. All of this was revealed during AMD's Financial Analyst Day, and it included some monster projections that have investors like me considering buying the stock.\n\nAMD's stock price could be significantly higher by 2030 if the company achieves these targets, making the stock a worthy investment today.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAMD's data center growth will rapidly accelerate\n\nAMD hasn't seen nearly the success that Nvidia has during the AI arms race. While Nvidia's data center division grew revenue at a 66% pace during Q2 FY 2026 (ending October 26), AMD's data center revenue rose only 22% year over year in Q3. This growth disparity is odd, especially considering that AMD's data center revenue totaled only $4.3 billion versus Nvidia's $51.2 billion. Normally, smaller companies can grow faster because a big sale can deliver outsize growth, but that isn't the case here.\n\nThe primary difference between AMD's and Nvidia's artificial intelligence computing units lies in the software that controls them. While each produces graphics processing units (GPUs) with incredible capabilities, Nvidia's CUDA software was light-years ahead of AMD's ROCm software. However, AMD is making headway in this realm, and has rapidly improved the software so that it's at least competitive with CUDA. Once it can prove that this software is a viable alternative, AMD will be able to capture a much larger part of the data center spending pie.\n\nThis is huge news for AMD investors, as AI data center capital expenditures aren't expected to slow down for many years. But what will that do to AMD's stock five years from now?\n\nAMD will be a nearly a trillion-dollar company if its projections pan out\n\nOver the next five years, AMD expects unbelievable growth to emerge from its data center division. It expects a 60% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for its data center business. That's a huge acceleration from today's growth levels, but AMD is more than just a data center business.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAMD also has a large Client and Gaming division that sells OEM hardware as well as aftermarket upgrades for the consumer PC market. During Q3, AMD's data center division delivered $4.3 billion in revenue, while Client & Gaming produced $4 billion, so the difference is not significant. It also has an embedded processor division that contributed $857 million to the total.\n\nAMD doesn't expect either of these divisions to grow fast over the next five years, as it projects a 10% CAGR through 2030. That significantly drags down the overall growth rate, but AMD still expects a CAGR of 35% overall.\n\nWith AMD's revenue over the past 12 months totaling $32 billion, that's $155 billion in revenue by the end of 2030.AMD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThat's monster growth, but what kind of stock price can investors expect to come with it? If AMD also delivers the $20 in earnings per share that it projects, and the stock is valued at 30 times earnings (which is less than its forward P/E of 50 at this writing), that indicates a stock price of $600. With AMD's current stock price hovering around $200 with a market cap of $330 billion, AMD's stock could grow at a 140% pace and nearly become a $1 trillion company.\n\nThat is an impressive return in five years, and few stocks will achieve it. If AMD's management team is right about its trajectory, then AMD stock is a must-buy here.\n\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

His vision about where accelerated computing can take the global economy and individual countries in terms of progress, productivity, and the potential elimination of poverty and disease -- not least of which includes his command of some of the most talented and passionate engineers on the planet.\r\n\r\n2. His willingness to get on a jet several times a month to visit his partners and customers across the globe, from Beijing, Korea, and Taiwan to Saudi Arabia, London and Washington, DC -- all in an effort to manage relationships and explain the AI transformation that must happen, with or without NVIDIA GPUs.\r\n\r\nThe Quarter That Didn't Impress\r\n\r\nBefore NVIDIA's Q3 report last week I pointed out that sales forecasts by analysts for next year were still way too low at $275 billion and I told my followers and journalists that six months from now that number would be over $325 billion.\r\n\r\nWhile the beat-and-raise quarter met selling and uncertainty, the analysts had to crunch the numbers in their spreadsheet models... and what did they do?\r\n\r\nYep, they raised next fiscal year from $275B to a consensus of $293B with the high estimate moving up to $327B.\r\n\r\nSee my preview here with very important comments from Jensen in his appearance at The Future of AI Conference in London two weeks ago...\r\n\r\nAI Bubble Talk is Cheap -- How to Navigate the Worry\r\n\r\nWhy Are Analysts So Timid About the AI Revolution?\r\n\r\nI don't know the precise answer to this question, but it could be fear about sticking one's neck out on the world's first $5 trillion company. Which is ridiculous considering I took the Street-high price target of $200 in June of 2024.\r\n\r\nI suspect it is also worry about the \"AI Bubble\" fears. Who wants to say NVIDIA shares are going to $300 when the current correction could take it to $150 soon?\r\n\r\nHere's what I told my TAZR Trader members last week...\r\n\r\nThe NVIDIA Conundrum\r\n\r\nIt was a great report and outlook from NVIDIA. And I'm surprised the stock is not trading over $200.\r\n\r\nClearly, large investors are worried about something else. I'll just provide my notes today and we'll go from there.\r\n\r\nRight after the conference call, I spoke with journalist Shannon Carroll from Quartz.\r\n\r\nWe talked for about 30 mins and toward the end she wanted to know, despite my exuberance, if there was anything in the report or on the call that bothered me.\r\n\r\nI went back through my notes and looking at the half-dozen analyst questions from major houses.... I said \"No. It's their job to look for chinks in the armor and none could find any.\"\r\n\r\nIf they want to quibble about margins potentially slipping, all I can say is that when you are innovating on a one-year cadence that the hyperscalers keep demanding -- and you are doing 5 different very complex things to improve networking -- of course margins could slip from 75% to 70%.\r\n\r\nBut that should not impact the value and growth proposition of the #1 provider of AI infrastructure. This is not the fickle consumer iPhone cycle.\r\n\r\nCassandra Speaks\r\n\r\nMichael Burry, who goes by Cassandra Unchained on X, was obviously NOT on the conference call. Or maybe he was and didn't want to admit it. Either way, he should have said so when he posted this afterward along with the now infamous Bloomberg infographic of the \"circular AI spending\"...\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery company listed below has suspicious revenue recognition. The actual chart with ALL the give-and-take deals would be unreadable. The future will regard this a picture of fraud, not a flywheel. True end demand is ridiculously small. Almost all customers are funded by their dealers. If you can name OpenAI's auditor in 1 hour you win some pride.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf you need to see the graphic, I posted it on the \"whiteboard in my garage\" over at Skool.\r\n\r\nCooker's take: Burry may eventually be right. The pockets of questionable excess in debt already got exposed for ORCL & CRWV. But I think he\u2019s overall at least 2 years early.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA Conference Call Highlights: The AI Bull is Alive & Well\r\n\r\nHere were my notes I posted over on Skool the morning after...\r\n\r\nJust got off phone with Bloomberg journalist Carmen Reinicke. Had a great chat about all-things NVIDIA. Some things I emphasized...\r\n\r\n>>CFO Colette Kress with her bull horns on emphasizing Jensen's October GTC grandslam call for $500 billion in Blackwell and Rubin sales for 2025 and 2026.\r\n\r\nColette mentioned this was on track in her opening remarks. But the first question on call came from Joe Moore at Morgan Stanley about if this meant roughly another $350 billion to go over next 5 quarters and if there was any possibility of upside.\r\n\r\nColette grabbed the question with bullish gusto, citing being on track and \u201cBut we would be not finished if we didn't say that we'll probably be taking more orders. For example, just even today, our announcements with Saudi Arabia and that agreement in itself is 400,000 to 600,000 more GPUs over three years. Anthropic is also new. So there's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced.\u201d\r\n\r\nCooker's take: I have new respect for Colette. Plus analysts are still way behind on next year's topline estimate which needs to climb from $275B to $325B. I like the new framing since GTC for the potential of 50% market share of a $3-4 trillion TAM in 2030.\r\n\r\n>>As always, Jensen has a lot of explaining to do. But he's really teaching investors and analysts how to think about this transformational technology shift. This isn't about tweaking models for when the iPhone market might be saturated and sales peak.\r\n\r\nHe explains why datacenters need to be reinvented and rebuilt from the ground up to build enterprise economics on the new paradigm of accelerated compute. And he covers the Agentic-AI landscape for knowledge work and the needs of sovereign nation-states to not only control their own data, but to be able to mine and model it for growth and security.\r\n\r\nBut he didn't mention the massive compute needs of Physical-AI when billions of autonomous machines will be mingling with humans in factories, roads, workplaces, smart cities and smart homes. He needs to say this when explaining what an \"AI Factory\" is for like he did in London last week.\r\n\r\nThat's how I think he needs to get the market's mind off of the OpenAI black hole, and focused on what is happening for the global economy at an unprecedented scale and rate of change! Jensen is quietly screaming \"We could do 50% market share of our $3-4 trillion TAM in 2030!\" but I think he's getting tired of explaining that it's because this technology shift is like no other.\r\n\r\n>>ORCL and CRWV became the \"OpenAI proxies\" for the market to punish excess in the upside down debt pyramids.\r\n\r\n>>I\u2019m surprised the price target bumps are so timid. But one of the highest bumps, to $320, came from Ben Reitzes with Melius who was on the call and asked a tough question about NVIDIA using its cash flow to invest in the ecosystem partners: \"I think there's there's just a lot of confusion out there about how these how these deals work and your criteria for doing those, like the Anthropic, the OpenAI's, etcetera.\"\r\n\r\n>> In response to Ben's question, Jensen also emphasized how they are feeding the developer ecosystem. This has been a big key to success since the 2010's when Gaming dominated. Get them building on CUDA and they will never leave! And they will tell their enterprise bosses the same!\r\n\r\n>>Awesome quotes from Jensen:\r\n\r\n\"When you are growing at the rate we are, how could anything be easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We created a whole new industry. Our success will drive the economics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blackwell sales are off the charts. Cloud GPUs are sold out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now we own it all.\" (in reference to partnerships with anyone serious about accelerated compute)\r\n\r\nBe sure to join me over on Skool at my whiteboard where I also show some key slides from the Jensen Manifesto.\r\n\r\nHere's a good example of analyst reactions...\r\n\r\nTruist: 'NVIDIA Remains \"THE\" AI Company' PT to $255\r\n\r\nThis is from William Stein, one of my top 5 semiconductor analysts from way back...\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe believe Nvidia has significant additional growth & stock upside potential. NVDA delivered a clean beat & raise qtr.\r\n\r\nTwo more major factors influence our model: takeaways from GTC-DC, and management's increasingly believable assertion that AI is not in a bubble, reinforcing its 50% AI TAM CAGR outlook and $3-4T TAM by 2030.\r\n\r\nSo, our CY26 EPS goes to $7.30 (from $6.50) and PT to $255 (from $228) based on 35x (2x prem. to peers). We believe meaningful upside potential persists from (1) ASP increases for Rubin, (2) unit upside potential that comes through CY26, (3) potential ability to ship to China.\r\n\r\nBottom line on NVIDIA: Long-term investors are getting an excellent opportunity to buy NVDA near $175.

More investors are growing anxious about the bubble and circular investing patterns in the AI space.\n\nBridgewater founder Ray Dalio believes artificial intelligence spending is entering bubble territory, but he cautions investors against dumping their holdings for now, as quoted on CNBC.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sell just because there\u2019s a bubble,\u201d Dalio said Thursday on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box. He explained that while high valuations normally result in lower long-term returns, a bubble alone should not be the reason to exit now. He added that something specific must trigger the burst, and that catalyst hasn\u2019t hit the market yet.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Surge Fuels Market Optimism\n\nAI leader NVIDIA jumped more than 5% after posting strong earnings and upbeat guidance on Nov. 19, 2025 after the market closed. CEO Jensen Huang overruled bubble fears, insisting the company sees a different trajectory for AI growth. However, NVIDIA lost 3.2% in the following trading session on Nov. 20, 2025.\n\nWhat Could Lead to the Bubble Bursting?\n\nDalio said it likely won\u2019t be tighter monetary policy. Instead, he pointed to the possibility of higher wealth taxes as a likely risk that could pop the bubble, as mentioned in the above-said CNBC article.\n\nHedging Matters\n\nDalio urged investors to broaden their portfolios, noting that gold remains a strong hedge. The metal has hit record highs this year, thanks to its safe-haven status. SPDR Gold Trust is up 52.7% so far this year and has lost about 0.6% over the past one month.\n\nThe S&P 500 is also not fully immune to the tech bubble fears. The S&P 500 is increasingly shaped by the performance of Big Tech. With about one-fourth of the S&P 500 allocated to information technology, broader U.S. market investors are not fully proofed against tech bubble concerns.\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that could help investors\u2019 portfolios if any tech-related risks are present.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCambria Tail Risk ETF\n\nThe Cambria Tail Risk ETF seeks to mitigate significant downside market risk. The Fund intends to invest in a portfolio of out of the money put options purchased on the U.S. stock market. The fund charges 59 bps in fees and yields 2.48% annually.\n\nAdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF\n\nThe AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF seeks capital appreciation through short sales of domestically traded equity securities. The fund charges 380 bps in fees and yields 7.25% annually.\n\nInvesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF\n\nThe underlying ICE USD Global High Yield Excluding US Issuers Constrained Index comprises U.S. dollar-denominated below-investment-grade corporate debt publicly issued in the U.S. domestic and euro bond markets by non-U.S. issuers. The fund charges 35 bps in fees and yields 6.63% annually.\n\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR ETF\n\nThe healthcare sector is a safe sector and should perform well in a high-risk environment. The underlying Health Care Select Sector Index includes companies from the following industries: pharmaceuticals; health care providers & services; health care equipment & supplies; biotechnology; life sciences tools & services; and health care technology. The fund charges 8 bps in fees and yields 1.60% annually.\n\nBoost Your Portfolio with Our Top ETF Insights\n\nZacks' exclusive Fund Newsletter delivers actionable information, top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, straight to your inbox every week.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on this valuable resource.
