When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level.  Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher \u2014 if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.\n\nThere are 22 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Johnson & Johnson, but the average is just that \u2014 a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $155.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $193.00.  The standard deviation is $10.169.\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average JNJ price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with JNJ crossing above that average target price of $175.77/share, investors in JNJ have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $175.77 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

You don't need to be as savvy as Buffett to have success in the stock market, because the right index fund can deliver spectacular long-term returns for patient investors. 10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett will retire from his role as CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway holding company at the end of 2025, where for the last 60 years he has overseen numerous wholly owned subsidiaries, in addition to a stock portfolio that's today worth $300 billion. Had you invested just $500 in Berkshire shares when he took the helm in 1965, it would be worth a staggering $24.8 million today.\n\nHowever, Buffett is a seasoned expert, and he knows the average investor would struggle to replicate his incredible ability to pick stocks. Therefore, he often recommends they buy a low-cost exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks a diversified index like the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) instead.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is one great option he has named in the past. Here's how it could turn a consistent investment of $500 per month into $1 million over the long term.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA great index fund for investors of all experience levels\n\nThe S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy. The index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning its largest constituents have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft are the world's most valuable companies, with a combined market capitalization of $11.9 trillion, and all three are in the information technology sector. Hence, this is the largest sector in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.\n\nHere are the top five sectors in the index, along with their weightings, and some of their most noteworthy stocks.\n\nSector Sector Weighting Noteworthy Stocks Information technology 35.06% Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple Financials 13.03% Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Communication services 10.32% Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix Consumer discretionary 10.05% Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's  Healthcare 9.75% Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie\n\nData source: Vanguard, State Street. Sector weightings are accurate as of Nov. 19, 2025, and are subject to change.\n\nThe other six sectors in the S&P 500 are industrials, consumer staples, energy, utilities, real estate, and materials, so the index is highly diversified.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, it's hard to ignore the significant influence of the information technology sector. The S&P 500 soared by 214% over the last 10 years, and the information technology sector was responsible for more than half of that overall gain, thanks to its own eye-popping return of 640%. In fact, if we exclude the sector entirely, the S&P's return over the last decade shrinks to just 79%.\n\nThis dynamic is likely to remain in place thanks to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, quantum computing, and more, which could fuel significant returns in stocks like Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the most cost-effective ways for investors to gain like-for-like exposure to the S&P 500. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. In dollar terms, an investment of $10,000 would incur an annual fee of just $3, whereas that fee could be as high as $74 in other funds, according to Vanguard.\n\nTurning $500 per month into $1 million\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered a compound annual return of 10.5% since its inception in 1957, and if it continues to grow at that pace, it could turn a consistent monthly investment of $500 into $1 million in under 30 years:\n\nMonthly Investment Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $500 $106,829 $409,298 $1,269,709\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nThe S&P has delivered an even better average annual return of 14.4% over the last five years, as themes like AI fueled incredible growth for some of the index's largest constituents, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and more. Just last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors that annual AI infrastructure spending could hit an eye-popping $4 trillion by 2030, so momentum in this space is unlikely to slow anytime soon.\n\nHowever, even though the S&P might continue generating accelerated returns over the next few years, it's also important to remember that volatility is a normal part of the investing journey. According to Capital Group, the index experiences a decline of 10% or more once every two and a half years, on average, and it slips into a bear market (a decline of 20% or more) every six years. These bumps in the road are the price of admission for an opportunity to earn life-changing returns over the long term.\n\nThe key to success is investing consistently, even during uncertain times. Warren Buffett is known for buying stocks in all market conditions, but especially during periods of weakness because as a value investor, he loves a bargain.\n\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

Independent Franchise Partners US Equity (IFPUX) returned 23.23% year-to-date with Oracle as its only tech holding. Vanguard Utilities Index Fund (VPU) returned 19.31% year-to-date with zero tech stocks in its portfolio. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nA Magnificent 7 AI Bubble?\n\nOne of the most talked-about topics of late is the fear of an AI bubble. Trillions of dollars have been committed to its development, and its rapid ascent has stoked fears by a number of savvy market watchers and insiders that the AI industry is wildly overvalued, similar to the dotcom bubble that burst a quarter century ago.\n\nThe huge 16% bull run of the S&P 500 year-to-date is over 50% fueled by the Magnificent 7 tech stocks, which are all tied to AI development.\u00a0 WIthout Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Amazon and Meta Platforms, the S&P 500 is only showing a roughly 7% year-to-date gain. On this past Thursday, November 20th, the S&P 500 erased -$1.5 trillion in market cap between 10:40 AM ET and 12:20 PM ET. That equates to -$15 billion PER MINUTE for 100 minutes straight. Although the market recovered partially, it\u2019s interesting to note that there was no news when this occurred. Therefore, this may have been signs that there are cracks in the dam and more leaks will follow.\n\nGiven the wide range of growth ETFs with tech exposure often containing Magnificent 7 stocks, investors seeking a diversification hedge or a growth play without an AI component are in luck. There are a number of funds that fit that description, and some of them are even delivering superior YTD returns. Two such examples are: Independent Franchise Partners US Equity\u00a0 (NASDAQ: IFPUX) , which is a mutual fund, and Vanguard Utilities Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE: VPU), an ETF.\n\nIndependent Franchise Partners US EquityZhanna Hapanovich / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough the structure of mutual funds prevent maximizing AUM for investment due to redemption liquidity requirements, IFPUX is a non-tech fund that is beating the S&P 500 by 7 points in year-to-date returns.\n\nAlthough they are not often featured in 24/7 Wall Street, mutual funds of exceptional performance that warrant inclusion will receive coverage. IFPUX, which, at the time of this writing, sports a 23.23% YTD return, falls into that category. With Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) its sole technology stock, IFPUX has managed to outperform the S&P 500 by focusing on \u201cthe S&P\u00a0 493\u201d, as its fund manager, Richard Crosthwaite, explained. The primary IFPUX focus criteria for portfolio inclusion when selecting a stock is for the prospective company to possess an intangible competitive advantage, such as a series of patents, that has proven itself against its rivals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIFPUX has achieved its gains with an overweighting of 36.32% in telecom, 18.42% consumer defensive, and 16.42% in healthcare, across 150 stocks held overall. The top five (5) holdings are:\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb - 4.98% Corteva - 4.98% Intercontinental Exchange - 4.91% Kenvue - 4.32% Z - 4.24%\n\nAdditional IFPUX details are as follows:\n\nYTD Return 23.23% Morningstar Rating 5-Stars Yield 1.64% Portfolio Turnover 28.77% NAV $22.63 Expense Ratio 0.66% Net Assets $1.72 billion 1-Year Return 25.23% Beta 0.98 3-Year Return 25.92% Inception Date 12-20-2011 5-Year Return 16.41%\n\nVanguard Utilities Index Fund ETF Shareszhengzaishuru / iStock via Getty Images\n\nThe utilities sector has displayed a strong upswing since the Trump Administration has refocused on reliable oil and gas and cut taxpayer funded subsidies for erratic solar and wind power.\n\nThe utilities industry has seen a positive bump from several sources:\n\n1) The surge of electricity demand from the proliferation of data centers and EVs;\n\n2) The return to reliable fossil fuels and reduction of less profitable and reliable solar and wind power;\n\n3) The interest rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve lowered borrowing costs for businesses, with energy being a critical component.\n\nThe Vanguard Utility Index Fund ETF Shares is passively managed and both tracks and replicates the MSCI US Investable Market Utilities 25/50 index, which features large, mid, and small-cap utility stocks. As one might imagine, VPU contains zero tech stocks. Nevertheless, it has notched a 19.31% YTD return to date.\n\nVPU\u2019s top 10 stocks make up 52% of the total portfolio, and features many household name utility companies:\n\nNextEra Energy - 10.38% Constellation Energy - 6.89% The Southern Company - 6.67% Duke Energy - 6.42% Vistra Corp. - 4.44% American Electric Power - 4.01% Sempra - 3.92% Dominion Energy - 3.48% Xcel Energy - 3.11% Exelon Corp. - 3.03%\n\nAdditional VPU details include:\n\nYTD Return 19.31% Avg Daily Volume 169,531 shares Yield 2.62% Expense Ratio 0.09% NAV $190.99 1-Year Return 11.20% Net Assets $9.64 billion 3-Year Return 11.57% Beta 0.66 5-Year Return 9.99% Inception Date 1-26-2004 10-Year Return 10.81%\n\nThe Magnificent 7 stocks have been a wildly profitable ride for millions of investors. However, all stocks, over the long haul, have cycles of ups and downs. Michael Burry, renowned for his \u201cBig Short\u201d analysis which predicted the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and subsequent banking meltdown of 2008, is publicly short Nvidia, which is the AI industry\u2019s biggest darling. As others start to perceive that the Magnificent 7 stocks have overinflated valuations, investors may want to look more closely at diversifying at least a portion of their holdings in non-Magnificent 7 funds, such as IFPUX and VPU, among many others.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

All of these companies are C-Corps. In the MLP space, I prefer Western Midstream (WES [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WES]) and MPLX (MPLX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPLX]) over everyone else.\n\nRoberts Berzins [https://seekingalpha.com/author/roberts-berzins-cfa]: Given the record highs of largest indices (SPY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY]) (QQQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ]) and the overall excitement about the potential productivity gains from the AI, it would be only prudent to add a bit of defense in the portfolio.\n\nBy defense I mean concrete picks, which are uncorrelated to the AI stocks, like high-quality, long-duration REITs, such as in the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (VNQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ]). The premise here is that if the AI-concentrated market starts to plunge, the long-term Treasury yields should go up. And if the economy fell into recession, odds would be high that the Fed would embark on quantitative easing, which is also positive for Treasury yields.\n\nFor REITs like Realty Income (O [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O]), this is exactly what is needed to drive up valuations, given the inherently high-duration factors that stem from long-term, relatively fixed leases. Plus, by deploying capital into O, investors would be able to access an attractive dividend yield of 5.6% that is underpinned by an upper investment grade balance sheet and cash flows that are desynchronized from the AI play.\n\nMORE ON SPDR S&P 500 ETF TRUST, INVESCO QQQ TRUST ETF, ETC.\n\n \t* The AI Bubble Hangover: Distinguishing The Revolution From The Ruin [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846299-the-ai-bubble-hangover-distinguishing-the-revolution-from-the-ruin]\n \t* The Tardy September Jobs Report Shows Overall Weakness [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846276-the-tardy-september-jobs-report-shows-overall-weakness]\n \t* Cracks Are Developing In The 'Everything' Bubble [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846260-cracks-developing-in-the-everything-bubble]\n \t* Wall Street's slide likely driven by signals in crypto - Fundstrat's Lee, IBKR's Sosnick [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524686-wall-streets-slide-likely-driven-by-signals-in-crypto---fundstrats-lee-ibkrs-sosnick]\n \t* Volatility spikes to a one month high as market sentiment shifts sour [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524592-volatility-spikes-to-a-one-month-high-as-market-sentiment-shifts-sour]\n\n ", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524699-sa-what-are-the-best-defensive-stocks-right-now?utm_source=feed_news_all&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;feed_item_type=news", "symbols": ["AM.US", "ENB.US", "EPRT.US", "JNJ.US", "KMI.US", "MPLX.US", "MRK.US", "NNN.US", "O.US", "OKE.US", "PEP.US"], "tags": ["BALANCE SHEET", "CONSUMER", "CONSUMER-STAPLES", "CONSUMER\u00a0", "DEFENSIVE-STOCKS", "DIVIDENDS", "ENERGY\u00a0", "FINANCIALS", "FINANCIALS\u00a0", "HEALTHCARE\u00a0", "MIDSTREAM", "REITS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.037, "neu": 0.812, "pos": 0.151}}, {"date": "2025-11-23T14:05:25+00:00", "title": "Notable healthcare headlines for the week: Abbott, Medtronic, Merck and J&amp;J in focus", "content": "Wall Street staged a rebound on Friday, closing the session in positive territory after a turbulent, tech-driven downturn rattled the Nasdaq Composite just a day earlier.\n\nFriday's market boost was supported by reports that the Trump administration is considering allowing the sale of H200 GPUs to China [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525093-nvidia-shares-erase-losses-as-trump-floats-idea-of-selling-h200-gpus-to-china-report#source=url_first_level%3Amarket-news%7Csection%3Amarket-pulse%7Csection_asset%3Afull_story%7Cbutton%3Abody_link].\n\nOn Friday, the tech focused Nasdaq Composite closed higher by 0.86%.

Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Johnson & Johnson.\n\nWhat Wall Street Has Been Saying\n\nRecent analyst commentary underscores growing attention on Johnson & Johnson's evolving fundamentals, highlighting both renewed optimism and areas of cautious scrutiny as the company enters a new phase of execution and strategic transformation.\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Bullish Takeaways\n\nScotiabank initiated coverage on Johnson & Johnson with an Outperform rating and a $230 price target, naming J&J as its top large-cap biopharma pick. The analyst cited strong execution, innovation momentum in treating life-threatening diseases, and the company's increased growth visibility. Argus raised its price target to $210 from $185, noting robust Q3 results, upcoming product launches, and new indications for existing therapies. The separation of the orthopedics business is highlighted as a driver of improved margins and faster growth. Raymond James raised its price target to $209 from $174 and maintained an Outperform rating, emphasizing confidence in J&J's strong pipeline and the company\u2019s ability to drive a new growth phase after the divestiture of slower-growth units. TD Cowen increased its price target to $222 from $185, citing solid performance and guidance upgrades. The analyst contends that separating the ortho business is expected to boost both revenue growth and margins. RBC Capital raised its target to $209 from $185, maintaining an Outperform rating. Analysts pointed to improved MedTech fundamentals, manageable litigation, and a strong trajectory in innovative medicine. Wells Fargo upgraded J&J to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $212 price target, reflecting reduced concerns over pharmaceutical tariffs, pricing risks, and Stelara's loss of exclusivity. Guggenheim upgraded J&J to Buy from Neutral with a $206 price target, expressing comfort with how J&J navigated the Stelara exclusivity expiration and highlighting upside potential in both existing and pipeline assets. JPMorgan raised its price target to $195 from $185, continuing its Neutral stance but reflecting confidence in J&J\u2019s large-cap biopharma positioning.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Bearish Takeaways\n\nStifel raised its price target to $190 from $165 but maintained a Hold rating, citing the company\u2019s bullish commentary and improved growth outlook, yet remaining cautious on the stock\u2019s near-term upside. BofA raised its target to $204 from $198 while keeping a Neutral rating, noting that product pipeline advances are substantial but that valuation already prices in much of the upside, and key risks remain. Citi and other firms have noted recent headline risks, including lawsuits related to products such as Tylenol and baby powder, which may impact consumer sentiment and near-term financial performance.\n\nOverall, while the breadth of analyst commentary skews bullish, highlighting Johnson & Johnson\u2019s exceptional execution, decisive strategic steps, and robust pipeline, some reservations around valuation and litigation remain. The company's ongoing initiatives and solid operational trends have raised consensus price targets and contributed to an improved growth narrative, yet a minority of analysts continue to see upside as largely reflected in current valuations and are mindful of near-term headline and litigation risks.\n\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts?

Over the past couple of years, AI integration in the U.S. healthcare industry has increased manifold. According to an IDC report commissioned by Microsoft and released in March 2024, 79% of healthcare organizations were already utilizing AI technology.\n\nThis rapid integration has been evident through strategic partnerships between major pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly LLY, Johnson & Johnson JNJ and AbbVie ABBV, and AI-centric tech giants like Palantir PLTR and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nBy accelerating drug discovery, streamlining clinical trials, and automating administrative tasks, these AI collaborations are expected to cut billions in costs, enhance operational efficiency and enable faster breakthroughs. This, in turn, is likely to bolster the underlying healthcare stocks and, by extension, strengthen the performance of healthcare exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide exposure to them.\n\nNow, before suggesting healthcare ETFs that you may consider adding to your portfolio to benefit from AI-driven growth in the sector, let\u2019s take a closer look at these partnerships to understand how AI is transforming the healthcare industry.\n\nNotable Pharma-Tech Collaborations\n\nBig Pharma's accelerated AI adoption is best illustrated by its strategic collaborations with AI-centric tech stocks:\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 In October 2025, it was announced that Eli Lilly is partnering with NVIDIA to build an \"AI Factory,\" leveraging the NVIDIA Blackwell DGX SuperPOD to power the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to drug discovery. This is aimed at compressing decades of research into instantly accessible intelligence, dramatically accelerating the time from target identification to clinical candidate.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 JNJ has been working with NVIDIA for more than a year to scale AI for use in surgery. This collaboration is aimed at delivering real-time analysis and AI-powered insights within the operating room, using advanced computing platforms to enhance surgical decision-making and training. \r\n\r\nIn October 2025, the company revealed that it is using an AI-driven simulation to train clinical teams on the MONARCH robotic platform for urology. To achieve this, JNJ is leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac and Omniverse platforms to create high-fidelity digital twins of the system and patient anatomy, enabling teams to practice robot setup and simulate kidney stone procedures in a virtual operating room. The company is also using NVIDIA Cosmos for generating accurate, physics-based synthetic data, enhancing learning and procedure planning prior to surgery.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile, AbbVie uses Palantir's Foundry platform as the data management backbone (Fusion) for its global operations. Foundry allows AbbVie to unify disparate data sources, manage complex clinical trial data, and streamline supply chains, significantly boosting operational efficiency and accelerating drug development.\n\nThese deep, transformative collaborations between pharmaceutical and AI companies are creating a powerful flywheel effect of innovation and efficiency, directly aiding the growth prospects of the healthcare sector.\n\nHealthcare ETFs to Buy\n\nLooking ahead, the global AI in healthcare market \u2014 valued at $26.57 billion in 2024\u2014 is projected to reach $505.59 billion by 2033, at a CAGR of 38.81%, according to a report by Grand View Research. To capitalize on this AI-driven healthcare revolution, one can invest in the following couple of healthcare ETFs to tap the powerful growth opportunities offered\u00a0 by big pharma stocks, especially those mentioned above:\n\nVanguard Health Care ETF VHT\n\nThis fund, with assets worth $16.2 billion, offers exposure to 398 companies that are primarily involved in the research, development, production, and marketing of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products.

But despite that urgency, Rau acknowledges that science still takes time. New drug discovery can take well over a decade and well north of $2 billion, on average, before they can obtain regulatory approval.\n\nRau and Eli Lilly are betting that AI can speed things up. In late October, the company announced plans to create a new Nvidia-chip powered \u201csupercomputer\u201d and \u201cAI factory\u201d that will go online by early 2026, allowing scientists to utilize models trained on millions of experiments to test new therapies. Some of the proprietary AI models will be made available on Lilly TuneLab, a platform that Lilly launched in September that gives smaller biotech firms access to AI models that have been trained on the larger firm\u2019s research.\n\nSeparately, J&J on the same day, announced its own partnership with Nvidia, relying on the AI company\u2019s foundation models to create simulated environments for surgical teams to plan their kidney stone procedures. J&J says this application of so-called \u201cphysical AI\u201d will optimize the process to map out procedures, make it easier to train doctors, and will result in more consistent and better clinical outcomes for patients.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so many hours in the day,\u201d says Neda Cvijetic, senior vice president and global head of robotics and digital research and development for J&J\u2019s MedTech division. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s super helpful to see that difficult case in a very realistic, simulated environment first, to help best prepare.\u201d\n\nThe pharmaceutical and medical products industries can potentially unlock tens of billions in value from investments in generative AI alone if the sector is successfully able to deploy the technology to improve drug discovery, speed up clinical trials and the regulatory process, and more adeptly market and administer new treatments to the right patients.\n\nBut there still remains a bit of a gap between the highly specific AI use cases that are most powerful for the life sciences industry and the technologies that AI hyperscalers offer today. Recently, solutions have become more tailored for the sector, partly reflected by partnerships emerging between Eli Lilly and J&J with Nvidia, and also Novo Nordisk\u2019s relationship with Anthropic and Amazon Web Services, as well as AI hyperscaler\u2019s own efforts. Last month, Anthropic launched Claude for Life Sciences, which was designed to speed up R&D.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDelphine Zurikiya, a senior partner in both the life sciences and technology practices at McKinsey, said that until recently, AI hyperscalers were spending most of their time working with chief information officers. But as AI budgets have expanded and use cases proliferated, there\u2019s been more interest in business-specific applications for those technologies all across the pharmaceuticals industry.\n\n\u201cThe business leaders have less patience with generic platforms,\u201d says Zurikiya. \u201cThey\u2019ll want something that\u2019s customized to what they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even just want the life sciences knowledge model,\u201d says Rau. \u201cWe want one that knows Lilly.\u201d\n\nLilly\u2019s Chief AI Officer Thomas Fuchs adds that the greatest AI advancements will come from the combination of the company\u2019s trove of proprietary data, the compute investments Lilly is making to train large foundation models, and then deploying that tech to thousands of chemists and biologists, who can use those AI tools to make new discoveries.\n\nFuchs says that precise science can\u2019t be echoed for every large pharmaceutical company. That would be like an astronomer relying on a telescope sold by a big-box retailer. \u201cWe are building a space-based telescope,\u201d says Fuchs.\n\nKimberly Powell, a VP of healthcare at Nvidia who worked on the J&J surgical AI project, touts the potential for physical AI to tap the advancements of computer vision technology and large language models to turn AI into physical workers.\n\nWhile that may raise questions about the impact of AI on the job of a surgeon, Powell points to data from the World Health Organization that projects a shortfall of 11 million health workers globally by 2030. She also predicts that a new operating room\u2014a hybrid mix of human surgeons working alongside physical robots and digital agents\u2014could result in breakthroughs in new procedure techniques.\n\n\u201cThere is a future goal of how we go from robotic-assisted surgery to robotic surgery, where the robot is actually taking some action on its own,\u201d says Powell. \u201cWe\u2019re laying all the groundwork to do that.\u201d\n\nJohn Kell\n\nSend thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0CIO Intelligence here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-big-pharma-teaming-ai-173612559.html", "symbols": ["JNJ.BA", "JNJ.BE", "JNJ.DU", "JNJ.F", "JNJ.HM", "JNJ.MU", "JNJ.MX", "JNJ.US", "JNJB34.SA", "LILY34.SA", "LLY.BE", "LLY.F", "LLY.MU", "LLY.MX", "LLY.US", "NVDA.US"], "tags": ["AI", "BIOTECH", "DRUG-DISCOVERY", "HEALTHCARE", "PHARMA"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.007, "neu": 0.893, "pos": 0.101}}, {"date": "2025-11-19T17:24:46+00:00", "title": "Why Johnson &amp; Johnson's Share Price Is Popping This Month", "content": "Key Points\n\nJ&J beat Wall Street estimates on sales and profits in the third quarter.

It refers to the resistance that the blood must overcome to flow through the pulmonary circulation, that is, the blood vessels in the lungs.\n\nMerck is planning to present these findings from the CADENCE study at a future scientific conference and begin phase III studies on Winrevair in the given patient population.\n\nPreliminary analysis indicates that the safety outcomes seen in the CADENCE study were generally similar to the known safety profile of Winrevair.\n\nMRK Stock's Performance\n\nYear to date, shares of Merck have lost 2.9% against the industry\u2019s growth of 14.3%.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWinrevair was approved by the FDA to treat PAH, WHO Group 1, in March 2024 based on data from the STELLAR study. The drug was approved for a similar use in the European Union in August 2024.\n\nRecently, the FDA approved an update to the Winrevair product label in the United States based on data from the ZENITH study, which evaluated the drug in patients with PAH, WHO Group 1 functional class (\u201cFC\u201d) III or IV at high risk of mortality.\n\nFollowing the FDA nod for this expanded indication, Winrevair became the first PAH therapy to have an indication that includes components of the clinical worsening events: hospitalization for PAH, lung transplantation and death.\n\nMRK Pin Hopes on Winrevair Amid Looming Keytruda LOE\n\nMerck\u2019s blockbuster PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, has played a key role in driving its steady revenue growth over the past few years. The drug recorded sales of $23.3 billion in the first nine months of 2025, up 8% year over year.\n\nHowever, Keytruda intravenous (\u201cIV\u201d) formulation is set to face loss of exclusivity (\u201cLOE\u201d) in 2028. Given the heavy reliance and the upcoming LOE of Keytruda IV, Merck has been looking for ways to diversify its product portfolio, especially by growing the non-oncology business to navigate the potential challenges once the inhibitor loses exclusivity.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong its new products, Merck is pinning hopes on Winrevair to boost its long-term growth.\n\nWinrevair recorded sales worth $976 million in the first nine months of 2025. The positive data from the CADENCE study are likely to provide a label expansion opportunity for Winrevair in a new patient population.\n\nGiven that Winrevair has already witnessed a strong launch so far, a potential label expansion should drive sales in 2026 and beyond, helping Merck build its long-term growth trajectory post the Keytruda LOE period.\n\nWinrevair is also being evaluated in the phase III HYPERION study for recently diagnosed adult patients with PAH, WHO Group 1 FC II or III at intermediate or high risk of disease progression.\n\nMRK's Competition in the PAH Market\n\nHowever, Winrevair faces stiff competition in the PAH market.\n\nSignificant players in the PAH market are United Therapeutics UTHR and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.\n\nUnited Therapeutics markets four drugs to treat PAH in the United States \u2014 Remodulin, Orenitram, Tyvaso and Adcirca. UTHR\u2019s Tyvaso recorded sales of $1.41 billion, while Remodulin and Orenitram generated sales of $398.8 million and $375.7 million, respectively, in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nJ&J\u2019s key PAH drugs include Opsumit and Uptravi. JNJ recorded revenues of $3.25 billion from its PAH franchise in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. PriceMerck & Co., Inc. Price\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. price | Merck & Co., Inc.

Biotech stock GRAIL is one to watch, with its breakthrough cancer detection technology nearing FDA approval. Despite economic concerns, the American Dream is still attainable through long-term investing, saving, and strategic financial choices. Interested in GRAIL, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nRetail investors are understandably on edge after several sessions of market volatility. But bestselling author and Oxford Club strategist Alexander Green, in his new book The American Dream, says we\u2019re still in one of the best times in history to build wealth\u2014especially if you think long-term and stay grounded in time-tested principles.\n\nAccording to Green, this pullback isn't as severe as it may feel. \u201cJust last Wednesday, the Dow hit an all-time high,\u201d he noted, explaining that recent selling pressure has more to do with valuation concerns and interest rate doubts than any fundamental breakdown.\n\n\u2192 3 Smart Defensive Stocks for an Uneasy Market\n\nWhy the Market Pulled Back\n\nGreen attributes the dip to two core concerns. First, investors are starting to question elevated tech and AI valuations, especially with earnings season calling those expectations into focus.\n\nSecond, inflation data and slower hiring have softened hopes that the Fed will cut rates in December. With the central bank emphasizing a \u201cdata-dependent\u201d posture, markets are less certain that relief is coming this year.\n\n\u2192 Why Home Depot\u2019s Pain Could Be a Long-Term Investor\u2019s Gain\n\nWhy Selling Now Might Be the Wrong Move\n\nInstead of trying to predict where things are heading next week, Green encourages investors to zoom out. He calls himself \u201ca long-term optimist,\u201d and points out that historically, the market\u2019s trend is up and to the right.\n\nFor traders, a little caution might be warranted in the short term. But for long-term investors, these dips are often windows to buy high-quality stocks at more attractive prices.\n\n\u2192 3 Companies to Watch as Natural Gas Stocks Make a Comeback\n\nInsider Buying Can Point the Way\n\nOne of the most reliable indicators in times like these? Insider buying. Green suggests that when officers and directors\u2014people with access to non-public financials\u2014are putting money into their own companies, that\u2019s worth noting.\n\nHe recommends tracking insider trading activity to see which stocks corporate executives are buying, not just selling. While insiders aren\u2019t always right, their actions can serve as a useful signal when markets are in flux.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Biotech Breakout to Watch: GRAIL\n\nOne sector Green\u2019s focused on right now is biotech, where artificial intelligence is helping accelerate drug development and reduce costs. He highlighted one company in particular: GRAIL (NASDAQ: GRAL).\n\nSpun off from Illumina, GRAIL has developed the Gallery Test, which can detect more than 50 types of cancer from a simple blood draw. Green has even used the test himself and calls it \u201ca good feeling\u201d to know you\u2019re clear on so many deadly diseases\u2014especially ones like pancreatic cancer that often go undetected until late stages.\n\nWith FDA fast-track status and potential insurance reimbursement ahead, Green sees GRAIL\u2019s $3 billion market cap as just a starting point.\n\nThe Biotech Risk\u2014and Big Pharma's Appetite\n\nOf course, biotech comes with risk. Most drugs never make it past all three phases of trials. Still, larger pharmaceutical companies like Merck (NYSE: MRK), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Bristol Myers (NYSE: BMY) are actively acquiring promising small caps to replace expiring patents.\n\nGreen pointed to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) as a recent example.

Braun, and DePuy Synthes Lead Innovations by Continually Innovating and Improving Patient Outcomes", "content": "Company Logo\n\nKnee replacement surgery effectively addresses severe knee conditions like osteoarthritis, offering pain relief and improved mobility. The procedure sees high demand due to rising osteoarthritis among the aging population, especially as global lifespans increase. Although the surgery significantly enhances life quality, challenges such as high costs and lengthy recovery persist, affecting both patients and healthcare systems. The competitive market witnesses innovation from key players like Stryker, Zimmer Biomet, and Johnson & Johnson, advancing technologies such as robotic-assisted surgery and custom implants, which enhance surgical precision and patient outcomes.\n\nDublin, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Knee Replacement Surgery Market - A Global and Regional Analysis: Focus on Procedure Type, Product Type, Application, End User, Country, and Region - Analysis and Forecast, 2025-2035\" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\r\n\r\nKnee replacement surgery is a medical procedure designed to replace a damaged or worn-out knee joint with an artificial implant. It is typically recommended for patients suffering from severe knee conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or knee injuries, that cause pain, stiffness, and loss of function. The surgery involves removing the damaged parts of the knee joint and replacing them with prosthetic components made of materials like metal, plastic, or ceramic.\r\n\r\nThere are different types of knee replacement surgeries, including total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, and revision surgeries, each tailored to the severity and location of the damage. The procedure is typically followed by a rehabilitation process that includes physical therapy to restore strength, flexibility, and mobility.\r\n\r\nWhile knee replacement surgery offers significant benefits, such as pain relief and improved quality of life, it also carries some risks, including infection, blood clots, and implant failure. Technological advancements, such as robotic-assisted surgery and custom implants, have improved surgical precision and patient outcomes, making knee replacement a highly effective solution for restoring knee function and alleviating chronic pain.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary drivers of the knee replacement surgery market is the rising prevalence of knee osteoarthritis and other degenerative joint diseases, particularly among the aging global population.

The company beat estimates for both earnings and sales. While sales rose 9.1% year over year, earnings declined 38% due to costs related to acquisitions. AbbVie raised its revenue and EPS guidance for 2025 for the third time this year, backed by strong momentum year to date.\n\nHowever, AbbVie\u2019s stock declined post earnings release, probably due to softer sales of oncology drugs and continued weakness in its Aesthetics unit.\n\nHowever, the stock has recovered after the Q3 dip and on Nov. 12, crossed the 50-day moving average. This may have confused investors about whether they should buy, sell or hold the stock post the dip.\n\nLet\u2019s understand the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in detail to make a proper investment decision.\n\nABBV\u2019s Successful New Drugs \u2014 Skyrizi and Rinvoq\n\nAbbVie lost patent protection for its blockbuster drug, Humira, in the United States in January 2023 and in the EU in 2018. Humira's sales are declining due to LOE and biosimilar erosion. However, AbbVie has successfully navigated the loss of exclusivity (LOE) of the drug, which once generated more than 50% of its total revenues. It has accomplished this by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications, and should support top-line growth in the next few years.\n\nSkyrizi and Rinvoq generated combined sales of $18.5 billion in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nThe drugs are seeing strong performance across all approved indications, especially in the popular inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) space, which includes two conditions \u2014 ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD).\n\nSkyrizi sales are now annualizing at almost $18 billion and Rinvoq at more than $8 billion. AbbVie expects to outperform its target of combined sales of Skyrizi and Rinvoq of more than $25 billion in 2025 and more than $31 billion by 2027. Strong immunology market growth, market share gains and momentum from new indications, such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC, as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years, are expected to drive these drugs\u2019 growth.\n\nAbbVie recently settled patent litigation\u00a0with all generic manufacturers for Rinvoq, which extended the drug\u2019s patent exclusivity by four years to 2037.\n\nABBV\u2019s Oncology & Neuroscience Drugs Also Contributing\n\nAbbVie has built a substantial oncology franchise with Imbruvica and Venclexta. Its oncology segment generated combined revenues of $5.0 billion in the first nine months of 2025, up 2.7% year over year as higher sales of Venclexta and contributions from new drugs, Elahere and Epkinly, more than offset the decline in Imbruvica sales. Some key oncology drugs approved in the past couple of years are Epkinly and Emrelis. Elahere was added to AbbVie\u2019s oncology portfolio with the February 2024 acquisition of Immunogen. These three new drugs have strengthened AbbVie\u2019s oncology franchise.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAbbVie\u2019s neuroscience portfolio is also contributing to top-line growth. Sales of its neuroscience drugs increased 20.3% to almost $7.8 billion in the first nine months of 2025, driven by higher sales of Botox Therapeutic, depression drug Vraylar and newer migraine drugs Ubrelvy and Qulipta.\n\nThe initial international launch of Vyalev in Parkinson\u2019s disease is encouraging, and the company\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease franchise, comprising Vyalev and once-daily oral treatment tavapadon (under review in the United States), is being seen as a key to growth in neuroscience.\n\nOver the next couple of years. AbbVie expects new product approvals for tavapadon and pivekimab sunirine (blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm) and pivotal data readouts for key pipeline candidates, lutikizumab, Temab-A and etentamig.\u00a0 These pipeline programs have the potential to drive long-term growth for AbbVie, while Skyrizi and Rinvoq will boost near-term growth.\n\nAbbVie on an Acquisition Spree\n\nAbbVie has been on an inorganic growth track over the past couple of years to bolster its early-stage pipeline, which should drive long-term growth. Particularly, it is signing several M&A deals in the immunology space, its core area, while also entering into some early-stage alliances in oncology and neuroscience. AbbVie has executed more than 30 M&A transactions since the beginning of 2024. In a key recent deal, it acquired private biotech, Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals' bretisilocin, a novel, investigational therapy for major depressive disorder. The agreement will strengthen its neuroscience pipeline.\n\nABBV\u2019s Struggling Aesthetics Segment & Humira Erosion\n\nSales of Humira are declining due to biosimilar erosion. The launch of Humira biosimilars in the United States in 2023 significantly eroded the drug\u2019s sales in 2024, with the decline being sharper in 2025 and expected to continue in 2026 as more plans excluded branded Humira and moved to exclusive biosimilar contracts. Humira sales declined more than 50% in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nAbbVie is seeing decreasing sales of the Aesthetics unit. AbbVie\u2019s global sales of its aesthetics portfolio declined 0.6% in 2024 and 7.4% in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nContinued macro challenges and low consumer sentiment, especially in the United States, as concerns about the economy and inflation weigh on discretionary spending, are hurting aesthetics sales. Juvederm sales fell 14.6% in 2024 and 16.7% in the first nine months of 2025. Botox Cosmetics sales declined 7.4% in the first nine months of 2025. AbbVie now expects category growth to be below previous expectations.\n\nOn the third-quarter conference call, AbbVie lowered its expectation for its Aesthetics business from $5.1 billion to $4.9 billion due to greater-than-expected market softness globally.\n\nABBV Stock Price, Valuation and Estimate Revision\n\nABBV stock has risen 31.6% this year so far compared with an increase of 14.2% for the industry. The stock has also outperformed the sector and the S&P 500 Index, as seen in the chart below.\n\nABBV Stock Outperforms Industry, Sector & S&P 500Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nABBV Stock Valuation\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, AbbVie is reasonably priced. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company\u2019s shares currently trade at 16.74 forward earnings, lower than 16.81 for the industry. The stock is trading above its five-year mean of 13.36. \u00a0AbbVie stock seems cheaper compared to other large drugmakers, such as Eli Lilly LLY, J&J JNJ and AstraZeneca AZN, following their results.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has declined from $11.15 per share to $10.63, while that for 2026 has decreased from $14.41 to $14.39 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nABBV Estimate MovementZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStay Invested in ABBV Stock\n\nAbbVie combats its share of headwinds, like Humira LOE impact, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and continued macro woes for Aesthetics. However, the company has faced its biggest challenge \u2014 Humira\u2019s patent cliff \u2014 quite well and looks well-positioned for continued strong growth in the years ahead. AbbVie is returning to robust revenue growth in 2025, which is just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE, driven by its ex-Humira platform.\n\nSales of AbbVie\u2019s ex-Humira drugs rose more than 20% (on a reported basis) in the third quarter, which was above its expectations, driven by Skyrizi, Rinvoq and neuroscience.\n\nBoosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through 2029, as it has no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade. A substantial portion of this growth is expected to be driven by the robust performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In the first nine months of the year, its total revenues rose 8.2%, in line with its expectation of mid-single-digit revenue growth. With no significant LOEs in this decade, AbbVie enjoys the flexibility to invest more in R&D to continue to acquire external innovation.\n\nAbbVie recently increased its quarterly cash dividend by 5.5%. Though estimates have declined, we believe that it is due to costs related to acquisitions, which should eventually boost growth.\n\nRising stock price, a decent valuation, expectations for continued strong earnings growth and a robust pipeline are good enough reasons to stay invested in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson & Johnson falls in, has gained 9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Johnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.53 per share, indicating a change of +24% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.9%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.48 indicates a change of +5.7% from what Johnson & Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson & Johnson.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Johnson & Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $24.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7%. The $93.69 billion and $98.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.5% and +5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nJohnson & Johnson reported revenues of $23.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.8%. EPS of $2.8 for the same period compares with $2.42 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.03%. The EPS surprise was +1.08%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson & Johnson.

(NASDAQ: COO) (\u201cCooper\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), today delivered a letter to the Board of Directors of Cooper (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and launched a website for shareholders www.CooperInFocus.com.\n\nThe full text of the letter follows:\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors,\n\nWe are writing to you on behalf of Browning West, LP (\u201cBrowning West\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, or \u201cwe\u201d), an investment management firm that has invested over $500 million in The Cooper Companies, Inc. (\u201cCooper\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). Browning West invests selectively in market leading businesses that have the potential to become value creation case studies. We operate with an owner\u2019s mentality and invest with a five-to-ten-year time horizon. Our stake in Cooper makes us one of the Company\u2019s largest investors.1\n\nCooper operates two market leading businesses: CooperVision, the world\u2019s largest contact lens business by number of wearers, and CooperSurgical, which includes the world\u2019s largest fertility medical devices business. These businesses have durable growth tailwinds: half the world, or nearly five billion people, may become myopic by 2050 and one in six people may experience infertility at some point in their lives.2\n\nDespite occupying solid positions in attractive industries with growth tailwinds, Cooper has meaningfully underperformedthe S&P 500, S&P 500 Health Care, and S&P 500 Health Care Equipment and Services indices over the past 1, 3, and 5-year periods.3In our view, Cooper\u2019s (i) lack of strategic focus, (ii) misaligned incentive structure, and (iii) inadequate Board oversight have led to value-destructive capital allocation, flawed execution, and failure to meet financial guidance. From 2019 to 2024, Cooper posted poor operating results: total revenue increased 47% but non-GAAP EPS grew only 20%, less than half the rate of revenue growth, and Free Cash Flow (FCF) declined from $421 million to $288 million.4 Cooper\u2019s P/E multiple has collapsed to a decade-low level of 16x.5\n\nStory Continues\n\nBrowning West believes that urgent change at the Board level is required to refocus and optimize Cooper\u2019s business, restore shareholder confidence, and help Cooper realize its significant long-term potential. Through the course of our research, we have compared notes with some of Cooper\u2019s large and long-tenured shareholders who have also expressed deep concerns about the Company\u2019s poor performance and governance. In addition, while we are encouraged to see another shareholder publicly express that Cooper\u2019s strategy and structure need to be overhauled, we believe the current Board does not possess the required sector expertise, leadership and operational experience, or capital allocation acumen to properly evaluate any strategic alternatives for the Company.\r\n\r\nI. Lack of Strategic Focus\n\nIn our experience, the best performing companies focus on one business at which they excel and expand only into strategic adjacencies that enhance their competitive advantage. Conversely, we believe unfocused companies inevitably perform poorly and languish. Unfortunately, Cooper currently fits squarely into this category of unfocused companies.\n\nWe believe Cooper\u2019s lack of focus has created a culture of complacency at both CooperSurgical, which management recently acknowledged was inefficiently run, and CooperVision.6 As one illustration of this point, we estimate that CooperVision\u2019s employee count is significantly higher than that of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Vision Care segment, a business (including surgical) that generates nearly twice CooperVision\u2019s revenue.7 In our view, Cooper\u2019s current structure dilutes management focus and has led to poor execution, evidenced by management\u2019s inability to meet its own guidance. Earlier this year during Cooper\u2019s fiscal Q1 earnings call in March 2025, Cooper\u2019s leadership team stated that \u201c[1% organic growth in CooperSurgical\u2019s Fertility segment] was a blip, and we expect fertility to return to high single-digit to low double-digit growth for the remainder of the year\u201d. Cooper\u2019s Fertility segment subsequently grew only 2% and 3% organically in the two quarters that followed.8 In August, Cooper\u2019s share price fell 13% after CooperVision delivered its lowest quarterly organic growth rate over the past decade (outside of COVID) and Cooper\u2019s leadership team lowered organic growth guidance for CooperVision for the second consecutive quarter.9\n\nWe have studied Cooper extensively and conducted more than one hundred conversations with vision care and fertility industry executives over the past few years. Our diligence, including interviews with Cooper\u2019s management team and former employees, reveals that there is no strategic or financial logic to operating CooperVision and CooperSurgical under the same corporate structure. Despite management\u2019s pursuit of \u201cOneCooper\u201d initiatives, which were intended to improve margins, CooperVision and CooperSurgical have demonstrated no meaningful synergies, and overhead expenses have instead deleveraged since 2019.10 Cooper\u2019s leadership team has been repeatedly questioned by equity research analysts about its puzzling corporate structure over the past decade, reinforcing that this is a widely held point of confusion by those analyzing the business.11\n\nWe firmly believe that Cooper\u2019s future should be as a highly focused pure-play vision care company, which would enable Cooper to reaccelerate and maximize organic growth in its CooperVision business across both its private label and branded contact lens offerings. Accordingly, under a refreshed Board, Cooper should reassess and improve operating plans for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and thoughtfully evaluate strategic alternatives for CooperSurgical, which we believe may attract strategic and financial sponsor interest for its various segments due to its attractive end-market exposure. We also note that the Company appears to be evaluating a restructuring plan; however, we urge the Company to pause all such efforts until our recommended directors are seated so that any restructuring is appropriately optimized in scope and magnitude.\n\nII. Misaligned Incentive Structure\n\nCooper\u2019s incentive structure has encouraged what we consider a \u201cgrowth at all costs\u201d approach and a misallocation of capital because it does not incorporate any FCF or Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) criteria. We believe this flawed incentive structure, without regard for FCF or ROIC, has contributed to a significant destruction of shareholder value. Specifically, this structure incentivized Cooper\u2019s leadership team to invest approximately $4 billion over the past decade in CooperSurgical at a cumulative ROIC of below 5%.12 Furthermore, in our conversations with the Company, we were surprised that management could not define maintenance versus growth capital expenditure and could not clearly articulate the ROIC on approximately $1.7 billion of capital expenditure invested in CooperVision from 2019 to 2024.\n\nShareholders also continue to be whipsawed by Cooper management\u2019s stated aspirations versus achieved outcomes. In September 2024, Cooper\u2019s leadership team revealed at a Wall Street conference that Cooper is \u201cvery, very focused\u2026[on] free cash flow generation\u201d.13 The same month, Cooper\u2019s leadership team sold over $25 million in stock. Cooper\u2019s year-to-date FCF remains below 2019 levels despite a 54% increase in revenue during the same period and the Company has missed its quarterly guidance multiple times this year. Shareholders have suffered a 35% decline in Cooper\u2019s share price since September 2024 while Cooper\u2019s management team has earned tens of millions of dollars in annual compensation.14\n\nIII. Inadequate Board Oversight\n\nCooper\u2019s Board has rewarded Cooper\u2019s leadership team as it pursued value-destructive acquisitions and misallocated capital, which has led to Cooper\u2019s shares underperforming the S&P 500 by over 100 percentage points in the past five years.15 The Board lacks critical vision care, manufacturing, and medical device expertise, which we believe impedes the Board\u2019s ability to provide effective oversight of the Company and assess Cooper\u2019s prospective strategy and capital allocation plans, including M&A. Cooper has added five new directors to the Board since 2020 but failed to recruit any executives with vision care experience or medical device public company CEOs with track records of value creation.\n\nCooper\u2019s Chairman and former CEO Robert Weiss, whom the Board claims is \u201cindependent\u201d, is substantially over-tenured having served on Cooper\u2019s Board for nearly three decades. While Cooper\u2019s shareholders have endured dramatic underperformance, Mr. Weiss has sold over $100 million of Cooper stock since 2019.16 After presiding over several years of value destruction and capital allocation blunders, Cooper\u2019s current Chairman and Board no longer have the mandate to make critical strategic and capital allocation decisions on behalf of shareholders.\n\nCooper Requires A Refreshed Board To Refocus the Company, Align Incentives With Long-Term Shareholder Value Creation Drivers, And Unleash Cooper\u2019s Full Potential\n\nDespite Cooper\u2019s underperformance, we are optimistic about Cooper\u2019s future, and our sizable investment reflects our conviction in Cooper\u2019s long-term value creation potential. Browning West has significant experience in enhancing corporate governance, recruiting and incentivizing management teams, and optimizing capital allocation. However, before making any critical decisions to determine Cooper\u2019s future, it is essential that the Board first establish the right foundation and leadership. Therefore, we would like to collaborate with you to enact the necessary Board refreshment and have identified four highly qualified director candidates with relevant sector expertise and strong value creation track records to join Cooper\u2019s Board immediately:\n\nWalter (Walt) M. Rosebrough, Jr.: Mr. Rosebrough is CEO Emeritus and Senior Advisor of Steris plc, a $27 billion enterprise value global medical devices business focused on infection prevention products and services. During Mr. Rosebrough\u2019s tenure as CEO from 2007 to 2021, Steris\u2019s stock generated a 10x total return or an 18% annualized return compared with a 10% annualized return for the S&P 500, and the company\u2019s market capitalization increased by over $20 billion. Mr. Rosebrough has an outstanding track record of value creation as a public company CEO and extensive experience in medical device manufacturing, leadership recruitment, M&A integration, and capital allocation.17We believe Mr. Rosebrough is eminently qualified to lead Cooper as its next Chairman and recommend that the Board elect Mr. Rosebrough as Mr. Weiss\u2019s successor.  Joseph (Joe) C. Papa: Mr. Papa is the CEO of Emergent BioSolutions, former Chairman and CEO of Bausch + Lomb (\u201cB+L\u201d), former Chairman and CEO of Bausch Health, and former Chairman and CEO of Perrigo. At Perrigo from 2006 to 2015, Mr. Papa generated a 7x total return or a 23% annualized return compared with a 7% annualized return for the S&P 500. Mr. Papa was instrumental in turning around Bausch Health and spinning off B+L, where he led the development and launch of B+L\u2019s first premium, daily disposable Silicone Hydrogel contact lens, Infuse. At Emergent BioSolutions, Mr. Papa has generated a 7x total return in his first 20 months as CEO. Mr. Papa has an outstanding track record of value creation as a public company CEO and extensive experience in vision care, medical device manufacturing, leadership recruitment, M&A integration, and capital allocation.18  Andrew (Andy) Pawson: Mr. Pawson is the former President and General Manager of the Global Vision Care Franchise of Alcon, the world\u2019s largest independent vision care company. At Alcon, Mr. Pawson led and coordinated functional collaboration across Commercial, R&D, Clinical, Safety, Regulatory, Legal, Manufacturing, and Supply Chain. From 2017 to 2023, Alcon\u2019s contact lens segment grew from $1.8 billion to $2.6 billion in revenue, and Alcon launched several premium contact lens products such as Dailies Total1 and Precision1. Mr. Pawson has extensive experience in vision care, medical device manufacturing, M&A integration, and capital allocation.19  Faraz Athar: Mr. Athar is a Partner of Browning West and plays a leading role in investment research and capital allocation at Browning West. Mr. Athar previously worked at investment firm Kinetic Partners, private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, and investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. Mr. Athar and the Partners of Browning West bring extensive recruitment and succession expertise, having co-led eight CEO or Chair searches at public companies. As a representative of a shareholder with a large investment and a long-term investment horizon, Mr. Athar will provide a viewpoint that is deeply aligned with the interests of all shareholders.\n\nBrowning West believes that each of these individuals will bring an urgently required shareholder-focused perspective and accountability to the Board. We believe that a refreshed Board can drive the critical initiatives required to unlock Cooper\u2019s latent potential and put the Company on a path to doubling its EPS over the next several years with a strong and sustainable growth trajectory. In our view, Cooper\u2019s share price may more than double as the Company\u2019s valuation multiple also improves due to a more focused strategy and upgraded Board. Cooper\u2019s refreshed Board will (i) reassess and improve operating plans including capital allocation at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical, (ii) evaluate strategic alternatives for CooperSurgical, (iii) review Cooper\u2019s organizational structure in light of Cooper\u2019s new focused strategy, and (iv) overhaul Cooper\u2019s incentive structure to align with long-term shareholder return drivers such as ROIC and FCF and focus leadership on driving profitable growth.20\n\nWe urge the Board to not make any reactive Board refreshments, leadership changes, or corporate actions including CooperVision or CooperSurgical M&A without consulting us. We are releasing this letter publicly to facilitate an immediate conversation with the Board and Cooper\u2019s shareholders about Cooper\u2019s future. We are available to meet with the Board at your earliest convenience to discuss our views in more detail. While we desire a constructive collaboration with the Board, we are prepared to take our case for change directly to shareholders at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nWe look forward to engaging with the Board and our fellow shareholders to chart the right path forward for Cooper.\n\nSincerely,\n\nUsman S.

(NASDAQ: COO) (\u201cCooper\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), today delivered a letter to the Board of Directors of Cooper (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and launched a website for shareholders\u00a0www.CooperInFocus.com.\n\nThe full text of the letter follows:\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors,\n\nWe are writing to you on behalf of Browning West, LP (\u201cBrowning West\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, or \u201cwe\u201d), an investment management firm that has invested over $500 million in The Cooper Companies, Inc. (\u201cCooper\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). Browning West invests selectively in market leading businesses that have the potential to become value creation case studies. We operate with an owner\u2019s mentality and invest with a five-to-ten-year time horizon. Our stake in Cooper makes us one of the Company\u2019s largest investors.1\n\nCooper operates two market leading businesses: CooperVision, the world\u2019s largest contact lens business by number of wearers, and CooperSurgical, which includes the world\u2019s largest fertility medical devices business. These businesses have durable growth tailwinds: half the world, or nearly five billion people, may become myopic by 2050 and one in six people may experience infertility at some point in their lives.2\n\nDespite occupying solid positions in attractive industries with growth tailwinds, Cooper has meaningfully underperformedthe S&P 500, S&P 500 Health Care, and S&P 500 Health Care Equipment and Services indices over the past 1, 3, and 5-year periods.3In our view, Cooper\u2019s (i) lack of strategic focus, (ii) misaligned incentive structure, and (iii) inadequate Board oversight have led to value-destructive capital allocation, flawed execution, and failure to meet financial guidance. From 2019 to 2024, Cooper posted poor operating results: total revenue increased 47% but non-GAAP EPS grew only 20%, less than half the rate of revenue growth, and Free Cash Flow (FCF) declined from $421 million to $288 million.4 Cooper\u2019s P/E multiple has collapsed to a decade-low level of 16x.5\n\nBrowning West believes that urgent change at the Board level is required to refocus and optimize Cooper\u2019s business, restore shareholder confidence, and help Cooper realize its significant long-term potential. Through the course of our research, we have compared notes with some of Cooper\u2019s large and long-tenured shareholders who have also expressed deep concerns about the Company\u2019s poor performance and governance. In addition, while we are encouraged to see another shareholder publicly express that Cooper\u2019s strategy and structure need to be overhauled, we believe the current Board does not possess the required sector expertise, leadership and operational experience, or capital allocation acumen to properly evaluate any strategic alternatives for the Company.\r\n\r\nI. Lack of Strategic Focus\n\nIn our experience, the best performing companies focus on one business at which they excel and expand only into strategic adjacencies that enhance their competitive advantage. Conversely, we believe unfocused companies inevitably perform poorly and languish. Unfortunately, Cooper currently fits squarely into this category of unfocused companies.\n\nWe believe Cooper\u2019s lack of focus has created a culture of complacency at both CooperSurgical, which management recently acknowledged was inefficiently run, and CooperVision.6 As one illustration of this point, we estimate that CooperVision\u2019s employee count is significantly higher than that of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Vision Care segment, a business (including surgical) that generates nearly twice CooperVision\u2019s revenue.7 In our view, Cooper\u2019s current structure dilutes management focus and has led to poor execution, evidenced by management\u2019s inability to meet its own guidance. Earlier this year during Cooper\u2019s fiscal Q1 earnings call in March 2025, Cooper\u2019s leadership team stated that \u201c[1% organic growth in CooperSurgical\u2019s Fertility segment] was a blip, and we expect fertility to return to high single-digit to low double-digit growth for the remainder of the year\u201d. Cooper\u2019s Fertility segment subsequently grew only 2% and 3% organically in the two quarters that followed.8 In August, Cooper\u2019s share price fell 13% after CooperVision delivered its lowest quarterly organic growth rate over the past decade (outside of COVID) and Cooper\u2019s leadership team lowered organic growth guidance for CooperVision for the second consecutive quarter.9\n\nWe have studied Cooper extensively and conducted more than one hundred conversations with vision care and fertility industry executives over the past few years. Our diligence, including interviews with Cooper\u2019s management team and former employees, reveals that there is no strategic or financial logic to operating CooperVision and CooperSurgical under the same corporate structure. Despite management\u2019s pursuit of \u201cOneCooper\u201d initiatives, which were intended to improve margins, CooperVision and CooperSurgical have demonstrated no meaningful synergies, and overhead expenses have instead deleveraged since 2019.10 Cooper\u2019s leadership team has been repeatedly questioned by equity research analysts about its puzzling corporate structure over the past decade, reinforcing that this is a widely held point of confusion by those analyzing the business.11\n\nWe firmly believe that Cooper\u2019s future should be as a highly focused pure-play vision care company, which would enable Cooper to reaccelerate and maximize organic growth in its CooperVision business across both its private label and branded contact lens offerings. Accordingly, under a refreshed Board, Cooper should reassess and improve operating plans for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and thoughtfully evaluate strategic alternatives for CooperSurgical, which we believe may attract strategic and financial sponsor interest for its various segments due to its attractive end-market exposure. We also note that the Company appears to be evaluating a restructuring plan; however, we urge the Company to pause all such efforts until our recommended directors are seated so that any restructuring is appropriately optimized in scope and magnitude.\n\nII. Misaligned Incentive Structure\n\nCooper\u2019s incentive structure has encouraged what we consider a \u201cgrowth at all costs\u201d approach and a misallocation of capital because it does not incorporate any FCF or Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) criteria. We believe this flawed incentive structure, without regard for FCF or ROIC, has contributed to a significant destruction of shareholder value. Specifically, this structure incentivized Cooper\u2019s leadership team to invest approximately $4 billion over the past decade in CooperSurgical at a cumulative ROIC of below 5%.12 Furthermore, in our conversations with the Company, we were surprised that management could not define maintenance versus growth capital expenditure and could not clearly articulate the ROIC on approximately $1.7 billion of capital expenditure invested in CooperVision from 2019 to 2024.\n\nShareholders also continue to be whipsawed by Cooper management\u2019s stated aspirations versus achieved outcomes. In September 2024, Cooper\u2019s leadership team revealed at a Wall Street conference that Cooper is \u201cvery, very focused\u2026[on] free cash flow generation\u201d.13 The same month, Cooper\u2019s leadership team sold over $25 million in stock. Cooper\u2019s year-to-date FCF remains below 2019 levels despite a 54% increase in revenue during the same period and the Company has missed its quarterly guidance multiple times this year. Shareholders have suffered a 35% decline in Cooper\u2019s share price since September 2024 while Cooper\u2019s management team has earned tens of millions of dollars in annual compensation.14\n\nIII. Inadequate Board Oversight\n\nCooper\u2019s Board has rewarded Cooper\u2019s leadership team as it pursued value-destructive acquisitions and misallocated capital, which has led to Cooper\u2019s shares underperforming the S&P 500 by over 100 percentage points in the past five years.15 The Board lacks critical vision care, manufacturing, and medical device expertise, which we believe impedes the Board\u2019s ability to provide effective oversight of the Company and assess Cooper\u2019s prospective strategy and capital allocation plans, including M&A. Cooper has added five new directors to the Board since 2020 but failed to recruit any executives with vision care experience or medical device public company CEOs with track records of value creation.\n\nCooper\u2019s Chairman and former CEO Robert Weiss, whom the Board claims is \u201cindependent\u201d, is substantially over-tenured having served on Cooper\u2019s Board for nearly three decades. While Cooper\u2019s shareholders have endured dramatic underperformance, Mr. Weiss has sold over $100 million of Cooper stock since 2019.16 After presiding over several years of value destruction and capital allocation blunders, Cooper\u2019s current Chairman and Board no longer have the mandate to make critical strategic and capital allocation decisions on behalf of shareholders.\n\nCooper Requires A Refreshed Board To Refocus the Company, Align Incentives With Long-Term Shareholder Value Creation Drivers, And Unleash Cooper\u2019s Full Potential\n\nDespite Cooper\u2019s underperformance, we are optimistic about Cooper\u2019s future, and our sizable investment reflects our conviction in Cooper\u2019s long-term value creation potential. Browning West has significant experience in enhancing corporate governance, recruiting and incentivizing management teams, and optimizing capital allocation. However, before making any critical decisions to determine Cooper\u2019s future, it is essential that the Board first establish the right foundation and leadership. Therefore, we would like to collaborate with you to enact the necessary Board refreshment and have identified four highly qualified director candidates with relevant sector expertise and strong value creation track records to join Cooper\u2019s Board immediately:\n\nWalter (Walt) M. Rosebrough, Jr.: Mr. Rosebrough is CEO Emeritus and Senior Advisor of Steris plc, a $27 billion enterprise value global medical devices business focused on infection prevention products and services. During Mr. Rosebrough\u2019s tenure as CEO from 2007 to 2021, Steris\u2019s stock generated a 10x total return or an 18% annualized return compared with a 10% annualized return for the S&P 500, and the company\u2019s market capitalization increased by over $20 billion. Mr. Rosebrough has an outstanding track record of value creation as a public company CEO and extensive experience in medical device manufacturing, leadership recruitment, M&A integration, and capital allocation.17We believe Mr. Rosebrough is eminently qualified to lead Cooper as its next Chairman and recommend that the Board elect Mr. Rosebrough as Mr. Weiss\u2019s successor. Joseph (Joe) C. Papa: Mr. Papa is the CEO of Emergent BioSolutions, former Chairman and CEO of Bausch + Lomb (\u201cB+L\u201d), former Chairman and CEO of Bausch Health, and former Chairman and CEO of Perrigo. At Perrigo from 2006 to 2015, Mr. Papa generated a 7x total return or a 23% annualized return compared with a 7% annualized return for the S&P 500. Mr. Papa was instrumental in turning around Bausch Health and spinning off B+L, where he led the development and launch of B+L\u2019s first premium, daily disposable Silicone Hydrogel contact lens, Infuse. At Emergent BioSolutions, Mr. Papa has generated a 7x total return in his first 20 months as CEO. Mr. Papa has an outstanding track record of value creation as a public company CEO and extensive experience in vision care, medical device manufacturing, leadership recruitment, M&A integration, and capital allocation.18 Andrew (Andy) Pawson: Mr. Pawson is the former President and General Manager of the Global Vision Care Franchise of Alcon, the world\u2019s largest independent vision care company. At Alcon, Mr. Pawson led and coordinated functional collaboration across Commercial, R&D, Clinical, Safety, Regulatory, Legal, Manufacturing, and Supply Chain. From 2017 to 2023, Alcon\u2019s contact lens segment grew from $1.8 billion to $2.6 billion in revenue, and Alcon launched several premium contact lens products such as Dailies Total1 and Precision1. Mr. Pawson has extensive experience in vision care, medical device manufacturing, M&A integration, and capital allocation.19 Faraz Athar: Mr. Athar is a Partner of Browning West and plays a leading role in investment research and capital allocation at Browning West. Mr. Athar previously worked at investment firm Kinetic Partners, private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, and investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. Mr. Athar and the Partners of Browning West bring extensive recruitment and succession expertise, having co-led eight CEO or Chair searches at public companies. As a representative of a shareholder with a large investment and a long-term investment horizon, Mr. Athar will provide a viewpoint that is deeply aligned with the interests of all shareholders.\n\nBrowning West believes that each of these individuals will bring an urgently required shareholder-focused perspective and accountability to the Board. We believe that a refreshed Board can drive the critical initiatives required to unlock Cooper\u2019s latent potential and put the Company on a path to doubling its EPS over the next several years with a strong and sustainable growth trajectory. In our view, Cooper\u2019s share price may more than double as the Company\u2019s valuation multiple also improves due to a more focused strategy and upgraded Board. Cooper\u2019s refreshed Board will (i) reassess and improve operating plans including capital allocation at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical, (ii) evaluate strategic alternatives for CooperSurgical, (iii) review Cooper\u2019s organizational structure in light of Cooper\u2019s new focused strategy, and (iv) overhaul Cooper\u2019s incentive structure to align with long-term shareholder return drivers such as ROIC and FCF and focus leadership on driving profitable growth.20\n\nWe urge the Board to not make any reactive Board refreshments, leadership changes, or corporate actions including CooperVision or CooperSurgical M&A without consulting us. We are releasing this letter publicly to facilitate an immediate conversation with the Board and Cooper\u2019s shareholders about Cooper\u2019s future. We are available to meet with the Board at your earliest convenience to discuss our views in more detail. While we desire a constructive collaboration with the Board, we are prepared to take our case for change directly to shareholders at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nWe look forward to engaging with the Board and our fellow shareholders to chart the right path forward for Cooper.\n\nSincerely,\n\nUsman S.

Increasing consumer preference towards self-medication and the prevalent popularity of OTC drugs for common ailments such as colds, allergies, digestive issues, and pain relief were thus the factors creating this dominance. The dietary supplement market became the fastest-growing segment due to increased consumer awareness of preventive healthcare, nutrition, and wellness.\n\nBy Distribution Channel\n\nThe offline distribution channel, including pharmacies, supermarkets, and specialty stores, accounted for over 60% of the market share in 2023. The dominance was attributed to the trust of the consumers in brick-and-mortar retail stores. The fastest-growing segment pertains to the online distribution channel, driven by increasing digital adoption, convenience, and access to a larger portion of healthcare products.\n\nNeed Any Customization Research on Consumer Healthcare Market, Enquire Now: https://www.snsinsider.com/enquiry/2880\n\nRegional Analysis\n\nNorth America was the leading region in the consumer healthcare market, accounting for 42.5% of the market share, due to high consumer awareness, strong healthcare infrastructure, and wide availability of OTC pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements.\n\nAsia Pacific is growing the fastest with rising disposable incomes, urbanization, and greater awareness about self-medication.\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nIn Oct 2024, Sanofi canceled its planned spin-off of its consumer healthcare business and is now in exclusive negotiations with U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) to transfer a controlling 50% stake in Opella.

Ion platform procedures surged 52% year over year to just under 38,000, far outpacing the still-strong 19% growth of da Vinci procedures. While da Vinci remains the financial backbone, Ion\u2019s accelerating adoption and expanding clinical validation signal a maturing segment with the potential to reshape ISRG\u2019s future revenue stack.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is expanding the platform\u2019s clinical advantage, driven by AI-enabled planning, real-time navigation and multimodal imaging. ISRG reported FDA clearance of new Ion software featuring real-time AI airway navigation and tomosynthesis to improve precision, especially in facilities without cone-beam CT.\n\nMore importantly, new data from the Zurich randomized controlled trial may significantly boost Ion\u2019s potential, as it demonstrated a diagnostic yield of 84.6% for Ion plus mobile cone-beam CT versus 23.1% for conventional bronchoscopy, despite nodules averaging only 11 mm. The study also showed a nearly 30-percentage-point jump in Stage 1A lung cancer detection after Ion adoption \u2014 exactly the type of upstream clinical impact that can structurally increase procedure volumes.\n\nLung cancer remains the world\u2019s deadliest cancer, and earlier-stage detection is the single biggest driver of survival and cost-efficiency. Ion is positioned directly in this clinical gap. Although da Vinci\u2019s installed base of nearly 10,800 systems remains far larger than Ion\u2019s roughly 950 systems, Ion\u2019s 14% utilization growth and its expanding AI-enabled capabilities suggest increasing throughput and more durable economics for pulmonary programs.\n\nAt present, Ion generates a much smaller portion of revenues than da Vinci\u2019s leading instruments-and-accessories segment. But if the Zurich trial data catalyzes stronger adoption across global lung screening programs, Ion could transition from a high-growth adjunct to ISRG\u2019s next scaled franchise \u2014 one capable of materially reshaping the company\u2019s long-term growth runway.\n\nPeer Updates\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s JNJ robotic-bronchoscopy platform, the MONARCH Platform, continues to advance significantly. J&J recently announced data from the TARGET study, which demonstrated that clinicians reached small, peripherally located lung nodules in 98.7% of cases and achieved an 83.2% diagnostic yield using the MONARCH system.\n\nIn March 2025, the company received FDA 510(k) clearance for the next-gen MONARCH QUEST upgrade, featuring AI-powered navigation (via NVIDIA RTX architecture) and integration with GE HealthCare OEC 3D mobile CBCT to enhance real-time targeting and precision. J&J has also secured regulatory clearance in China, making MONARCH the first minimally invasive robot-assisted lung procedure platform approved in that market. With these developments, J&J is positioning MONARCH as a frontrunner in enabling earlier lung lesion diagnosis and extending its procedural reach deeper into the lung periphery.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMedtronic plc\u2019s MDT bronchoscopy strategy centers on its ILLUMISITE Platform, a fluoroscopic navigation system (not yet a full robotic bronchoscopy system) that employs digital tomosynthesis and real-time CT-to-body divergence correction. Clinical data for ILLUMISITE show a 79.3% diagnostic accuracy at 12-month follow-up versus 73.6% for CT-guided biopsy, and substantially fewer complications (5.8% vs. 31%).\n\nThe platform also demonstrated near parity in diagnostic yield compared with the competitive Ion robotic system in the RELIANT trial (75.5% vs. 77.8%). While Medtronic has not yet publicly launched a dedicated robotic bronchoscopy system, it is actively investing in its broader robotics and AI hub and developing next-wave solutions across surgery.\n\nThus, for Medtronic, ILLUMISITE serves as a strong stepping stone in bronchoscopic navigation with robotic ambitions in view.\n\nISRG\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nShares of ISRG have gained 4.8% in the year-to-date period compared with 0.2% growth for the industry.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Intuitive Surgical trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 57.91, above the industry average.\u00a0But, it is still lower than its five-year median of 71.53.

Technological advancements in drug delivery systems and formulation technologies, including extended-release formulations and digital health integration, are driving innovation within the market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November 2023, Japan initiated a pilot program allowing the sale of emergency contraceptive pills, specifically NorLevo and its generic version levonorgestrel, without a doctor's prescription at 145 designated pharmacies nationwide. This move aimed to align Japan with over 90 countries where such medications are available over the counter. The trial was a response to longstanding advocacy for better access to emergency contraception, especially for women facing urgent needs due to contraceptive failure or sexual assault.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reported that between November 28, 2023, and January 31, 2024, a total of 2,181 emergency contraceptive pills were sold through the trial, according to a survey project report released by the ministry. The highest number of sales occurred in metropolitan Tokyo with 266 cases, followed by 231 in Kanagawa Prefecture and 169 in Osaka Prefecture. In contrast, five prefectures, including Yamaguchi and Yamagata, recorded fewer than 10 sales each.\n\nSurveys conducted among purchasers revealed that over 80% preferred the option to buy these pills directly from pharmacists without needing a doctor's prescription. Additionally, 91.8% of respondents expressed high satisfaction with pharmacist consultations, and 84.8% appreciated the attention to privacy during the purchasing process.\r\n\r\nThis market is marked by intense competition among key players, both multinational pharmaceutical companies and domestic firms. Competition centers around product innovation, brand reputation, and distribution networks, with companies heavily investing in R&D and marketing strategies to differentiate their offerings and secure market share.\r\n\r\nThe sector is propelled by factors such as technological innovation, changing demographics, and increased awareness of reproductive health. However, it faces challenges including cultural stigma and regulatory constraints. Despite these challenges, the market offers significant opportunities for growth and expansion. Companies must navigate this complex landscape and leverage emerging trends to address evolving consumer needs and preferences effectively.\r\n\r\nRising awareness and education are pivotal drivers of growth in the Japan Contraceptives Drugs Market. This trend significantly impacts consumer behavior, market dynamics, and overall demand for contraceptive products. Increased awareness and education about reproductive health enable consumers to make more informed decisions regarding contraceptive options. Comprehensive education programs, both in schools and through public health campaigns, provide individuals with detailed information about various contraceptive methods, their effectiveness, benefits, and potential side effects.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge empowers consumers to select the most suitable contraceptive methods based on their personal needs and preferences, thereby driving demand for a diverse range of products. According to the U.N., only 2.9% of Japanese women aged 15 to 49 use the monthly contraceptive pill, significantly lower than the 17.2% average across high-income countries. Additionally, the usage rate for IUDs in Japan is just 0.2%, compared to 6.5% in other high-income nations.\r\n\r\nEducation plays a crucial role in addressing and reducing misconceptions and stigma associated with contraception. In Japan, traditional views and cultural sensitivities may contribute to reluctance in discussing and adopting contraceptive methods. In Japan, only 0.9% of women use low-dose oral contraceptives (OC), a significantly lower adoption rate compared to 11.1% in the United States and 43.7% in Canada. Educational initiatives help to dispel myths and normalize conversations about contraception, leading to a more open and accepting attitude towards its use. As social stigma decreases and understanding increases, more individuals are likely to seek and utilize contraceptive products, boosting market growth.\r\n\r\nAs awareness of reproductive health issues grows, there is a corresponding increase in demand for preventive health solutions, including contraceptives. Education on the importance of family planning and the role of contraceptives in managing reproductive health contributes to a proactive approach among individuals. This shift towards preventive care drives higher adoption rates of contraceptives as people seek to manage their reproductive health more effectively and responsibly. Education about the long-term benefits of contraception and effective family planning encourages individuals to view contraceptives as an essential component of their overall health strategy.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how contraceptives can contribute to better health outcomes and more manageable family planning supports their adoption. Educational programs that highlight the role of contraceptives in achieving desired family sizes and spacing births further enhance market growth by emphasizing the benefits of planned and intentional family planning. Japan recorded a historic low of 720,988 births in 2024, marking the ninth consecutive year of decline.\r\n\r\nAs awareness increases, healthcare providers and institutions are better equipped to educate patients about contraceptive options. Training for healthcare professionals on current contraceptive methods and their applications ensures that they can provide accurate and comprehensive information to their patients. This professional guidance reinforces the importance of contraceptives and encourages their use, leading to higher market demand. Additionally, healthcare institutions often play a key role in disseminating information through community outreach and educational workshops.\r\n\r\nGovernment and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often lead initiatives aimed at improving reproductive health awareness. These organizations run campaigns, provide resources, and support public health programs that educate the population about contraception. Government subsidies and support for educational programs further enhance the reach and impact of these initiatives. As these organizations work to increase awareness, they contribute to a more informed and engaged consumer base, driving growth in the contraceptives market.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\nReport AttributeDetailsNo. of Pages82Forecast Period2024 - 2030Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024$721.08 MillionForecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030$1030 MillionCompound Annual Growth Rate6.2%Regions CoveredJapan\n\nReport Scope:\n\nKey Market Players\n\nPfizer Inc.Bayer AGMerck & Co., Inc.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc.Novartis AGGedeon Richter PlcAbbvie Inc.Lupin Limited\n\nJapan Contraceptives Drugs Market, By Drug Type:\n\nOral ContraceptivesInjectable ContraceptiveTransdermal PatchesVaginal RingsEmergency Contraceptives\n\nJapan Contraceptives Drugs Market, By Distribution Channel:\n\nHospital PharmaciesRetail PharmaciesOnline PharmaciesClinics\n\nJapan Contraceptives Drugs Market, By Region:\n\nHokkaidoTohokuKantoChubuKansaiChugokuShikokuKyushu\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/36kk7k\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\r\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

At the moment, there are 68 such companies. These firms are, in a sense, elite: they have demonstrated staying power and a consistent willingness to share the wealth of their enterprises with shareholders.\n\nHigh Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock? Is AOS fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nA dividend aristocrat is not, however, automatically a buy. Some companies stretch to maintain their payout, sometimes borrowing to fund it. Others may be paying out money that should go toward modernizing or improving the business. Here are five dividend aristocrats that I consider good buys today.\n\nA.O. Smith\n\nLook at the water heater in your basementthere's a fair chance it was made by A.O. Smith Corp. (NYSE:AOS).\n\nThe stock market hasn't been kind to A.O. Smith lately. Over the past year, the shares have fallen 9.5%. Over the past decade, they have returned 7.3% annuallyabout half the annualized return of the Standard & Poor's 500.\n\nYet I think highly of the company. Its return on equity, a key measure of profitability, is about 28%. I consider 15% good and 20% excellent.\n\nWhat's more, A.O. Smith has very little debt. Debt is only 12% of stockholders' equity, a reassuringly low figure.\n\nFranklin Resources\n\nFranklin Resources Inc. (NYSE:BEN) is a mutual fund giant managing roughly $1.6 trillion, mostly in stock and bond funds. Its performance has been even worse than A.O. Smith's: over the past decade, the annualized return on the stock has been 1%.\n\nTwo trends have hurt Franklin:\n\nThe rising popularity of index funds, while Franklin is known for actively managed strategies. The growth of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have taken market share from traditional mutual funds.\n\nIt's fair to say Franklin was late to the ETF party. But it now offers a broad range of ETFs, and I expect active management to regain some favor over time.\n\nJ.M. Smucker\n\nJ.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE:SJM) is best known for its namesake jams, but its biggest category is coffee, including the Folgers brand. Other major products include Milk-Bone and Meow Mix pet foods, Jif peanut butter, and Hostess snack cakes.\n\nThe stock is down about 2% this yearand about the same over the past decade. Smucker has several challenges, but one of themthe tariff on coffeeis about to be lifted. The Trump administration, responding to public anger over food prices, has said it will eliminate this tariff.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMy second reason for liking Smucker is less cheerful: I expect the U.S. economy to be in recession by May 2026. Consumer-staples companies like Smucker usually hold up reasonably well during recessions.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nBased in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the largest U.S. drug company by market value and calls itself the world's largest healthcare company.\n\nThe business is exceptionally profitable, with a net margin of 27% and a return on equity of 33%. Despite these strengths, the stock appears reasonably priced at 19 times earnings. Shares are up about 36% this year but had been stagnant for several years before that. Over the past decade, J&J has typically traded around 24 times earnings, so I consider it attractively priced today.\n\nGeneral Dynamics\n\nI have held General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE:GD) shares for years and have recommended the stock periodically. The large defense contractor should continue to benefit from increased military spending in Europe and strong public support for defense modernization in the U.S.\n\nFor that, the company can thank our adversariesVladimir Putin's Russia, Xi Jinping's China, Iran and North Korea. The stock is up about 32% year-to-date through Nov. 14, but I expect further gains.\n\nPerformance\n\nDepending on definitions, this is either the first or second column I've written about dividend aristocrats. Two years ago, I wrote about dividend kingscompanies that have raised their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nI recommended seven of those kings (which, by definition, are also aristocrats). They returned 21.5% in 12 monthsa result that normally would thrill me. However, the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index gained 24.3% over the same period.\n\nBear in mind that the results of my column are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with the results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance does not predict the future.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston. His firm or clients may own or trade securities discussed in this column.
