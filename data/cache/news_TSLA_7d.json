As of Nov. 21, 95% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts are expecting a 13.4% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year.\n\nExpectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30.Source: FactSet\n\nFollowing on the heels of retail earnings last week, reports from Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS), and Burlington Stores (BURL) in the upcoming week will provide further insight into whether worsening consumer sentiment is impacting purchasing decisions.\n\nOther reports across tech and other sectors will arrive from Zoom (ZM), Dell (DELL), Workday (WDAY), HP Inc.

While 83% of companies have reported a positive earnings surprise, it's the revenue growth in Q3 that stands out.\n\nButters notes that S&P 500 companies are reporting the highest revenue growth rate in three years.\n\nIf it holds, the S&P 500's current blended revenue growth rate of 8.4% in Q3 would be the highest mark since Q3 2022, when the index posted a revenue growth rate of 11%.\n\nThe Health Care, Financials, and Consumer Discretionary sectors have led the revenue growth trend, with companies such as Cardinal Health (CAH), Morgan Stanley (MS), Ford (F), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA), among many others, contributing significantly.S&P 500 revenue growth is tracking for the highest level in three years.

In the third quarter, Coatue trimmed its positions in several artificial intelligence (AI) giants, indicating that investors have become somewhat wary of the sector. However, Coatue's third-quarter 13F filing showed ownership in several recent initial public offerings that got off to a strong start earlier this year. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a tiger cub, meaning he's part of an elite group of investors who worked for Julian Robertson's Tiger Global Management in the 1990s and then went on to found his own fund, Coatue Management. Laffont made early investments in TikTok's parent company ByteDance, Snap, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Spotify, among others.\n\nNeedless to say, Laffont can typically spot the big tech trends before they happen, which is why investors are always so eager to get a glimpse into Coatue's portfolio each quarter. In the third quarter, Coatue trimmed its positions in CoreWeave(NASDAQ: CRWV), Tesla, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and invested in two recent initial public offerings.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPairing exposure to the artificial intelligence sector\n\nCoatue appeared to follow the broader institutional investor landscape in the quarter, reducing its stake in several prominent artificial intelligence (AI) companies. Coatue sold 62% of its position in the AI data center company CoreWeave, 15% of its position in the electric vehicle and robotaxi company Tesla, and 14% of its position in the AI chip giant Nvidia.\n\nIn recent months, investors have become increasingly concerned about AI valuations, which have long been high, as well as the macroeconomic environment, with investors penciling in a smaller chance of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December. Furthermore, other AI concerns have emerged, including the large amounts of money the hyperscalers are spending to build out AI infrastructure, which is expected to be in the trillions over the next five years.\n\nOther well-known investors like Michael Burry have been more outspoken on social media regarding concerns over how large AI companies like Oracle and Meta Platforms are accounting for depreciation of semiconductors and servers, specifically as they extend the useful life of them, despite uncertainty about how long they will really last.\n\nOther broader concerns that are coming into the spotlight are whether the U.S. can generate enough electricity to meet the demand for AI. Manufacturing AI chips also requires significant water usage, another issue related to the amount of resources needed to power AI.\n\nStory Continues\n\nUltimately, it's difficult to predict what will happen next in terms of whether this marks the beginning of a pullback or a buy-the-dip opportunity. I don't think AI is about to become irrelevant, but the sector's path is unclear. Investors should be long-term-focused, and in my view, try to avoid some of the higher valuations out there, such as Tesla's.\n\nRevealing positions in two IPOs\n\nOn its third-quarter 13F filing, Coatue reported positions in both the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company Klarna(NYSE: KLAR) and the collaborative design tech company Figma(NYSE: FIG), both of which were high-profile IPOs this year.\n\nFigma went public with tremendous hype, opening at $33 per share and rising to a high of $143 per share, although it would be short-lived. The company essentially provides a Google Docs-like workflow for designers and coders to collaborate on a range of projects, allowing multiple people to work on designs that can be easily translated into code for website or app implementation. The company also has AI components and is being integrated as a third party into ChatGPT.\n\nCoatue actually got involved in the company prior to the IPO, investing in it in 2024 at a $12.5 billion valuation. While selling the stock immediately following the IPO and the huge jump would have been a no-brainer, IPOs often contain lock-up provisions preventing this practice. At the end of the third quarter, Coatue held over 3.2 million shares.\n\nInvestors should still likely be wary of the stock, which has come down significantly after the initial IPO pop. Even at its current $18 billion market cap, Figma is still unprofitable and trades at over 17 times forward revenue.\n\nCoatue also reported owning 330,000 shares of Klarna at the end of the third quarter. I haven't found any evidence that Coatue ever participated in a private financing round of Klarna prior to this report, although it's certainly possible. However, it's also possible that Coatue recently scooped up shares. Klarna's IPO also started hot, but has since fallen below its IPO price.\n\nKlarna trades at a more reasonable valuation than Figma, at about 4 times forward revenue, but its losses have also risen significantly. BNPL companies are heavily impacted by the health of the consumer and the economy, so while the company has potential to disrupt the credit card space, I am still cautious on Klarna at this valuation.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Both indexes are still set for their \u200dbiggest monthly drops since March, with the Nasdaq still down over 6%.\n\nBesides the concerns around AI valuations that drove that selloff in the first place, optimism around a Fed cut doesn't change that October and November's payroll data -- key to rates expectations -- will only be released after the bank's December meeting.\n\nAnd policymakers are split on the path ahead. Boston Federal Reserve President Susan \u200bCollins said on Saturday she's still leaning against a December rate cut.\n\nU.S. markets will also have to digest retail sales, producer price and jobless claims data this week.\u200c\n\nThey looked subdued otherwise, with the dollar down 0.2% against a basket of currencies, while Treasury yields were largely steady after sizeable drops last week.\n\nIn a sign that risk sentiment remains fragile, Bitcoin dropping 2% to around $86,000, though it has bounced off Friday's low that had left it near the key $80,000 level below which losses may accelerate.\n\nMarkets remain on alert for intervention in the Yen by Japanese authorities, who tend to move in quiet periods with lower liquidity. The yen edged lower against the dollar on Monday, nearing last week's 10-month lows.\n\nThanksgiving could be an opportunity, but analysts are already questioning how effective a move might be.\n\nIn Europe, Ukraine peace talks remain front and centre after the U.\u2060S. and Ukraine agreed to modify an earlier proposal seen as too favourable to Moscow.\n\nEuropean defense stocks,\u200b while sitting on huge gains this year, continued to slide on Monday, dropping to their lowest since August.\u200b\n\nGeopolitics aside, the big focus is on Britain's much anticipated Wednesday budget, when finance minister Rachel Reeves will have to convince investors that she can deliver credible belt-tightening plans after U-turning on plans to raise income tax levels.\n\nBut there is some good fiscal news too. Italy saw its credit \u200drating upgrade from Moody's in 23 years on \u2060Friday.\n\nChart of the day\n\nU.S. equity markets have a long way to come back after last week, still sitting on heavy losses in November that have set them up for their worst monthly performance since March, when tariff worries rattled markets ahead of the big intra-month swing in April.\n\nToday's events to watch\n\n* Two-year U.\u2060S.

This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia\u2019s NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL,\u00a0Tesla\u2019s TSLA and Meta META.\n\nMag 7 Earnings Outlook Improves: A Closer Look\n\nNvidia\u2019s beat-and-raise quarterly results have eased the market\u2019s AI-centric worries for now, but the issue is unlikely to go away completely.\n\nThe chipmaker has been a big beneficiary of the ongoing AI-focused spending surge, as it is Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units that are running the datacenters. The stock has lost ground as the aforementioned worries took hold at the start of this month, but it is still up more than +35% this year, handily outperforming the broader market.\n\nThe broader Mag 7 group, of which Nvidia is a key member, has returned largely in-line with the broader market, up +13.7% vs. a gain of +14.1% for the S&P 500 index. The market doesn\u2019t appear to be equally worried about all AI players in the ongoing pullback, with\u00a0Alphabet continuing to get credit for its efforts even as Meta and some of the others get shunned.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +57.3% from the same period last year on +62.5% higher revenues, putting the company on track to more than double its full-year 2025 earnings from the year-earlier level. Earnings for next year are currently expected to be up +55%, followed by +26.7% growth in 2027.\n\nThis seemingly decelerating growth trend is solely a function of base effects, as demand trends for Nvidia\u2019s chips remain red hot over the next two years. Demand will eventually moderate as we move past the buildout phase of AI infrastructure, and the stock\u2019s recent weakness is likely a reflection of that.\n\nOne could argue that the stock\u2019s impressive gains over the last few years, that has pushed its market capitalization to over $4 trillion, have already factored in these expectations. But if estimates keep rising, as we are starting to see again following the beat-and-raise quarterly results, then Nvidia shareholders will legitimately expect the stock to sustain its positive trajectory.\n\nIncluding Nvidia, the Mag 7 group\u2019s Q3 earnings increased +28.3% from the same period last year on +18.1% higher revenues, which would follow the group\u2019s +26.4% earnings growth on +15.5% revenue growth.\n\nNot all members of the elite group are equally contributing to the growth pace, ranging from\u00a0Tesla\u2019s -39.5% earnings decline in Q3 to Nvidia\u2019s +57.3% jump and Alphabet\u2019s +33% growth pace.\n\nEstimates for the current period (2025 Q4) are going up, with the current earnings growth rate of +15.4% up from +14.3% a week back and +12.2% two weeks ago.\n\nThe group\u2019s 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +14.6%, followed by +16.8% in 2027.\n\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving.\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.7% weight in the index.\n\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all reports released through Friday, November 21st, we now have Q3 results from 473 S&P 500 members, or 94.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. The reporting cycle has come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with most of the remaining results from the Tech and Retail sectors.\n\nTotal earnings for these companies are up +15.6% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 83.4% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Retail sector, we now have Q3 results for 83.3% of the sector\u2019s members in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail companies are up +16.9% from the same period last year on +7.7% higher revenues, with 72% beating EPS estimates and 84% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nPlease note that the +15.2% earnings growth rate for Q3 represents the blended growth rate for the quarter, which combines the actual results for the 473 companies that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies.\n\nIn terms of S&P 500 index \u2018EPS,\u2019 these growth rates approximate to $261.68 for 2025 and $292.52 for 2026.\n\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here\u00a0>>>>Q3 Earnings Season: Retail Sector in Focus\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia\u2019s NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL,\u00a0Tesla\u2019s TSLA\u00a0and Meta META.\n\nMag 7 Earnings Outlook Improves: A Closer Look\n\nNvidia\u2019s beat-and-raise quarterly results have eased the market\u2019s AI-centric worries for now, but the issue is unlikely to go away completely.\n\nThe chipmaker has been a big beneficiary of the ongoing AI-focused spending surge, as it is Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units that are running the datacenters. The stock has lost ground as the aforementioned worries took hold at the start of this month, but it is still up more than +35% this year, handily outperforming the broader market.\n\nThe broader Mag 7 group, of which Nvidia is a key member, has returned largely in-line with the broader market, up +13.7% vs. a gain of +14.1% for the S&P 500 index. The market doesn\u2019t appear to be equally worried about all AI players in the ongoing pullback, with Alphabet continuing to get credit for its efforts even as Meta and some of the others get shunned.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +57.3% from the same period last year on +62.5% higher revenues, putting the company on track to more than double its full-year 2025 earnings from the year-earlier level. Earnings for next year are currently expected to be up +55%, followed by +26.7% growth in 2027.\n\nThis seemingly decelerating growth trend is solely a function of base effects, as demand trends for Nvidia\u2019s chips remain red hot over the next two years. Demand will eventually moderate as we move past the buildout phase of AI infrastructure, and the stock\u2019s recent weakness is likely a reflection of that.\n\nOne could argue that the stock\u2019s impressive gains over the last few years, that has pushed its market capitalization to over $4 trillion, have already factored in these expectations. But if estimates keep rising, as we are starting to see again following the beat-and-raise quarterly results, then Nvidia shareholders will legitimately expect the stock to sustain its positive trajectory.\n\nIncluding Nvidia, the Mag 7 group\u2019s Q3 earnings increased +28.3% from the same period last year on +18.1% higher revenues, which would follow the group\u2019s +26.4% earnings growth on +15.5% revenue growth.\n\nNot all members of the elite group are equally contributing to the growth pace, ranging from Tesla\u2019s -39.5% earnings decline in Q3 to Nvidia\u2019s +57.3% jump and Alphabet\u2019s +33% growth pace.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEstimates for the current period (2025 Q4) are going up, with the current earnings growth rate of +15.4% up from +14.3% a week back and +12.2% two weeks ago.\n\nThe group\u2019s 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +14.6%, followed by +16.8% in 2027.\n\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving.\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.7% weight in the index.\n\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all reports released through Friday, November 21st, we now have Q3 results from 473 S&P 500 members, or 94.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. The reporting cycle has come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with most of the remaining results from the Tech and Retail sectors.\n\nTotal earnings for these companies are up +15.6% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 83.4% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Retail sector, we now have Q3 results for 83.3% of the sector\u2019s members in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail companies are up +16.9% from the same period last year on +7.7% higher revenues, with 72% beating EPS estimates and 84% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nPlease note that the +15.2% earnings growth rate for Q3 represents the blended growth rate for the quarter, which combines the actual results for the 473 companies that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies.\n\nIn terms of S&P 500 index \u2018EPS,\u2019 these growth rates approximate to $261.68 for 2025 and $292.52 for 2026.\n\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here\u00a0>>>>Q3 Earnings Season: Retail Sector in Focus\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Now Waymo is gearing up to rapidly enter five new cities in the U.S. market.  Tesla hopes to remove its safety monitor and go full driverless by year-end.These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) shares have been on a wild ride in 2025 with investors engaged in a tug of war of sorts, between bears and bulls. The bears base their position in reality, a reality where Tesla sales and profits are in decline and its vehicle lineup is aging. The bulls base their position in a potentially lucrative future based around artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and robotaxis. Right now, the bulls are winning with Tesla stock up 28% over the past three months, but here's why investors might want to pump the brakes a bit.\n\nComing to a city near you\n\n\"Safe, routine, ready: Autonomous driving in new cities\" are the words that should have Tesla investors pumping the brakes on the potentially lucrative future they envisioned for the electric vehicle (EV) maker. That's because direct competitor Waymo is shifting its expansion into a higher gear: \"We've built a generalizable Driver, powered by Waymo's demonstrably safe AI, and an operational playbook to reliably achieve this milestone,\" said Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo's co-CEO, on the expansion, according to Electrek.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nThis week, Waymo announced fully autonomous driving in five new cities: Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando. Operations started in Miami this week and will begin in the remaining four cities in the coming weeks, although it's important to note that doors for riders won't open until next year. This goes with Waymo's recent playbook to test for a few months before opening the app to the public.\n\nPlaying catch up\n\nIt's also important for investors to grasp the lead that Waymo may have developed over the past few years. For instance, Tesla is currently testing its initial robotaxi operations in Austin, Texas, with roughly 30 robotaxis in operation and plans to expand the fleet to about 500 by the end of the year. Tesla is still using a safety monitor, which Waymo removed in 2020, but has plans to transition to fully driverless operation by the end of the year.\n\nTesla Cybercab. Image source: Tesla.\n\nThe five new cities that Waymo is entering will bring its total city count to 10 at a time when Tesla just announced it obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing service in Arizona. It's definitely a step forward for Tesla, although additional permits will be required before the automaker can operate a full robotaxi service in the state. When Tesla enters the Phoenix, Arizona market next year, it will already trail Waymo's operations in the city, which boasts at least 400 autonomous vehicles. In fact, Waymo said it has already surpassed 10 million driverless trips served to riders across its U.S. operations.\n\nDespite Tesla playing catch up to rival Waymo, Tesla investors have some reason to be optimistic. Tesla could very well develop a competitive advantage in scaling a robotaxi business thanks to access to a plethora of Tesla vehicles on the road and its production capacity. Furthermore, Tesla's strategic rollout could be more scalable as the company is relying on a camera-based system rather than LiDAR and radar, which competitors are using.\n\nWhat it all means\n\nTesla shareholders also made it clear where they want CEO Elon Musk's focus. Musk's new compensation package, worth up to $1 trillion, was approved by 75% of voters but with milestones tied to future endeavors. Musk will still have to build cars for some of his rewards, have 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation, 1 million Optimus robots, and 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions. These goals suggest the company is pivoting its core business from automotive manufacturer to a more tech-centric company.\n\nTesla's best days may very well be ahead of it. It's already proven many naysayers wrong by making it this far, but it's important for investors to pump the brakes on robotaxi hype, because not only is Tesla playing catch up to Waymo; the future of robotaxis is more uncertain thanks to evolving regulations, lawsuits, and safety concerns. Investors need to understand what company they're investing in moving forward, given Tesla's lofty valuation and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio approaching 300 times, and a market capitalization more than 10 times Ford and GM combined.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

You don't need to be as savvy as Buffett to have success in the stock market, because the right index fund can deliver spectacular long-term returns for patient investors. 10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett will retire from his role as CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway holding company at the end of 2025, where for the last 60 years he has overseen numerous wholly owned subsidiaries, in addition to a stock portfolio that's today worth $300 billion. Had you invested just $500 in Berkshire shares when he took the helm in 1965, it would be worth a staggering $24.8 million today.\n\nHowever, Buffett is a seasoned expert, and he knows the average investor would struggle to replicate his incredible ability to pick stocks. Therefore, he often recommends they buy a low-cost exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks a diversified index like the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) instead.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is one great option he has named in the past. Here's how it could turn a consistent investment of $500 per month into $1 million over the long term.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA great index fund for investors of all experience levels\n\nThe S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy. The index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning its largest constituents have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft are the world's most valuable companies, with a combined market capitalization of $11.9 trillion, and all three are in the information technology sector. Hence, this is the largest sector in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.\n\nHere are the top five sectors in the index, along with their weightings, and some of their most noteworthy stocks.\n\nSector Sector Weighting Noteworthy Stocks Information technology 35.06% Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple Financials 13.03% Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Communication services 10.32% Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix Consumer discretionary 10.05% Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's  Healthcare 9.75% Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie\n\nData source: Vanguard, State Street. Sector weightings are accurate as of Nov. 19, 2025, and are subject to change.\n\nThe other six sectors in the S&P 500 are industrials, consumer staples, energy, utilities, real estate, and materials, so the index is highly diversified.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, it's hard to ignore the significant influence of the information technology sector. The S&P 500 soared by 214% over the last 10 years, and the information technology sector was responsible for more than half of that overall gain, thanks to its own eye-popping return of 640%. In fact, if we exclude the sector entirely, the S&P's return over the last decade shrinks to just 79%.\n\nThis dynamic is likely to remain in place thanks to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, quantum computing, and more, which could fuel significant returns in stocks like Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the most cost-effective ways for investors to gain like-for-like exposure to the S&P 500. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. In dollar terms, an investment of $10,000 would incur an annual fee of just $3, whereas that fee could be as high as $74 in other funds, according to Vanguard.\n\nTurning $500 per month into $1 million\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered a compound annual return of 10.5% since its inception in 1957, and if it continues to grow at that pace, it could turn a consistent monthly investment of $500 into $1 million in under 30 years:\n\nMonthly Investment Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $500 $106,829 $409,298 $1,269,709\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nThe S&P has delivered an even better average annual return of 14.4% over the last five years, as themes like AI fueled incredible growth for some of the index's largest constituents, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and more. Just last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors that annual AI infrastructure spending could hit an eye-popping $4 trillion by 2030, so momentum in this space is unlikely to slow anytime soon.\n\nHowever, even though the S&P might continue generating accelerated returns over the next few years, it's also important to remember that volatility is a normal part of the investing journey. According to Capital Group, the index experiences a decline of 10% or more once every two and a half years, on average, and it slips into a bear market (a decline of 20% or more) every six years. These bumps in the road are the price of admission for an opportunity to earn life-changing returns over the long term.\n\nThe key to success is investing consistently, even during uncertain times. Warren Buffett is known for buying stocks in all market conditions, but especially during periods of weakness because as a value investor, he loves a bargain.\n\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

Historical headwinds, such as the astronomical price-to-sales ratios of quantum computing stocks, are front and center for investors.  However, the most significant risk for pure-play quantum computing stocks comes from a group of \"magnificent\" companies that are flush with cash and craving large addressable opportunities.10 stocks we like better than IonQ \u203a\n\nOver the last three years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the primary catalyst driving Wall Street's major stock indexes to record highs. But in 2025, it's taken a back seat to a technology that's produced truly jaw-dropping gains.\n\nOver the trailing year, as of the closing bell on Nov. 19, quantum computing pure-play stocksIonQ(NYSE: IONQ), Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT) have delivered respective returns of 90%, 1,860%, 1,530%, and 385%. For comparison, the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite has rallied 20% over the trailing year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nGains of this magnitude imply that investor hype surrounding quantum computing is tangible and may not fade anytime soon. While there are viable reasons to be excited about the real-world applications of Wall Street's hottest innovation, the biggest risk of all to this quartet of quantum computing stocks has gone virtually undetected by the investing populace.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did quantum computing stocks go parabolic in 2025?\n\nIn simple terms, quantum computing involves the use of specialized computers that can make rapid, simultaneous calculations at a considerably faster pace than the world's quickest supercomputers. Quantum computers are capable of tackling complex problems that classical computers are ill-equipped to handle.\n\nOne example of the real-world utility of quantum computers is their ability to speed up the real-time processing and learning capabilities of AI algorithms. Split-second decision-making is particularly important for AI software and systems.\n\nInvestors have also been enamored with the high ceiling for quantum computing hardware and services. Boston Consulting Group estimates this technology can add $450 billion to $850 billion to the global economy by 2040. Meanwhile, online publication The Quantum Insider is looking for this worldwide economic impact to reach the $1 trillion plateau by 2035.\n\nBut if there's one tangible factor that's really lit a fire under the shares of IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. in recent months, it's the prospect of brand-name collaborations.\n\nFor instance, \"Magnificent Seven\" members Amazon and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are both giving their respective quantum-cloud service subscribers access to IonQ's and Rigetti's quantum computers. Amazon's Braket and Microsoft's Azure Quantum can allow clients to run simulations and test their quantum computing hardware.\n\nAdditionally, quantum computing pure-play stocks soared following an Oct. 13 announcement from banking giant JPMorgan Chase that it plans to make direct equity and venture capital investments in 27 \"sub-areas.\" Quantum computing was one of these 27 investment targets identified by JPMorgan's initial research.\n\nAlthough everything would seem to be going swimmingly for quantum computing pure-play stocks, their parabolic ascent may prove fleeting.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis under-the-radar risk threatens to wipe out the first-mover advantage of pure-play stocks\n\nHistory tells us there are several reasons to be skeptical of the supercharged returns for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc.\n\nTo begin with, every hyped technology and game-changing innovation since the arrival of the internet in the mid-1990s has eventually navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly an innovation or trend would earn widespread adoption, gain utility, and/or be optimized. This eventually leads to lofty investor expectations not being met.\n\nQuantum computing is still in the very early stages of commercialization, which exposes it to a high risk of a bubble-bursting event.\n\nFurthermore, quantum computing stock valuations are otherworldly. Whereas price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 in market-leading businesses have historically alerted investors to potential stock market bubbles, the forward-year P/S ratios for IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. are many multiples above this historical mark.\n\nBut there's an even bigger risk to these four quantum computing stocks that virtually everyone is missing. Namely, some of their leading clients could become their top competitors in the years to come.\n\nWith the exception of electric-vehicle maker Tesla, whose operating cash flow has fluctuated in recent quarters, the other six members of the Magnificent Seven are flush with capital and generating more cash flow from their operating activities than they often know what to do with. When a game-changing innovation emerges with an eye-popping addressable market, companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)seize the opportunity.\n\nIn December 2024, Alphabet introduced the world to Willow, the company's latest quantum processing unit (QPU). Last month (October), Alphabet reported that Willow oversaw calculations that were approximately 13,000 times faster than the fastest classical supercomputers on the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, in February, Microsoft announced the arrival of Majorana 1, which is its take on a QPU. Microsoft claims that Majorana 1 is designed to scale to 1 million qubits, which is expected to significantly minimize errors while ensuring calculations that are considerably faster than those of classical computers.\n\nThe point being that we're already observing some of Wall Street's most influential, profitable, and cash-rich businesses encroaching on an industry where the first-mover advantage for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc. may be precarious, at best. Although IonQ recently completed a $2 billion equity offering, the funding situation for most pure-play quantum computing stocks remains uncertain. Trying to compete against the likes of Alphabet or Microsoft with no foundational operating segment and ongoing cash outflows is a recipe for disaster.\n\nWhile several headwinds exist for quantum computing pure-play stocks, internal competition from members of the Magnificent Seven represents the most significant risk to their success -- and perhaps even their survival.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

Image source: Tesla.\n\nGrowth is recovering\n\nAfter a sluggish first half of 2025, Tesla returned to double-digit revenue growth in Q3. Total revenue for the period reached $28.1 billion, a 12% increase year over year, driven by record vehicle deliveries and strong demand for large-scale energy storage projects. Automotive revenue rose 6% year over year to about $21.2 billion, while the energy generation and storage segment grew revenue 44% to roughly $3.4 billion as deployments reached 12.5 gigawatt-hours.\n\nThe company delivered more than 497,000 vehicles in the quarter.\n\nProfitability, however, told a different story. Third-quarter operating income fell 40% year over year to $1.6 billion, and operating margin dropped to 5.8% from 10.8% a year earlier. Operating expenses increased by 50% to approximately $3.4 billion, as the company invested heavily in artificial intelligence infrastructure and new product development.\n\nValuation and my buy price\n\nAs of this writing, the stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 270 and trades at about 14 times sales. Those are demanding multiples for a company that still earns most of its revenue from selling vehicles. And even if investors expect Tesla to look more like a high-margin software and services platform over time, today's valuation already prices this in.\n\nIn the meantime, Tesla's business remains capital-intensive. But management hopes high-margin businesses -- self-driving software sales and an autonomous ride-sharing network -- can help the company transform into a technology company with tech company-like margins. Then there's Tesla's plans for humanoid robots, but it's unclear what kind of margins it can achieve in such an unprecedented business.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe problem? Each of Tesla's growth initiatives will require significant sums of capital to scale. In addition, there's timing risk. These growth initiatives carry technical and regulatory risk that could delay commercialization.\n\nInvestors can already see the strain. Operating expenses in the third quarter rose much faster than revenue. That kind of spending is understandable for a company that believes it has an opportunity of unusual size. But does the stock's valuation leave enough room for the risks associated with building out these new product initiatives?\n\nAt a price that values Tesla well over 250 times current earnings and about 170 times forward earnings, even modest setbacks in autonomy timelines or vehicle demand could create sharp swings in the stock.\n\nThat is why my own discipline points to a lower entry point. I believe that at around $220 per share, the stock would still carry a valuation that reflects Tesla's position in electric vehicles and its growth opportunities in higher-margin businesses.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean investors should sell shares they already own. Extreme volatility is part of owning a stock with so much future potential baked in. So it's normal for shares to trade in a wide band. In addition, given Tesla's long history of incredible growth, the company could very well exceed even my most optimistic expectations.\n\nStill, I'm happy to admire the business from the sidelines and keep my buy price near $220, for now. This, of course, is a moving target that may very well move up over time as I get new information about Tesla's ever-expanding business. \r\n\r\nWhile there's no guarantee shares actually fall to this price, I'll be ready if they do.

Keeping that in mind, here is one industry titan whose competitive advantages creates flywheel effects and two whose momentum may slow.\n\nTwo Mega-Cap Stocks to Sell:\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.30 trillion\n\nOriginally founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle company accelerating the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\n\nWhy Should You Dump TSLA?\n\nTesla's scale advantage in EV production leads to gross margins that exceed incumbents such as General Motors and Ford. However, a softer macroeconomic backdrop and tariff pressures have weighed on automobile sales, which are highly cyclical. The company's execution ability is a question mark given its long history of delays, such as the Cybertruck and Robotaxi launches. Its sizeable investments in projects with uncertain return timelines, like Optimus, also raise skepticism from investors. On the bright side, Tesla's Megapack product solves a critical problem for utilities needing renewable energy storage solutions. This innovation has made the energy segment the most profitable and fastest-growing business line for the company.\n\nAt $393.83 per share, Tesla trades at 191.9x forward price-to-earnings.

The company broke records in its most recent quarter and the future still looks bright.10 stocks we like better than Lyft \u203a\n\nLyft(NASDAQ: LYFT) is a ride-sharing platform that competes with Uber. Anyone can choose to join the platform as a driver using their own vehicle. As people need rides, they log in to the Lyft app and arrange to be picked up.\n\nLyft had its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019, allowing investors to purchase shares -- ownership stakes -- in the company. But for those who want to own a small stake in this company, there are some important things to understand first.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?

See the stocks \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe big risk\n\nInnovation can disrupt existing business models. Consider Uber and Lyft. These two companies disrupted the traditional taxi model. When it comes to supply and demand, virtually all demand has shifted to these digital platforms, allowing these companies to capture the upside.\n\nInvestors fear that a new innovation will disrupt Lyft's business model. That innovation is autonomous vehicles. As Tesla and others push ahead with driverless technology, it seems inevitable that human drivers will be eliminated from the equation.\n\nIf driverless cars take over, it's possible that riders could still hail these vehicles from Lyft's platform. Lyft is also building a business to maintain autonomous vehicle fleets. But investors need to take time to assess whether this is a material risk to Lyft's business model over the long term -- and many believe it is.\n\nIf the risk is real, then it may be best to avoid Lyft stock altogether. After all, it's often a bad idea to invest in a dying way of doing things.\n\nThe upside\n\nLyft's business could still have a vibrant future -- for what it's worth, this is my view. If I'm right, there are some positive aspects of this business that could make Lyft stock a good buy today.\n\nConsider that Lyft has generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. That's good for a free-cash-flow margin of 16%. The margin is already quite strong, and it's still improving, which is a good sign for investors.\n\nBased on the stock's valuation, investors appear to be indifferent to Lyft's profitability. As of this writing, Lyft stock trades at less than 9 times its free cash flow. For perspective, Uber stock is trading at one of its cheapest valuations ever, and its valuation is still more than twice as expensive as Lyft's.\n\nLYFT Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts\n\nI believe Lyft stock can be a strong performer for one of two reasons. First, investors could come to appreciate the profits and increase its valuation. The stock could double and still not seem overvalued. Second, Lyft's valuation could stay the same, meaning its stock gains would be the same as its gains in profitability. For what it's worth, Lyft's free cash flow jumped 60% year over year in the most recent quarter.\n\nI find it unlikely that Lyft would get cheaper, considering it's so cheap already.\n\nLyft wouldn't be worthy of an investment today if it didn't have a future. But I believe it does. Key metrics such as riders, rides, and bookings all broke records in the most recent quarter, suggesting that this is a business with a strong customer base that can keep carrying it higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lyft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lyft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lyft wasn\u2019t one of them.

It's a forward-looking fund that seeks to capitalize on emerging opportunities.\n\nIt isn't an overly diverse fund, nor is it a terribly cheap one -- its expense ratio of 0.75% is on the high side. In exchange for its carefully selected stocks, you'll have to pay a bit more in fees for this ETF than you would for many other funds.\n\nCurrently, its top five holdings are Tesla (12.2%), Teradyne (9.4%), Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (7.3%), Palantir Technologies (6.2%), and Advanced Micro Devices (5.2%). North American companies account for the lion's share of the fund's holdings at 91%. And the median market cap is $38 billion.\n\nWhy the ARK fund has been doing so well this year\n\nAs of market close on Nov. 17, the ETF's returns for 2025 were an impressive 36%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by just 13%. The reason for the fund's success is not surprising when you consider how well some of its top holdings have performed. These are the year-to-date performances of the five largest positions it has (as of Nov. 17):\n\nKratos: 166%Palantir: 126%Advanced Micro Devices: 99%Teradyne: 33%Tesla: 1%\n\nTesla is its largest holding, but it hasn't been doing terribly well this year. Instead, stocks such as Kratos and Palantir, which benefit from an increase in government spending on defense, have more than doubled in value.\n\nWhen a fund's top holdings are doing so well, that can have a significant impact on how the ETF does. In the case of this ARK fund, Kratos and Palantir account for more than 13% of its holdings. And if you include Advanced Micro Devices, that means about 19% of the stocks it's holding have roughly doubled (or done better) this year.\n\nIs this ETF still a good investment?\n\nThe ARK ETF is on track to generate a return of more than 30% for a third consecutive year. With the market being bullish on artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics, the fund has thrived and been a popular option for growth investors. The danger is that with valuations being high in tech these days, there is some vulnerability here.\n\nIn 2022, when the market crashed, tech stocks suffered significant declines. That year, the S&P 500 fell by 19%, but this ARK fund crashed an incredible 47%. It's a risk that you need to be aware of and comfortable with, knowing that in a downturn or widespread tech sell-off, there could be some significant losses, particularly since the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF isn't overly diversified.\n\nGiven how hot it has been over the past few years and how high valuations are for stocks, I would hold off on investing in the fund today. The ETF recently hit an all-time high, and in recent weeks, it's been sliding lower amid broader weakness in tech. Unless you're willing to take on the risk and are planning to hold the fund for several years, you may want to take a wait-and-see approach.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ark ETF Trust - Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ark ETF Trust - Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ark ETF Trust - Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

So really, $1M in retirement is gonna get you that fairly safely. $1.5M isn\u2019t exactly overkill.\u201d\n\nSeveral echoed that sentiment, emphasizing that she may be over-saving. One user said: \u201cThe advice I\u2019ve been following is to save between 20-25% of your income for retirement. Certainly understand the financial advisor's point of wanting to make sure you're enjoying life now.\u201d\n\nStill, many pushed back on her view that she doesn't want to own a home due to rising property taxes in retirement. \u201cYou'll have increasing rent,\u201d one commenter pointed out, while another said that rent will increase much faster than property taxes.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOthers said owning a home can be part of a long-term retirement plan. \u201cIf OP takes out a 30-year mortgage right now and only follows the payment schedule, she would be basically paid off by retirement,\u201d one person said.\n\nSee Also: Bill Gates Says Climate Change \u2018Needs to Be Solved' \u2014 This Award-Winning Building Material Is Tackling It Head-On\n\nMore broadly, the thread turned into a discussion on quality of life and balance. \u201cDon\u2019t put off absolutely everything,\u201d one commenter warned, sharing her breast cancer diagnosis at 44 and regrets about not spending more earlier. Another wrote, \u201cYou could say you want to save to travel when you retire, but odds are you can do more things while traveling now than when you are in your late 60s.\u201d\n\nStill, not everyone was ready to abandon the aggressive savings path. \u201cNobody ever wanted less money in retirement,\u201d one person said. Another wrote, \u201cThe earlier you start saving for retirement, the easier it will be to actually retire, due to compounding growth.\u201d\n\nSome found a middle ground, advising her to reallocate a small portion of her retirement contributions into a taxable brokerage account. \u201cMaybe just budget in an extra trip every year?\u201d one commenter suggested. \u201cI think you're doing great!\u201d\n\nIn the end, the advice she received from Reddit was that if she\u2019s comfortable with her lifestyle now, there's no harm in continuing what she's doing. But if she wants to travel more or increase day-to-day enjoyment, a slight rebalancing of her savings goals wouldn\u2019t hurt.\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook is likely to retain his position until at least mid-2026, a claim that contradicts earlier reports.\n\nWhat Happened: The Financial Times had earlier reported this month that Apple was gearing up for Cook\u2019s departure\u00a0\u201cas soon as next year.\u201d\n\nThis report had triggered speculations about a potential leadership transition ahead of Apple\u2019s annual events.\n\nHowever,\u00a0Gurman, \u00a0in his\u00a0latest\u00a0\"Power On\u201d report, refuted this claim. Gurman expressed that\u00a0he would be \u201cshocked\u201d if\u00a0Cook were to step\u00a0down between late January and\u00a0June next year.\n\n\u201cBased on everything I've learned in recent weeks, I don't believe a departure by the middle of next year is likely. In fact, I would be shocked if Cook steps down in the time frame outlined by the FT,\u201d Gurman wrote.\n\n\u201cSome people have speculated that the story was a \"test balloon\" orchestrated by Apple or someone close to Cook to prepare Wall Street for a change, but that isn't the case either. I believe the story was simply false,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cTim Cook won't be CEO forever, but a report on his imminent departure was premature.\u00a0Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook turned 65 this month and is one of the longest-tenured CEOs in Silicon Valley. There will be a day when the company announces a CEO transition, and we're far closer to the end of Cook's tenure than we are from the beginning,\u201d he further shared.\n\nAlso Read: Apple Announces Major Changes: New iPhone Models and Altered Release Schedule\n\nGurman also noted that there\u00a0have been \u201cfew signs internally\u201d\u00a0that Cook is planning to step down. He further mentioned that John Ternus,\n\nApple\u2019s Senior Vice President of\u00a0Hardware Engineering, is considered as the most likely successor to Cook whenever the transition occurs.\n\nWhy It Matters: The speculation about Cook\u2019s departure had raised concerns about the future leadership of Apple, a company that has seen tremendous growth under Cook\u2019s stewardship.\n\nGurman\u2019s prediction, if accurate, would mean that Cook will continue to guide Apple\u2019s strategic direction for the next few years, potentially leading to further growth and innovation.\n\nThe mention of John Ternus as a potential successor also provides some insight into Apple\u2019s succession planning, which is crucial for the company\u2019s long-term stability and success.\n\nRead Next\n\nApple's Satellite-Powered Features for iPhones: A Journey Spanning Over A Decade\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

That reaction is usually blamed on tight budgets, but new research shows even households earning $200,000 a year are dodging their banking apps because the numbers on the screen feel stressful, not soothing.\n\nAccording to new research from The Harris Poll, 40% of six-figure earners say they have avoided checking their account balance to reduce stress, and that share jumps to 42% among those earning $200,000 or more. Nearly half of people in this group also say they struggle with financial anxiety, and a majority feel guilty complaining about money at all because they know they earn more than most.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse \u2014 Just $0.86 a Share Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate\u2014Get Institutional Access Yourself\n\nThe \"Income Paradox Survey\" was run online in the U.S. between July 31 and Aug. 2. It captured 2,109 adults nationwide, including 728 people with personal incomes of at least $100,000 and 280 who earn $200,000 or more, roughly the top 10% of individual income earners. So the people saying they are stressed are not the outliers at the very bottom of the six-figure pack.\n\nThe top-line numbers explain why opening a banking app has turned into a jump scare. Six figures now looks more like survival than success. Harris finds 64% of six-figure earners agree that six figures is \"survival mode, not a sign of wealth,\" and 52% say that even at this level, the American Dream is not possible for them. About 1 in 3 describe themselves as financially distressed, meaning they feel stretched, struggling or drowning with their finances.\n\nThe money is not being blown on designer handbags or mansions. It is going to the same categories that challenge everyone else, just with bigger price tags. When Harris asked what is draining income the most right now, six-figure earners pointed first to grocery and household essentials at 36%, followed by rent or mortgage payments at 32%, and health insurance or medical costs at 31%. Unexpected emergencies and transportation costs round out the top five, both at around 30%.\n\nTrending: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nThose basics leave little room for comfort spending. More than half of six-figure earners say things like regular vacations, driving a new car, or dining out regularly fall into a financial \"pressure zone\" where they either stretch to cover the cost or actively avoid it to stay stable. It is a quiet reset of what used to count as middle-class life.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nTo bridge the gap, many high earners lean on workarounds that used to be associated with people making far less. Three-quarters of six-figure earners have put everyday bills on a credit card in the past three months because they ran out of cash, not to chase rewards. That rises to 80% among those earning $200,000 or more. Nearly half of the $200,000 group say they rely on credit cards to make ends meet, and 45% say buy now, pay later has become a regular part of how they spend their money.\n\nThe coping strategies go beyond plastic. Among six-figure earners, 61% are either already working a side hustle or planning to, and sizable shares report selling personal items, cutting back on medical care, or even skipping meals to keep up with expenses. In the same survey, 62% say it feels nearly impossible to keep up with expenses on one income.\n\nRising prices have not helped. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that consumer prices have climbed roughly 23% since 2019, which means a paycheck that once covered a comfortable lifestyle now has to stretch much farther just to stand still. For households whose costs are concentrated in housing, healthcare, childcare and debt, those inflation years are still echoing.\n\nSee Also: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\n\nThat leads to the real question: how much would it take for these high earners to finally feel secure instead of stressed every time they glance at a balance.\n\nHarris asked that directly. Half of six-figure earners say a household needs at least $200,000 a year to feel comfortably middle class where they live. Among those already earning $200,000 or more, 75% say the same. Even more striking, 53% of six-figure earners say they would not feel financially secure unless they earned double what they make now, a view that is shared by 53% of the $200,000 group and 55% of all Americans.\n\nIn other words, plenty of people already earning $200,000 think they would only breathe easy closer to $400,000. Six-figure salaries were once the finish line. In this survey they look more like mile markers on a moving track, where even the people near the front are still glancing over their shoulders, hoping the next notification is not another bill.\n\nFor anyone in that camp, talking with a financial advisor can take some of the drama out of those numbers. A good advisor can help high earners sort out where the money is actually going, build a plan for debt, saving and investing, and pressure-test what \"secure\" really looks like for their household. It won't fix rising prices or rewrite a paycheck, but it can turn vague dread into a clearer map, which is often the first step toward feeling less anxious every time the banking app lights up.\n\nRead Next: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets \u2014 Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

She has also embraced Bitcoin and crypto platforms as a parallel financial system.\n\nSo far in 2025, her flagship ARK Innovation ETF is up nearly 55%\u201360% year-to-date, compared to nearly 13% for the S&P 500 on a total-return basis.\n\nIn other words, Wood\u2019s flagship fund is outperforming the broad market by over 4x this year.\n\nCoreWeave becomes latest AI battleground\n\nNow, the ARK Invest boss is buying the dip in CoreWeave.\n\nShe scooped up 350,734 shares, spending nearly $24 million as the stock slid almost 30% over the past few trading sessions.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood buys $16.2 million of sinking AI stock\n\nImportantly, this isn\u2019t her only bold swing in AI.\n\nShe\u2019s tiptoed back into Nvidia, adding more shares for the first time since August. She scooped up 93,374 shares of the chip giant ($17 million worth). Though it\u2019s not a massive position, it\u2019s a clear re-entry into the name that defines the AI trade.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nOverall, Wood remains a fan of AI, boldly stating on CNBC in October that while there could be corrections, there's still more opportunity:\n\nMeanwhile, CoreWeave\u2019s earnings tested investors\u2019 patience.\n\nCoreWeave\u2019s earnings and guidance cut\n\nBlowout quarter, still in the red:Q3 sales were up $1.36 billion, more than double a year ago, while net losses narrowed to $0.22 per share, versus $1.82 a year earlier. Guidance shaved: Management slashed 2025 revenue guidance to $5.05\u2013$5.15 billion, down from $5.15\u2013$5.35 billion, trailing behind Wall Street\u2019s $5.29 billion consensus. It\u2019s a timing headache, not a demand problem: The downgrade is apparently due to a delay at a single third-party data center developer (reportedly CoreScientific), pushing some GPU capacity and sales from Q4 2025 into early 2026. Meanwhile, the sales backlog skyrocketed to $55.6 billion, representing an 85% quarter-over-quarter increase.\n\nInside the AI \u201cpower grid\u201d Nvidia helped build\n\nCoreWeave rents out Nvidia-powered data centers to hyperscalers and other tech businesses for building AI models. So, it\u2019s essentially renting out GPU muscle to companies that avoid the costs of running their own hardware.\n\nSo it\u2019s basically a power grid for AI, where companies can simply plug in and pay for their usage.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s a cloud \u201cfactory floor\u201d where CoreWeave provides the heavy machinery (GPUs, networking, infrastructure), while its clients bring their blueprints (models) and data.\n\nRelated: Legendary billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel makes huge bet on major tech stock\n\nFor more color, Nvidia\u2019s latest filing shows that it\u2019s currently holding 24.28 million CoreWeave shares, which is nearly $3.3 billion in value (86% of its disclosed stock portfolio).\n\nThat stake is roughly 6% of CoreWeave\u2019s total share count, stemming from Nvidia\u2019s early $100 million investment.\n\nAdditionally, the two AI behemoths also have a $6.3 billion \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d cloud-capacity deal that runs through 2032.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang even pointed out publicly that their CoreWeave stake is the kind of \u201cgreat startup\u201d the tech giant backs within its AI infrastructure ecosystem.\n\nBullish is Wood\u2019s high-conviction crypto swing\n\nWood didn\u2019t stop at CoreWeave. She widened bets across crypto and biotech, too.\n\nARK added 49,900 shares of Bullish, a popular public crypto exchange that owns CoinDesk. Also, it has been one of 2025\u2019s flashiest debuts, with a massive $1.1 billion IPO and a $5.4 billion valuation.\n\nWood paired that with 31,890 shares of BitMine and 20,700 shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, even as Bitcoin dipped below $85,000, its weakest level since April.\n\nAlso, ARK bought 67,078 shares of CRISPR Therapeutics, a $3.3 million nod to her long-standing belief in gene editing being the next chapter in medicine.\n\nThe biggest IPOs of 2025 so far\n\nHere\u2019s a look at where Bullish sits in this year\u2019s monster debuts:\n\nCoreWeave: The Nvidia-backed AI player raised $1.5 billion at a roughly $23 billion valuation. Figma: Design-software powerhouse pulled in nearly $1.2 billion, with its valuation at $19 billion at the time of pricing. Circle: USDC\u2019s issuer finally hit the market, raising nearly $1.05 billion while landing an $8 billion valuation. Bullish: The CoinDesk-owning crypto exchange raised $1.1 billion at a $5.4 billion valuation.\n\nWood hits the brakes on a few high flyers\n\nAfter loading up on AI and crypto names, Wood rebalanced with a round of trims.\n\nARK\u2019s November 21 trims\n\nGitLab (GTLB): Sold 670,144 shares ($28.49 million). Exact Sciences (EXAS): Sold 227,153 shares ($22.87 million) after Abbott acquired it for $21 billion. Iridium (IRDM): Sold 169,485 shares ($2.68 million).

Recent earnings results showed robust trading activity across its different products. The company is expanding its offerings, including its rapidly growing prediction markets product. 10 stocks we like better than Robinhood Markets \u203a\n\nEveryone hopes to uncover the next Nvidia or Tesla, a stock that skyrockets and turns early investors into millionaires. It's tempting to see these stellar returns and imagine the wealth you could have built if you'd bought those stocks early.\n\nRobinhood(NASDAQ: HOOD) may be one of those stocks for some investors. About two years ago, the stock traded around $8 per share, and today it's trading at $115 per share. In other words, a $10,000 investment would be worth $143,750 today.\n\nBut that's the past. Could investing in Robinhood today be the ticket to setting you up for life? Let's dive into the business and explore the potential Robinhood offers investors today.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRobinhood's evolution\n\nRobinhood has experienced an impressive turnaround in the past several years. A few years ago, the company struggled with the meme-stock frenzy and the regulatory scrutiny that followed. Customers were unhappy, and regulators threatened its payment for order flow business model, which could have taken down its primary revenue source.\n\nSince then, Robinhood has transformed its business. The company has attracted significant capital to its platform by using elevated interest rates to encourage customers to bring funds to the platform. This strategy has proven to be quite effective. Since the start of 2024, Robinhood's total platform assets have grown from $102 billion to $343 billion as of the end of October.\n\nA key aspect of Robinhood's growth is its Gold membership account. Customers can pay $5 per month or $50 per year to earn higher interest rates and other benefits. This subscription service provides Robinhood with a steady stream of income. Additionally, users who subscribe to Robinhood Gold have more assets and engage with the platform more frequently than non-subscribers.\n\nRecent earnings results saw solid growth\n\nRobinhood's recent quarterly results were solid, with revenue of $1.27 billion and earnings per share of $0.61, both slightly ahead of consensus estimates. Its quarterly results were helped by solid transaction revenue growth along with an increase in net interest income.\n\nTransaction-based revenue surged 129% to $730 million, driven by growth in cryptocurrency (up 300%), options (50%), and equities (132%). Meanwhile, its average revenue per user (ARPU) rose 82% to $191, while net interest revenue increased 66% to $456 million.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHOOD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nWhat's next for Robinhood\n\nRobinhood continues to roll out new offerings, too. For example, successfully monetizing its prediction markets product could be a powerful new revenue source for the company. Its prediction markets business surpassed $100 million in annualized revenue in less than a year. Using October volume, analysts at Bernstein noted that this business is tracking toward a $300 million run rate.\n\nCEO Vlad Tenev noted that Robinhood Prediction Markets had traded 4 billion event contracts all-time, with over 2 billion in the third quarter alone. The company aims to expand its prediction markets product into countries outside the U.S., engaging with overseas regulators such as the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nRobinhood is also looking to expand its addressable market by offering retail investors access to asset classes that have traditionally been reserved for institutions. The company announced the filing of an initial registration statement for Robinhood Ventures Fund I, a closed-end fund. This vehicle aims to provide retail investors with exposure to private companies. It is also planning to create a route for amateur investors to invest in private AI companies.\n\nCould buying Robinhood set you up for life?\n\nRelying on any single stock to set you up for life is a tall task. You would need staggering returns or a hefty initial investment in a single stock for this to happen. For example, if you buy $10,000 in Robinhood stock today, you would need it to grow at a nearly 26% compound annual growth rate for the next 20 years to get to $1 million.\n\nRobinhood has done an excellent job growing its business after heightened scrutiny a few years ago. The company continues to expand into new markets, and I'm optimistic about what the future holds for Robinhood. The stock isn't cheap, priced at 47 times this year's projected earnings per share, reflecting the optimistic growth projections investors have today.\n\nThat said, I like Robinhood and think it has solid growth potential. While you don't want to rely on any single investment to build wealth, I like Robinhood stock as a small piece of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nShould you buy stock in Robinhood Markets right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Robinhood Markets, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Robinhood Markets wasn\u2019t one of them.

BYD is also currently the global EV leader, and likely to hold on to this lead indefinitely. Competition has put pressure on the EV outfit's profit margins. 10 stocks we like better than BYD Company \u203a\n\nIt isn't a household name... not here in America anyway. That's largely because it doesn't sell its product in the United States (at least not yet). If you've stumbled across BYD Company(OTC: BYDDY), however, you probably liked what you saw -- like its profitability -- enough to consider taking on a position in China's electric vehicle giant. And understandably so.\n\nBefore you make or build on such an investment, though, you'll want to understand the three biggest factors driving this stock's price right now. These factors are likely to continue driving this ticker's price for the foreseeable future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. The company is fiercely self-sufficient\n\nMaking automobiles can be incredibly complicated. Aside from sourcing thousands of different parts from all over the world, they must be assembled in one place, and then delivered to where they're sold. It's just a lot to manage when you're outsourcing much of this production and service.\n\nBYD takes the even more complicated approach to being in the carmaking business, though. Rather than punting much of its manufacturing work to third-party partners, it does the bulk of this work itself. Unlike many of its nascent competitors, it also manufactures its own lithium-ion batteries used in almost all modern electric vehicles. BYD even owns seven massive boats used to transport electric vehicles from China to overseas markets, rather than relying on contracted maritime delivery services.\n\nAll these decisions incur significant up-front costs. In the long run, however, they provide BYD with the flexibility and nimbleness more companies wish they enjoyed. (The next detail about BYD says as much.)\n\n2. BYD technically already dominates the EV market\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) may still be the best-known name in the business, but it's no longer the biggest. In terms of total unit sales, BYD technically eclipsed Tesla earlier this year, and on a worldwide basis has now outsold Tesla for four consecutive quarters.\n\nGiven its capacity to make and deliver electric cars exactly how, when, and where needed, it's reasonable to presume the company will continue widening its lead on its top rival as well as all other competitors.\n\n3. Like Tesla, competition is crimping BYD's profit margins\n\nBeing bigger doesn't necessarily mean this company can simply push its rivals around indefinitely, however. BYD's share of the electric vehicle market in China -- where the company still does most of its business, and where most EVs are sold -- slipped from 36.1% in October of last year to only 23.1% last month, with share going to newer entrants like Geely, SAIC, and even Xiaomi.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis fresh competition has forced BYD to discount its cars too, dragging its recently reported third-quarter profit down 33% from its year-ago comparison. Although financial analyst EY (formerly Ernst & Young) expects electrified automobiles' share of China's passenger car market to grow from 50% to 90% of the country's total automobile market by 2034, those price-competitive rivals will still be around then, keeping pressure on BYD's profit margins in place the whole time. The company will eventually need to respond.\n\nShould you buy stock in BYD Company right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in BYD Company, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and BYD Company wasn\u2019t one of them.

In particular, a small collective known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- comprised of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- are among the most closely held stocks across the entire S&P 500.\n\nOne notable investor who stayed on the sidelines throughout the AI revolution, however, is Warren Buffett. Over the last few years, Buffett's investment conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, was stockpiling record levels of cash while everyone else raced to buy more technology stocks.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nBRK.B Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThese dynamics are beginning to shift. According to Berkshire's latest 13F filing, the investment firm bought 17.8 million shares of Alphabet during the third quarter -- a stake that is now worth about $4.3 billion. Notably, Alphabet was the only stock Berkshire purchased in the third quarter.\n\nLet's break down Buffett's investment philosophy and explore how Alphabet fits into that equation. From there, I'll take a look at Alphabet's valuation metrics to help determine if now is a good time to follow Buffett's lead.\n\nWhat types of stocks does Warren Buffett like to buy?\n\nIf you want to learn how to invest like Warren Buffett, you're in luck. While the Oracle of Omaha ranks among the world's wealthiest people, Buffett's approach to investing is quite simple.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio does not feature speculative companies involved in volatile industries. Instead, Buffett seeks out durability. Against this backdrop, it's not surprising that companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Chevron are some of Buffett's largest positions.\n\nEach of these is considered a blue chip company that produces steady, predictable cash flow. Moreover, these businesses often reinvest their profits into shareholder rewards programs such as dividends or stock buybacks.\n\nIn essence, Buffett pounces on businesses with best-in-class brand recognition that sell products that people need in their daily lives. Given these dynamics, many of the positions in Berkshire's portfolio could be seen as stocks that long-term investors can own forever.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAlphabet meets Buffett's checklist\n\nAlphabet checks off many of Buffett's boxes. The company owns two of the most recognizable brands on the planet: internet search platform Google and video-sharing website YouTube.\n\nGiven the level of internet surface area that Alphabet covers, it's obvious why advertisers are eager to capitalize on the engagement the company generates. This gives Alphabet enormous leverage in the form of pricing power, which directly translates into a steady, highly profitable operation.\n\nBeyond advertising, Alphabet has also built a thriving cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Underneath this umbrella sits a custom hardware offering, called tensor processing units (TPUs). Layering cloud software with custom silicon gives Alphabet a direct line into the semiconductor industry -- enabling it to take on incumbents like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nLastly, Alphabet also has a large consumer electronics business in Android -- which competes with Apple -- and is also taking on Tesla in the world of autonomous driving through its subsidiary, Waymo.\n\nAlphabet's diverse ecosystem provides the company with an enviable degree of flexibility -- a form of malleability that positions it to pivot and grow during virtually any economic cycle or emerging technology trend. In turn, the company is consistently profitable, which Alphabet uses to reinvest in innovation as well as reward shareholders through a modest dividend program.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA Buffett masterclass: Finding value in a sea of growth\n\nIn my view, it's unlikely that Buffett decided to initiate a position in Alphabet purely based on the AI narrative. Berkshire's portfolio has always featured a limited number of technology businesses.\n\nHowever, among the tech stocks that Buffett has chosen, a common theme arises. In addition to Apple, Berkshire also has positions in Amazon and now Alphabet. Each of these companies has built diversified ecosystems across software, hardware, and consumer services.\n\nGOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28, Alphabet stock is no longer trading at a bargain. While paying a premium is uncharacteristic of Buffett, Alphabet is still the second-cheapest stock among the Magnificent Seven -- suggesting investors may not be fully pricing in the company's next growth phase.\n\nIn my eyes, Buffett is still sticking to his playbook -- identifying relative value in an otherwise frothy market. Furthermore, I think the timing of Berkshire's purchase of Alphabet stock is telling. In other words, if Buffett and his constituents felt that AI was a fad or a bubble, then Berkshire would not have bought Alphabet stock.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, I think Alphabet remains an attractive opportunity given its proven durability and compelling long-term potential -- with or without AI playing a role in the thesis.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

While paying a premium is uncharacteristic of Buffett, Alphabet is still the second-cheapest stock among the Magnificent Seven -- suggesting investors may not be fully pricing in the company's next growth phase.\n\nIn my eyes, Buffett is still sticking to his playbook -- identifying relative value in an otherwise frothy market. Furthermore, I think the timing of Berkshire's purchase of Alphabet stock is telling. In other words, if Buffett and his constituents felt that AI was a fad or a bubble, then Berkshire would not have bought Alphabet stock.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, I think Alphabet remains an attractive opportunity given its proven durability and compelling long-term potential -- with or without AI playing a role in the thesis.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

New Survey Finds Cash Is 'Cringe' And Leads To Frivolous Spending Among Gen Z", "content": "Parents today are navigating a financial world that looks nothing like the one they grew up with. And for many families, one question keeps coming up: When is the right time to give your teen a debit card?\n\nWith digital payments now the norm for young people, new research suggests that teens may actually learn better habits with a card in hand. But it also highlights some surprising tendencies around cash, spending, and savings that families may want to consider.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon \u2014 Invest at $0.86/Share An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace\u2014Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nGen Z Says Cash Encourages Overspending\n\nThere is a clear generational shift in attitudes toward physical money, according to Cash App's Gen-Z Financial Future survey. More than half of Gen Z respondents said they're more likely to spend impulsively when they have cash, and nearly a third see cash users as \"out of touch\" or even \"cringe.\" At the same time, 53% reported using cash only as a last resort.\n\nThese attitudes may be shaping how young people manage their money. Many Gen Z consumers are already using checking or savings accounts, but the survey found that savings levels remain low: about 46% reported having less than $500 saved. Limited awareness of interest rates may also be contributing \u2014 only 44% knew the rate on their savings account.\n\nWhy More Teens Are Using Debit Cards\n\nDebit cards are becoming a common tool for teens to build financial skills. Most major banks allow teens as young as 13 to open checking accounts with a parent or guardian as a co-signer, according to Bankrate. Parents often see debit cards as a controlled way to help their children practice budgeting while still maintaining oversight.\n\nTrending: Have $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone \u2014 don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nThe Cash App survey reinforces that idea. Parents of teens ages 13\u201317 reported that giving their teens access to a debit card or savings account has:\n\nIncreased their financial independence Encouraged more responsible spending Helped them build budgeting confidence\n\nThis suggests that early hands-on experience may help teens develop better long-term habits, especially when combined with parental guidance.\n\nTeens Want Tools That Reward Good Habits\n\nAnother major finding from the survey is that earning interest is a powerful motivator. Over three-quarters of Gen Z respondents said they'd save more if they were earning interest. In response, Cash App recently expanded its 3.5% APY savings feature to Sponsored Accounts for teens ages 13\u201317.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe survey also shows that teens aren't just saving for short-term purchases. About 46% are building funds for emergencies, 36% are preparing for major milestones like college or moving out, and 37% are saving for experiences like travel.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate\u2014Get Institutional Access Yourself\n\nSigns Your Teen May Be Ready\n\nWhile readiness varies by child, financial experts at Bankrate say parents should consider a few common indicators before setting up a debit card for their children:\n\nThey're earning money. A first job or side gig is often a natural time to start managing income. They're driving. A debit card can help teens cover gas or handle emergencies. They frequently ask for money. A debit card tied to an allowance or stipend can help them practice budgeting.\n\nBankrate also says that parental involvement \u2014 such as setting rules, reviewing transactions, and holding regular \"money check-ins\" \u2014 plays a big role in whether teens use debit cards responsibly.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDebit cards are increasingly becoming part of the financial learning curve for teens. The data suggests that Gen Z sees digital money as the norm, while cash may actually encourage more spontaneous spending.\n\nWith the right guardrails and ongoing conversations, a debit card can be a practical way to help teens build confidence, understand budgeting, and establish healthy money habits before adulthood.\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

The airline is also adjusting its global route networks while monitoring tariff developments that could increase costs and slow fleet expansion. For now, investors should expect continued volatility as Delta balances these competing forces.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla?

Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with $100.\n\nCurrent DAL Stock Overview\n\nMarket Cap: 37.07 billion dollars Trailing P/E: 8.30 Forward P/E: 7.87 1-Year Return: \u20130.22 percent YTD Return: \u20136 percent\n\nAccording to Benzinga, Delta is a consensus Buy, with analysts assigning an average price target of 68.69 dollars. The highest target stands at 90 dollars, and the lowest at 39 dollars. The most recent price targets \u2014 from BofA Securities, Raymond James and UBS \u2014 average 73 dollars, reflecting almost 28 percent upside.\n\nQuick Snapshot Table of Predictions\n\nYear Bullish Average Bearish 2025 58.75 55.68 52.04 2026 66.72 52.28 41.19 2027 71.62 56.64 45.81 2028 96.86 71.52 54.71 2029 101.16 80.59 53.8 2030 95.38 74.62 58.81 2031 102.4 81.01 65.43 2032 138.56 102.49 78.18 2033 144.71 115.25 76.88 2040 283.42 210.56 159.91 2050 570.77 444.94 351.92\n\nThese projections are based on CoinCodex modeling using historical price action, trend analysis and long-horizon moving averages.\n\nBull & Bear Case\n\nBull Case\n\nDelta's premium travel segment remains one of the strongest in the industry, supported by demand for business-class cabins and steady economic strength among higher-income travelers. Its SkyMiles loyalty program \u2014 and its partnership with American Express \u2014 delivers some of the highest-margin recurring revenue in the airline sector, offering stability even when ticket revenue fluctuates.\n\nThe carrier also benefits from effective fuel-cost management, improved labor agreements and growing international travel demand. As global route networks normalize and fleet utilization improves, Delta is positioned to generate stronger cash flow. Ongoing investment in aircraft efficiency, digital upgrades and sustainability initiatives further supports long-term competitiveness.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBear Case\n\nDelta faces rising uncertainty from tariff increases on imported aircraft and parts. These added costs could significantly raise capital expenditures, strain margins and delay fleet modernization. Continued trade tensions also introduce risk around international demand and cross-border route economics.\n\nFuel price volatility and new labor contracts across pilots and cabin crew threaten cost stability. Slower global growth or recessionary conditions could weaken discretionary travel demand, reducing premium ticket revenue. Meanwhile, aggressive competition from both U.S. carriers and international airlines poses ongoing pricing and yield pressure.\n\nDAL Stock Price Prediction for 2025\n\nBullish: 58.75 Average: 55.68 Bearish: 52.04\n\nAccording to CoinCodex, 2025 is expected to bring modest movement within a stable channel as Delta contends with labor-cost inflation and the lingering effects of geopolitical tensions.\n\nDAL Stock Price Prediction for 2026\n\nBullish: 66.72 Average: 52.28 Bearish: 41.19\n\nForecast models widen significantly for 2026, signaling higher uncertainty. The broader range reflects the mixed impact of premium demand versus potential headwinds from elevated fuel prices, new labor agreements and competitive capacity increases.\n\nDAL Stock Price Prediction for 2030\n\nBullish: 95.38 Average: 74.62 Bearish: 58.81\n\nLong-term projections suggest meaningful upside for DAL, expecting the airline to benefit from a more efficient fleet, fully normalized international routes and continued growth in loyalty-program revenue. High-margin SkyMiles income may act as a shock absorber against the inherent volatility of fuel and labor costs.\n\nInvestment Considerations\n\nTariffs remain one of Delta's biggest strategic risks. Additional fees on foreign aircraft and components could elevate expenses and slow fleet upgrades. Shifting capex toward untaxed domestic options might also limit fleet modernization and restrict long-haul route expansion.\n\nEconomic downturns represent another key threat. Even though premium travel tends to be resilient, a sharp global slowdown could hit corporate travel budgets and weaken demand at the top of the fare pyramid \u2014 a core profit driver for Delta.\n\nInvestors should closely monitor the health of Delta's loyalty program, as it provides reliable cash flow that often offsets cyclical fluctuations in ticket revenue. At the same time, monitoring jet fuel hedging strategies and unit-cost trends will be essential for evaluating the airline's ability to maintain margin discipline.\n\nDelta's long-term outlook remains tied to its success in balancing premium-focused strategy with operational efficiency. If the airline manages to stabilize costs and grow its high-margin revenue streams, DAL could offer significant upside \u2014 but risks remain firmly in play as global competition and tariff uncertainty continue to evolve.\n\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market\n\nWhen evaluating any stock price forecast, it's wise to think about portfolio balance and not rely on a single company's trajectory. Markets shift quickly, and putting all of your capital into one sector or stock can increase risk. Many investors are turning to platforms that open the door to real estate, professional financial advice, fixed-income products, and even self-directed retirement options. These tools make it easier to diversify, smooth out volatility, and build wealth across multiple asset classes over time.\n\nArrived Homes\n\nBacked by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds\n\nFor those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial\n\nSelf-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nSoFi Alt Investments\n\nSoFi gives members access to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.\n\nRange Wealth Management\n\nRange Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold\n\nFor investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\n\nSee Next:\n\nThe \u2018ChatGPT of marketing' just opened a $0.81 per share round \u2014 10,000+ investors are already in.

Professional money managers struggle to beat the S&P 500 on a consistent basis, as evidenced by a bet Buffett made in 2007. The S&P 500 returned 1,820% over the last three decades (10.3% annually), a pace that would turn $450 per month into $940,200.10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history, but some of his best advice is often overlooked by traders in search of the next great stock.\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting in 2021. Investors have several options, but Buffett himself selected the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) when going head-to-head with a hedge fund in the early 2000s.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nFollowing Buffett's advice could turn $450 per month into $940,200. Here's what investors should know.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides exposure to many of the most influential companies\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 tracks the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which measures the performance of 500 large U.S. companies. Included in the benchmark index are value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors. The S&P 500 is usually seen as the best gauge for the overall domestic stock market because it covers about 80% of domestic equities by market value.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 also includes approximately 40% of global equities by market value, meaning it provides exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world. Listed below are the top 10 positions in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF:\n\nNvidia: 8.4%Apple: 6.8%Microsoft: 6.5%Alphabet: 5%Amazon: 4%Broadcom: 2.9%Meta Platforms: 2.4%Tesla: 2.1%Berkshire Hathaway: 1.5%JPMorgan Chase: 1.4%\n\nBuffett once bet $500,000 that he could beat a hedge fund with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffett wagered $500,000 that no professional investor could outperform an S&P 500 index fund over an extended period. He even offered to let the contender select five hedge funds. Only one asset manager accepted the challenge: Buffett went head-to-head with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners between 2008 and 2017 -- and Buffett won.\n\nThe best-performing Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 fund returned 88% during that 10-year period, and the worst fund did so poorly that it was dissolved after nine years. Meanwhile, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF returned 126%, meaning Buffett won the competition by 38 percentage points.\n\nThink about that: With nothing but an S&P 500 index fund, Buffett beat 100-plus financial experts (i.e., each of the five funds was run by a different manager, and each manager invested in many other funds run by other professionals). Yet, those financial experts charge clients exorbitant fees for their services, while the S&P 500 has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning shareholders will pay just $3 annually on every $10,000 in the fund.\n\nHow the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF can turn $450 per month into $940,200\n\nThe S&P 500 achieved a total return of 1,820% over the last 30 years. It compounded at 10.3% annually during that period. Those decades include such a wide variety of economic and market conditions -- three recessions, three bear markets, and 13 market corrections -- that investors can reasonably assume similar returns over long periods in the future.\n\nAt that rate, $450 invested monthly in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would be worth $87,300 after one decade, $320,000 after two decades, and $940,200 after three decades, provided dividends are reinvested.\n\nHere's the bottom line: The S&P 500 has consistently produced stellar returns, such that professionals often struggle to beat the index. That makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF a good option for almost every investor, even those who prefer individual stocks. You are unlikely to find an index fund with a lower expense ratio and a better track record.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

See the stocks \u00bb\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nJust about every automaker in China is having a rough time. The market much more quickly adopted electric vehicles (EVs) and the government helped subsidize domestic automakers to bolster their technology and innovation. It worked almost too well and the result was a plethora of advanced domestic electric vehicle makers that created a brutal price war. It dealt massive blows to foreign automakers that couldn't compete on product, price, or both. To make matters worse the overall industry has a problem with production overcapacity and now Chinese automakers are rushing to export vehicles overseas, potentially bringing ultra-competitive and highly advanced EVs to the U.S. doorstep which is currently protected by steep tariffs on import vehicles.\n\nTesla has fared better than some competitors, but it has still felt the crunch in China. Recent data suggests more of the same: Tesla's sales in China dropped to 26,006 in October, the lowest in three years. Sales plunged 36% compared to the prior year, and the sales number was a far cry from September's figure of 71,525 when Tesla began deliveries of the Model Y L, a longer-wheelbase and six-seat version of the Model Y. Tesla's share of China's EV market checked in at a modest 3.2% in October, down substantially from 8.7% in September and its lowest again in three years.\n\nThe silver lining, although it isn't much of one, is that Tesla's exports of China-made vehicles rose to a two-year high of 35,491 last month. Unfortunately, that silver lining only extends so far, and Tesla's struggles are widespread. In October, Tesla sales fell 23% year over year in four markets: North America, Europe, China, and South Korea, according to data tracked by Wells Fargo's Colin Langan.\n\nImage source: Tesla.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nWith Tesla's sales lagging in key markets around the world, and analysts expecting a slowdown in the North American EV market after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired at the end of September, one might think Tesla's stock would be in the dumps. That's far from the case -- Tesla's valuation remains insanely lofty at a price-to-earnings of roughly 290 and its market capitalization is more than Ford Motor Company and General Motors combined 10 times over.\n\nThat's simply because investors and analysts are focused on Tesla's future potential. In fact, shareholders just approved with a 75% rate a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that's valued at up to $1 trillion. The kicker is that many of Musk's milestones are based on future businesses: He needs to sell cars but also 10 million driver assistance subscriptions, 1 million robots, and commercially operate 1 million robotaxis.\n\nUltimately, shareholders' vote on Musk's compensation package comes at an ideal time for investors to also revisit their investing thesis on Tesla. Tesla has the ability to innovate its way to a lucrative future based on AI, robotics, and driverless vehicles, but right now it's still mostly an automaker and that business isn't great currently. Investors would be wise to expect a few bumpy quarters from Tesla as it tries to navigate choppy waters that include an aging lineup, mounting lawsuits, consumer backlash and declining sales, struggling profits, a slow ramp in its robotaxi business, among other headwinds.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone \u2014 don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nJim and his wife, Carla, 60, live in suburban Colorado. Carla works part-time at a local library, bringing in about $18,000 a year, which helps cover health insurance for now. They raised two kids, both grown, and their four-bedroom home is fully paid off. No pensions, no rental income, just a carefully built nest egg worth $980,000 split across three buckets:\n\n$570,000 in a traditional 401(k) $220,000 in a Roth IRA $190,000 in a taxable brokerage account\n\nThey also have $38,000 in a high-yield savings account for emergencies. Their monthly expenses hover around $4,200. Jim is planning to delay Social Security until age 67 to lock in a higher benefit, but until then, the couple has to rely on what they've saved.\n\nThe problem: withdrawing from the wrong account too early\u2014or in the wrong order\u2014could lead to thousands in unnecessary taxes over time. Jim knows that once he turns 73, required minimum distributions, or RMDs, will force him to pull from his tax-deferred 401(k) whether he wants to or not. That worries him, especially if it pushes him into a higher tax bracket later.\n\nCarla, who took time off to raise their children and only began contributing to a Roth in her 50s, doesn't have much in retirement savings herself. Jim always figured his plan would be enough for both of them.\n\nThe Classic Debate: Taxable, Then Tax-Deferred?\n\nFinancial planners often promote the \"classic\" withdrawal order:\n\nTaxable brokerage accounts Tax-deferred accounts like traditional 401(k)s or IRAs Tax-free Roth accounts last, to let them grow as long as possible\n\nThe idea is to tap into funds with the lowest tax consequence first, preserving the tax-advantaged growth of the others. But that assumes you're not planning Roth conversions or trying to qualify for health insurance subsidies.\n\nJim's in a gray zone. With no Social Security yet and a low current income, his effective tax rate is unusually low. That's where the Roth conversion crowd chimes in.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets \u2014 Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nWhat If Jim Did Roth Conversions?\n\nSome advisors argue that early retirement\u2014especially before RMDs or Social Security\u2014can be the perfect time to do small Roth conversions, pulling money from the 401(k) at low tax rates and converting it into a Roth to avoid higher taxes later.\n\nFinancial expert Suze Orman has even called not taking advantage of a Roth conversion one of her \"biggest money mistakes,\" saying she missed a key chance to let her savings grow tax-free.\n\nBut that strategy means paying taxes now\u2014and Jim isn't sure he's emotionally ready to see his balance drop just to save on future taxes.\n\nThe ACA Wildcard\n\nIf Carla retires in two years, they'll need to buy health insurance on the marketplace. Here's where things get tricky: any extra income, even from a 401(k) withdrawal, could disqualify them from getting Affordable Care Act subsidies, costing them thousands per year in premiums.\n\nIf Jim relies too heavily on his 401(k) for the next few years, he might unknowingly price himself out of affordable health insurance.\n\nWhat If He Just Stuck to the Brokerage Account?\n\nLet's say Jim pulls $50,000 a year from the brokerage account for now. Because it's mostly long-term capital gains, he could pay very little in taxes\u2014maybe even zero if his taxable income stays low. This would preserve his Roth and 401(k) balances while avoiding ACA traps.\n\nBut that also means selling investments, giving up long-term compounding, and potentially triggering capital gains. Plus, it's not a permanent solution\u2014he'll still need to deal with the 401(k) eventually.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate\u2014Get Institutional Access Yourself\n\nAnd If He Starts With the 401(k)?\n\nIf Jim pulled from his 401(k) instead\u2014say, $50,000 this year\u2014that money would be taxed as ordinary income. He'd stay in the 12% federal bracket, but every withdrawal raises his taxable income, making future ACA subsidies harder to qualify for.\n\nThe Roth Temptation\n\nThen there's the Roth IRA, sitting untouched. It's tax-free. It's flexible. It's tempting. But draining it now could mean giving up one of the most powerful tools for tax-free compounding and inheritance.\n\nExperts often advise retirees to save Roths for last\u2014or at least for unexpected expenses that would otherwise trigger a tax hit.\n\nNo One-Size-Fits-All Plan\n\nIn Jim's case, there's no perfect answer. He could prioritize the brokerage account and sprinkle in small Roth conversions from his 401(k) while he's in a low bracket. He could delay drawing from the Roth until much later. Or he could split his withdrawals across all three to smooth out taxes over time.\n\nIt's not about finding the right account to draw from. It's about managing the long-term tax impact, avoiding benefit cliffs, and maintaining flexibility in a world full of unknowns.\n\nBut Jim's question isn't unusual\u2014and he's not the only retiree looking at a pile of savings and wondering, Now what?\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Zoox is also operating test fleets in Austin, Seattle, Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla (TSLA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA]), which had been viewed as a robotaxi frontrunner, has been operating in Austin and San Francisco with safety drivers in its vehicles. It also recently received a ride-hailing permit in Arizona.\n\nWe asked Seeking Alpha analysts Cash Flow Venue [https://seekingalpha.com/author/cash-flow-venue] and Bernard Zambonin [https://seekingalpha.com/author/bernard-zambonin] if they thought Tesla was losing the robotaxi race to commercialization in the U.S.\n\nCash Flow Venue [https://seekingalpha.com/author/cash-flow-venue]: Although I\u2019m quite bearish on Tesla (TSLA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA]), I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s \u201closing,\u201d but it certainly is quite behind in the \u201crace\u201d to full commercial robotaxi scale. Despite many bold statements from CEO Elon Musk (e.g., millions of Tesla's robotaxis through 2026), there are no signs suggesting Tesla (TSLA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA]) could deliver on that.\n\nI have to give it to them\u2014they have the manufacturing strength, massive installed base, and vision\u2011only autonomy strategy, which could pay off. Still, I can\u2019t ignore the fact that Tesla trails Waymo (GOOG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG]) (GOOGL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL]) in demonstrated driverless operations and verified safety/performance metrics. Unless Tesla ramps up fast and avoids regulatory/safety setbacks, it risks being reactive rather than dominant in this space.\n\nBernard Zambonin [https://seekingalpha.com/author/bernard-zambonin]: Tesla (TSLA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA]) is losing an endurance race that\u2019s still in its first stint. It just started from the back of the pack and needs to climb up to gain positions. I think Tesla's chances of becoming an emerging winner in the robotaxi race are due to the combination of already having a massive existing vehicle fleet and also having a data-rich approach, with millions of customer cars already on the road equipped with cameras, onboard compute, and continuous software logging. Over the long run, this gives Tesla (TSLA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA]) the potential for a structural advantage in terms of technological and regulatory alignment.\n\nMORE ON TESLA, ALPHABET, ETC.\n\n \t* Amazon: Scoop Up This Bargain Hiding In Plain Sight Now [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846170-amazon-scoop-up-bargain-hiding-in-plain-sight-now]\n \t* Alphabet: Five Reasons To Buy The Shares [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846093-alphabet-five-reasons-to-buy-the-shares]\n \t* Amazon: OpenAI Deal Is A Game Changer [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846091-amazon-openai-deal-is-a-game-changer]\n \t* Google touts voluntary exit deals to UK employees - report [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524632-google-touts-voluntary-exit-deals-to-uk-employees---report]\n \t* Record number of shoppers expected to turn out during Thanksgiving weekend -- NRF [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524606-record-number-of-shoppers-expected-to-turn-out-during-thanksgiving-weekend---nrf]\n\n ", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524713-sa-asks-is-tesla-losing-the-robotaxi-race-to-commercialization?utm_source=feed_news_all&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;feed_item_type=news", "symbols": ["AMZN.US", "BIDU.US", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "LYFT.US", "PONY.US", "TSLA.US", "UBER.US"], "tags": ["AUTONOMOUS-VEHICLES", "CONSUMER", "CONSUMER\u00a0", "REGULATION", "ROBOTAXI", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.949, "neg": 0.048, "neu": 0.87, "pos": 0.082}}, {"date": "2025-11-22T18:14:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla's Roller Coaster Ride Continues With a Warning for Investors", "content": "Key Points\n\nTesla reported a mixed third quarter with a strong top-line result.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nA brief recap\n\nLast week, Tesla reported record third-quarter revenue that topped Wall Street estimates thanks to a rush to buy electric vehicles (EVs) to lock in a key tax credit ahead of its expiration at the end of September. Total revenue was $28.1 billion during the third quarter, which topped analysts' average estimate of $26.37 billion, according to LSEG.\n\nThe EV maker didn't do as well on the bottom line or other metrics, however. Adjusted earnings per share at $0.50 were below analysts' estimates calling for $0.55. Another closely watched metric -- the company's gross margin excluding regulatory credits -- checked in at 15.4% compared to an average estimate of 15.6%, according to Visible Alpha.\n\nTesla's roughly 60% rebound in share price over the past six months and its $1.5 trillion market cap -- more than Ford and General Motors combined many times over -- is based more on the company's potential transformation to an AI, robotaxi service, and robotics business.\n\nArguably at the forefront of that hype is its robotaxi service that was launched in limited capacity over the summer. But on that front, investors might want to pump the brakes, according to a former Tesla employee.\n\nAndrej Karpathy, the company's former head of AI who led the company's Autopilot and self-driving programs, said in a podcast that he would \"push back\" on the idea that progress on autonomous vehicles by Tesla and Alphabet's Waymo means that all the technology's problems are solved. While autonomous driving developers have hit several milestones and progress continues, Karpathy thinks that there are still several steps on the road to full autonomy.\n\nKarpathy isn't the only person pushing back. The number of lawsuits facing Tesla and its claims of full self-driving capability are mounting, as are settlements and losses. Musk has claimed time and time again over the past few years that his company was close to having fully autonomous vehicles, but even its recent robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, still used a human supervisor in the vehicles. It's top competitor, Waymo, moved beyond that requirement in 2020.\n\nA Tesla Cybertruck. Image source: Tesla\n\nWhat it all means\n\nTesla is an intriguing and polarizing company with an equally compelling CEO at the wheel, and it has made many long-term investors very wealthy. But its valuation and market cap are in otherworldly territory, based partly on hype surrounding driverless vehicle technology, which the company is far from mastering or turning into a highly scaled and profitable business.\n\nOne only has to look at CEO, Elon Musk's, recent compensation package that was passed with 75% approval from shareholders and could be worth up to $1 trillion. Much of that value is unlocked through milestones that suggest where the company is heading. Musk will of course still have to deliver vehicles and reaching 20 million deliveries is one milestone, but there's also one million robotaxis in commercial operation, one million Optimus robots, and 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and $400 billion in core profit.\n\nTesla's best days may be ahead of it, but investors need to understand the higher-risk ride they're going on: Tesla isn't just an automaker, it's becoming a technology company heading toward uncertain territory.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

He cited the collapse of the multiple to net asset value of Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) to 1.\n\n\u201cI think this is enough to signify the sell-off is over and to eventually disprove those who think the halving cycle remains valid,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cA rally into year-end is my base case.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has pared some of its losses to most recently trade near $92,000.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nBill Gates Invests Billions in Green Tech \u2014 This Tree-Free Material Could Be the Next Big Breakthrough If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nThis article Crypto Market Crash 'A Generational Opportunity For Long Term Investors,' Bitwise Investment Chief Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-market-crash-generational-opportunity-173107724.html", "symbols": ["1NVDA.MI", "1TSLA.MI", "BMNR.US", "BTC.CC", "ETH.CC", "MSTR.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F", "SOL.CC", "TL0.BE", "TL0.F", "TL01.F", "TSLA.MX"], "tags": ["BITCOIN", "CRYPTOCURRENCY", "MARKET-VOLATILITY", "STABLECOINS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.976, "neg": 0.038, "neu": 0.861, "pos": 0.1}}, {"date": "2025-11-22T17:00:07+00:00", "title": "SA Asks: Can Amazon's Zoox catch up to Alphabet's Waymo?", "content": "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News\n\nAmazon's (AMZN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN]) Zoox recently announced it was expanding its robotaxi service into San Francisco, where it will likely compete head-to-head with Alphabet's (GOOG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG]) (GOOGL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL]) Waymo.\n\nWhile Zoox is still significantly behind Waymo in terms of cities served, it appears to be picking up speed. We asked Seeking Alpha analysts Bernard Zambonin [https://seekingalpha.com/author/bernard-zambonin] and Cash Flow Venue [https://seekingalpha.com/author/cash-flow-venue] if they thought Zoox could eventually catch up to Waymo in the burgeoning robotaxi market.\n\nBernard Zambonin [https://seekingalpha.com/author/bernard-zambonin]: Zoox (AMZN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN]) can absolutely catch up to Waymo (GOOG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG]) (GOOGL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL]) in the foreseeable future. Although the gap between the two is already significant (5+ major cities in operation for Waymo versus Zoox being limited to Las Vegas, and still with restrictions), we\u2019re still talking about a market that hasn\u2019t truly begun to be explored.\n\nIn Zoox\u2019s favor, a purpose-built vehicle theoretically gives it the best unit economics among existing robotaxi offerings\u2014at least until Tesla\u2019s (TSLA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA]) robotaxi proves otherwise.\n\nCash Flow Venue [https://seekingalpha.com/author/cash-flow-venue]: I think Zoox (AMZN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN]) can catch up to Waymo (GOOG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG]) (GOOGL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL]), but it would be quite a climb. It has the backing, resources, and a bold purpose\u2011built robotaxi design that could give it agility and long\u2011term advantage.\n\nI like to play the devil\u2019s advocate from time to time, and with that in mind, I have to say that Waymo already has meaningful scale, validated technology, and regulatory momentum. Zoox would need to accelerate deployment, prove safety at scale, and build network effects quickly to close that gap. If I were to place a bet, I\u2019m team Waymo.\n\nMORE ON AMAZON, ALPHABET\n\n \t* Amazon: Scoop Up This Bargain Hiding In Plain Sight Now [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846170-amazon-scoop-up-bargain-hiding-in-plain-sight-now]\n \t* Alphabet: Five Reasons To Buy The Shares [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846093-alphabet-five-reasons-to-buy-the-shares]\n \t* Amazon: OpenAI Deal Is A Game Changer [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846091-amazon-openai-deal-is-a-game-changer]\n \t* Google touts voluntary exit deals to UK employees - report [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524632-google-touts-voluntary-exit-deals-to-uk-employees---report]\n \t* Record number of shoppers expected to turn out during Thanksgiving weekend -- NRF [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524606-record-number-of-shoppers-expected-to-turn-out-during-thanksgiving-weekend---nrf]\n\n ", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524711-sa-asks-can-amazons-zoox-catch-up-to-alphabets-waymo?utm_source=feed_news_all&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;feed_item_type=news", "symbols": ["AMZN.US", "BIDU.US", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "LYFT.US", "PONY.US", "TSLA.US", "UBER.US"], "tags": ["AUTONOMOUS-VEHICLES", "COMPETITION", "CONSUMER", "CONSUMER\u00a0", "ROBOTAXI", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.016, "neu": 0.847, "pos": 0.138}}]
