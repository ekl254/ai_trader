[{"date": "2025-11-24T14:06:24+00:00", "title": "Google\u2019s Gemini 3 advances shake up AI competitive landscape", "content": "Investing.com -- The artificial intelligence landscape is experiencing a significant shift as Google\u2019s recent advances with its Gemini 3 model create volatility across AI-related stocks.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw its stock rise over 4% on Monday, adding to last week\u2019s gain of 8%, while Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6% last week as investors reassess competitive positioning in the AI race.\n\nAccording to Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes, Google\u2019s AI comeback represents the most important issue in AI right now. The November 18 release of Gemini 3 Pro with its new Deep Think reasoning mode has impressed analysts with benchmarks and pricing that outperformed expectations, especially compared to Microsoft\u2019s recent Ignite conference and ChatGPT 5\u2019s August release.\n\nGemini 3 topped benchmarks for coding, tool use, math, science, and multimodal reasoning. The model is immediately available across Google\u2019s ecosystem and third-party platforms like GitHub and Replit, potentially helping Google\u2019s profitable API business.\n\nGoogle\u2019s custom TPU chip, now in its seventh generation, has become a significant advantage. Reitzes notes that Gemini 3 was trained primarily on Google TPUs, giving Alphabet a price advantage. Outside of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, the TPU is considered the most proven AI chip with the most tangible momentum.\n\nThis progress has created concerns for OpenAI, with CEO Sam Altman acknowledging in an internal memo that Google\u2019s advances could create \"temporary economic headwinds.\" This admission, combined with reports of slower user growth, has impacted investor confidence in OpenAI and affected stocks like Oracle, AMD, Microsoft, CoreWeave, Broadcom, and Nvidia.\n\nAMD and Oracle appear most exposed to OpenAI\u2019s success. AMD has fallen 23% from its October high, while Oracle is down 39% from its September peak. AMD\u2019s deal with OpenAI involves adding 6GW of capacity starting in the second half of 2026, while Oracle has included a $300 billion deal with OpenAI in its RPO backlog.\n\nFor investors seeking safer options amid AI volatility, Reitzes suggests Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Apple is described as a \"toll road\" to mobile AI that can benefit regardless of which company ultimately dominates the AI race. The analyst maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a $345 price target.\n\nIBM offers stability through its mainframe cycle and infrastructure software, with promising developments in quantum computing. Cisco is gaining ground selling optics to hyperscalers for AI while benefiting from a campus switching cycle in enterprise.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) faces challenges from Google\u2019s AI image generation and editing tools, which could potentially draw users away from Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud ecosystem despite their partnership to integrate Gemini 3.\n\nRelated articles\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini 3 advances shake up AI competitive landscape\n\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\n\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-gemini-3-advances-shake-140624037.html", "symbols": ["1GOOG.MI", "1GOOGL.MI", "AAPL.US", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEC.F", "ADBE.US", "AMD.US", "CSCO.US", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.BA"], "tags": ["AI", "EARNINGS", "PRICE TARGET", "PRICE-TARGET", "SEMICONDUCTORS", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.022, "neu": 0.832, "pos": 0.147}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T13:46:12+00:00", "title": "Fubon expects the first foldable iPhone to cost $2,399", "content": "Investing.com -- Global smartphone demand is set to contract again in 2026, but foldables, and especially Apple\u2019s long-anticipated entry, will provide a rare bright spot, according to a note from Fubon Research.\n\nAnalyst Arthur Liao forecasts worldwide smartphone shipments of 1.2 billion units in 2026, a 4% year-over-year decline.\n\nHe wrote that \u201cChina shipment to be 275mn (down 3% YoY)\u201d and expects iPhone shipments to fall \u201cto 234mn (down 4% YoY).\u201d\n\nRising component costs will add pressure next year, with Fubon noting that \u201cDRAM contract prices are up over 75% compared to 4Q24\u201d and that the total bill of materials for smartphones is \u201cexpected to increase by approximately 5-7% in 2026.\u201d\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Apple\u2019s first foldable iPhone is expected to emerge as the major industry catalyst.\n\nFubon believes the device\u2019s material costs, particularly the panel, hinge and lightweight components, will push pricing toward the upper end of market expectations.\n\nWhile rumors range from $2,000 to $2,500, Fubon Research expects the iPhone price to reach \u201c$2,399,\u201d citing supply chain analysis and Apple\u2019s margin needs.\n\nDemand is expected to hinge heavily on this pricing, but Fubon is optimistic.

Uncertainty means the Fed's decision is not yet baked into prices. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nWednesday, Dec. 10, could turn out to be a very big day for the stock market and equity investors. That's the day the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting committee -- the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) -- will convene its final meeting of the year and announce whether it will cut its benchmark interest rate one last time in 2025.\n\nAs most investors are aware, the Fed's interest-rate decisions can have huge consequences for the stock market. A cut on Dec. 10 to the federal funds rate would likely push the market higher, while a decision to leave the rate at its current level would be a major disappointment and probably send indexes sharply lower. A hike to the rate is extremely unlikely.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFuture guidance is conflicted\n\nOften, the Fed telegraphs exactly what it will do far in advance of an FOMC meeting, but this time is a bit different. In recent weeks, there has been considerable uncertainty in the market about whether the FOMC will cut its benchmark interest rate again at its final meeting of the year.\n\nAt its last meeting, which took place in late October, the FOMC cut the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point. That should have been a reason for investors to cheer.\n\nHowever, Fed chair Jerome Powell rained on Wall Street's parade by suggesting in his post-meeting press conference that a December cut was no sure thing, even though the market had been expecting another cut at the next meeting. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it,\" he told reporters. That sent stocks and the S&P 500 index lower.\n\nHowever, last Friday, Nov. 21, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, John C. Williams, hinted in a speech that another cut is likely in December. Williams, who heads the most important Federal Reserve bank and so has a bigger megaphone than most Fed officials other than Powell, said the current fed funds rate is \"modestly restrictive\" -- meaning that it's slowing economic activity at a time when the labor market has cooled off.\n\nGrowing confusion in the futures market\n\nAnd so, Williams concluded, there is \"room for a further adjustment in the near term to the target range for the federal funds rate to move the stance of policy closer to the range of neutral.\" That's Fed speak for \"a December cut is probably appropriate.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBetween Powell's press conference remarks in October and Williams' speech last week, the market is now officially confused. A month ago, before Powell spoke, futures traders put the odds of a December rate cut at near-certainty, 98.1%. After he spoke that fell dramatically to 44.4% (as of Nov. 14). Now, after Williams' Friday speech, traders have jacked the chances of a cut back up to 71.4%. Those are major and unusually large shifts just a few weeks before an FOMC meeting, and they signal that the market doesn't really know what to expect.\n\nAnd that uncertainty about what the Fed will do on Dec. 10 creates fertile ground for a major move in markets that day.\n\nInvestors, please fasten your seatbelts: We may experience turbulence ahead.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

There, Walmart is optimistic too.\n\n\"Holiday is off to a pretty good start,\" Rainey said on the company's earnings call. \"Back-to-school tends to be an early indicator for how that goes, Halloween, likewise for Thanksgiving, and everything that we've seen so far makes us optimistic and encouraged about customers and members leaning into the seasonal events and holiday shopping period.\" Thu, November 20, 2025 at 12:41 PM UTC\n\nGrace O'Donnell\n\nWalmart earnings surpass estimates as retailer lifts guidance\n\nYahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports:\n\nRead more here.

Taiwan Semiconductor is growing rapidly thanks to the AI race. 10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing \u203a\n\nAt the time of this writing, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's second-largest company by market cap, with a $4 trillion valuation. So, predicting that a much smaller company like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) can grow to become larger than Apple is a bold claim, especially when you consider that Taiwan Semi is a $1.4 trillion company right now. However, after looking at growth rates for the industries in which it's involved, I think Taiwan Semiconductor can achieve this feat, making it an incredible stock pick over the next few years.\n\nI think Taiwan Semi could grow to become a larger company than Apple by 2030, but it's going to need a lot of help to accomplish that goal.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is front and center in the AI race\n\nApple doesn't need a lot of introduction. It's a leader in consumer electronics, and there's a good chance that this article is being read from an Apple-powered device. But therein lies the largest issue with Apple: market saturation. Apple has failed to grow revenue at a meaningful pace over the past few years, and it has only had one reported quarter of double-digit revenue growth since mid-2022 (and it only achieved that mark if you round up).AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nApple has done a great job repurchasing shares and decreasing expenses, which has allowed its diluted earnings per share (EPS) to grow in the low-double-digit range. As a result, we'll use 12% as Apple's long-term EPS growth rate.\n\nFor Taiwan Semiconductor, it's at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Its chips are being used in nearly every high-powered AI computing device, ranging from Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to custom AI accelerators from Broadcom. Furthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor is launching new chip technology that promises to improve energy consumption by 25% to 30% when configured for the same speed as previous generations. That's game-changing technology, and allows TSMC to charge a premium for those chips.\n\nFurthermore, there are no signs of the AI race slowing down. The other day, AMD released its projection that it expects its data center division to grow revenue at a 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030. That aligns well with a previous projection given by Nvidia, where global data center capital expenditures are expected to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by 2030. That indicates a 42% CAGR at the midpoint, showcasing that TSMC's chip business can easily grow at that rate as well.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring Q3, Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue rose 41% in U.S. dollars, aligning with the broader market growth. That aligned with TSMC's net income growth as well, so I'll use a 40% EPS growth rate for this projection.\n\nWhile that may seem like an aggressive assumption, it's what's required for TSMC to surpass Apple in market share by 2030. If the AI data center market is as large as the AMD and Nvidia projections, then this assumption may not be unreasonable.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has huge upside if this projection pans out\n\nIf Apple can grow its EPS by 12% throughout 2030 and Taiwan Semiconductor's rises by 40%, that would result in Apple having $13.52 in diluted EPS by the end of 2030 and Taiwan Semiconductor having a jaw-dropping $57.08. That's a substantial increase from today's values.AAPL EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nTo find out how much that would be worth for each company, we need to multiply the EPS figure by the total number of shares outstanding. Then, we'll have to assign it an earnings multiple. Using today's valuation figures (Apple at 36 times earnings and Taiwan Semiconductor at 28), that would give Apple a market cap of $7.2 trillion and Taiwan Semiconductor a market cap of $8.3 trillion by 2030.\n\nWill that happen? I'm not sure. Those are massive growth assumptions baked into Taiwan Semiconductor's stock that may not pan out. But if they do, I think it has a strong chance of surpassing Apple in market cap by 2030.\n\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

There are other rumors that he will not. He has led Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2011, succeeding\u00a0Steve Jobs. He is 65, which is a traditional retirement age.\n\nQuick Read\n\nCook May Be Remembered Well Jobs Will Be Remembered Better  If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nCook was not a logical choice. He had run logistics. His job was worldwide operations, ensuring the trains ran on time. They did, for the most part. There was a problem getting hardware out of China on time. There was a matching supply with demand. There was a need to get the best price for manufacturing. There was sourcing the best camera parts. the best chips, and light and strongest cases\n\nHe never took Job\u2019s job. Jobs was a creative genius. He invented the Mac and iPhone. He built the early operating systems. He ran the software operations and design. He was considered the greatest CEO of the 20th and early 21st Centuries.\n\nWhat Cook did was build more and more generations of iPhones. Each was better than the one before, so people kept coming. Eventually, Apple had 2.1 trillion devices worldwide, making it the most extensive \u201cwalled garden\u201d on earth. And, he made sure there were reasons to stay inside the walled garden with Apple software products.\n\nApple\u2019s stock rose 132% over the last five years. The S&P 500 was up about 88% over the same period. After keeping the top market cap spot off and on, it is at $4 trillion today, just behind Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) $4.3 trillion.\n\nAlthough Cook could not increase sales for Macs and iPads. They were stagnant. New products like Watch were a failure financially. However, he did build a massive business which Apple calls Services, It is now almost 30% of Apple\u2019s revenue. Its is almost everything Apple sells beyond its hardware\n\nIf, over time, Cook is blamed for problems, they will fall into two categories. The first is that he could not hold on to the top market share spot in China. Local companies overwhelmed its share. And, as of now, Apple does not have an AI product, which leaves it a year behind the industry.\n\nOn balance, Cook\u2019s tenure will be considered successful\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

The data for the last decade bodes well for Thanksgiving week 2025. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nThis week is Thanksgiving week, which is a holiday-shortened week for the U.S. stock market. The market will be closed on Thanksgiving Day -- Thursday, Nov. 27 -- and will close at 1 p.m. on the following day, known as \"Black Friday.\"\n\nFrom an investing standpoint, investors have reason to be thankful. In 2025 through Friday, Nov. 21, the S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index have gained 12.3% and 15.3%, respectively. Their total returns (which include dividends) are 13.6% and 16%, respectively, over this period. These returns are somewhat higher than the stock market's long-term historical average of about 10%.\n\nI was wondering whether the stock market tends to outperform, underperform, or perform about as expected during Thanksgiving week, relative to the year in general. So, I decided to dig into this question.\n\nTo be clear -- The Motley Fool espouses long-term investing. Moreover, timing the market is very difficult, so I don't recommend it. Nonetheless, I believe all knowledge is beneficial.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDoes the stock market tend to outperform, underperform, or perform about as expected during Thanksgiving week?\n\nThere are usually 52 weeks in each year (every five or six years, there are 53 weeks in a year). So, there are usually 52 trading weeks (of varying lengths) each year. Thus, if the stock market performed about as expected on a given Thanksgiving week, it would roughly correspond to 1/52nd of that year's performance. For example, if, in a given year, the S&P 500 index (the best proxy for the overall U.S. stock market) gained 26%, a Thanksgiving week gain of roughly 0.5% would be about as expected.\n\nI looked at the past 10 years to determine an answer to my question. While 10 years is not a very long time, it at least includes both up and down years, so it has some variability.\n\nI'll give you my findings upfront: The stock market tends to outperform during Thanksgiving week, relative to its annual performance, based on data from the past 10 years. There are likely several reasons for this phenomenon, though I won't speculate on them.\n\nLet's examine the data for the past decade. I'll be using stock market index gains and losses, rather than returns. My source for all charts is YCharts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nYear 2024\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 23.3%. Nasdaq Composite annual performance: Gain of 28.6%. Thanksgiving week (see chart below) performed better than expected, relative to the annual performances.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2023\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 24.2%. Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 43.4%. Thanksgiving week performed better than expected for the S&P 500 and about as expected for the Nasdaq, relative to the annual performances.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2022\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Loss of 19.4%. Nasdaq annual performance: Loss of 33.1%. Thanksgiving week performed significantly better than expected, relative to the annual performances.\n\nThe stock market had a bad year in 2022. Many companies were plagued by supply chain issues following the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This stemmed mainly from the fact that the U.S. and much of the world depended on China for parts and, in some cases, finished goods. And China completely shut down its economy several times during the pandemic.\n\nMany of the stocks that surged during the initial periods of the pandemic (discussed further in the 2020 section below) got clobbered in 2022.\n\nInflation -- which began increasing in 2021-- was surging in 2022 and peaked in June 2022. The rising inflation was probably mainly due to two factors -- the supply chain issues and government stimulus spending during the pandemic.\n\nAnother lesser factor in 2022's poor stock market performance may have been Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2021\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 26.9%. Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 21.4%. Thanksgiving week performed worse than expected, relative to the annual performances.\n\n2021 was a strong year for the stock market, which experienced a particularly bad Thanksgiving week. What appeared to happen here is that the market became very choppy, with notable ups and downs, in late November and December 2021. The market's struggles at the end of 2021 were prescient of the poor 2022 that was to come. Indeed, the market began a steady decline as the calendar turned from 2021 to 2022.^SPX Chart\n\nYear 2020\n\nS&P 500 annual performance: Gain of 16.3%. Nasdaq annual performance: Gain of 43.6%. Thanksgiving week performed much better than expected, relative to the annual performances.\n\nStocks fell sharply from mid-February through late March due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it didn't take long for them to come roaring back. The Nasdaq index significantly outperformed the S&P 500 because most of the stocks that benefited from the pandemic -- dubbed \"coronavirus stocks\" or \"stay-at-home stocks\" -- are listed on the Nasdaq index.

Not only was its data center platform growing rapidly, but its gaming platform also experienced significant growth, as many people were staying home more during the pandemic.

Here's how it could turn a consistent investment of $500 per month into $1 million over the long term.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA great index fund for investors of all experience levels\n\nThe S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy. The index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning its largest constituents have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft are the world's most valuable companies, with a combined market capitalization of $11.9 trillion, and all three are in the information technology sector. Hence, this is the largest sector in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.\n\nHere are the top five sectors in the index, along with their weightings, and some of their most noteworthy stocks.  Sector Sector Weighting Noteworthy Stocks Information technology 35.06% Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple Financials 13.03% Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Communication services 10.32% Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix Consumer discretionary 10.05% Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's  Healthcare 9.75% Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie\n\nData source: Vanguard, State Street. Sector weightings are accurate as of Nov. 19, 2025, and are subject to change.\n\nThe other six sectors in the S&P 500 are industrials, consumer staples, energy, utilities, real estate, and materials, so the index is highly diversified.\n\nHowever, it's hard to ignore the significant influence of the information technology sector. The S&P 500 soared by 214% over the last 10 years, and the information technology sector was responsible for more than half of that overall gain, thanks to its own eye-popping return of 640%. In fact, if we exclude the sector entirely, the S&P's return over the last decade shrinks to just 79%.\n\nThis dynamic is likely to remain in place thanks to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, quantum computing, and more, which could fuel significant returns in stocks like Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the most cost-effective ways for investors to gain like-for-like exposure to the S&P 500. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. In dollar terms, an investment of $10,000 would incur an annual fee of just $3, whereas that fee could be as high as $74 in other funds, according to Vanguard.\n\nTurning $500 per month into $1 million\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered a compound annual return of 10.5% since its inception in 1957, and if it continues to grow at that pace, it could turn a consistent monthly investment of $500 into $1 million in under 30 years: Monthly Investment Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $500 $106,829 $409,298 $1,269,709\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nThe S&P has delivered an even better average annual return of 14.4% over the last five years, as themes like AI fueled incredible growth for some of the index's largest constituents, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and more. Just last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors that annual AI infrastructure spending could hit an eye-popping $4 trillion by 2030, so momentum in this space is unlikely to slow anytime soon.\n\nHowever, even though the S&P might continue generating accelerated returns over the next few years, it's also important to remember that volatility is a normal part of the investing journey. According to Capital Group, the index experiences a decline of 10% or more once every two and a half years, on average, and it slips into a bear market (a decline of 20% or more) every six years. These bumps in the road are the price of admission for an opportunity to earn life-changing returns over the long term.\n\nThe key to success is investing consistently, even during uncertain times. Warren Buffett is known for buying stocks in all market conditions, but especially during periods of weakness because as a value investor, he loves a bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

Continue \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nS&P 500: 216% return over the last decade (12.1% annually)\n\nThe S&P 500 measures the performance of 500 large U.S. companies that cover about 80% of domestic equities by market value. The index was created in 1957, though its precursor was introduced in the 1920s. Inclusion is limited to companies that meet specific eligibility requirements, including generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability and a minimum market value of $22.7 billion.\n\nThe S&P 500 is generally considered the best gauge for the overall U.S. stock market due to its scope and diversity. The five largest holdings in the index are listed by weight:\n\nNvidia: 7.9%Apple: 7.1%Microsoft: 6.3%Alphabet: 5.4%Amazon: 3.8%\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 216% over the last decade, compounding at 12.1% annually. Those figures do not include dividends.\n\nInvestors can get exposure to the S&P 500 by purchasing shares of an index fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average: 159% return over the last decade (10% annually)\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks the performance of 30 large U.S. companies. The index was created in 1928, though its precursor was introduced in the 1890s. Inclusion is generally limited to stocks in the S&P 500, and the selection committee typically chooses companies that have an excellent reputation, have demonstrated sustained growth, and are of widespread interest to investors\n\nThe Dow Jones is generally considered a blue chip index due to its focus on reputation and sustained growth. Unlike the S&P 500, which is weighted by market cap, the Dow Jones is weighted by share price. The five largest holdings are listed:\n\nGoldman Sachs: 10.4%Caterpillar: 7.3%Microsoft: 6.4%American Express: 4.6%Amgen: 4.5%\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 159% over the last decade, compounding at 10% annually. Those figures do not include dividends.\n\nInvestors can get exposure to the index by purchasing shares of the SPDRDow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEMKT: DIA).\n\nNasdaq Composite: 336% return over the past 10 years (15.8% annually)\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite measures the performance of more than 3,300 companies. The vast majority are U.S. companies, though it does include some international ones. The Nasdaq was created in 1971. The index is weighted by market value, and inclusion is limited to companies listed exclusively on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite is heavily weighted toward the information technology sector, so the index is generally regarded as a barometer for growth stocks. The five largest holdings are listed by weight:\n\nNvidia: 12.2%Microsoft: 10.3%Apple: 10.2%Alphabet: 7.4%Amazon: 6.2%\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite advanced 336% over the last decade, compounding at 15.8% annually. That does not include reinvested dividends. Investors can get exposure to the technology-focused index with the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite ETF(NASDAQ: ONEQ).\n\nThe next decade may be more challenging for the U.S. stock market\n\nInvestors have probably heard some version of this platitude: Past performance is never a guarantee of future results. Each situation is unique, and there are exceptions to every rule.\n\nThe last decade was particularly good for the U.S. stock market. However, the next decade could be more challenging. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will likely drag on economic growth, and valuations are currently quite high by historical standards.\n\nIndeed, JPMorgan Chase analysts estimate U.S. large-cap stocks will return 6.7% annually over the next 10 to 15 years. And Goldman Sachs analysts estimate the S&P 500 will return 6.5% annually over the next decade, with downside and upside scenarios from 3% annually to 10% annually.\n\nInvestors should adjust their expectations accordingly. However, owning a few high-quality stocks purchased at reasonable valuations could help investors outperform the major indexes in the years ahead.\n\nPersonally, I own a combination of individual stocks and an S&P 500 index fund. That strategy gives me a shot at beating the market, but also prevents me from falling too far behind the market if my individual stocks perform poorly.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and S&P 500 Index wasn\u2019t one of them.

The five largest holdings in the index are listed by weight:\n\nNvidia: 7.9% Apple: 7.1% Microsoft: 6.3% Alphabet: 5.4% Amazon: 3.8%\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 216% over the last decade, compounding at 12.1% annually. Those figures do not include dividends.\n\nInvestors can get exposure to the S&P 500 by purchasing shares of an index fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average: 159% return over the last decade (10% annually)\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks the performance of 30 large U.S. companies. The index was created in 1928, though its precursor was introduced in the 1890s. Inclusion is generally limited to stocks in the S&P 500, and the selection committee typically chooses companies that have an excellent reputation, have demonstrated sustained growth, and are of widespread interest to investors\n\nThe Dow Jones is generally considered a blue chip index due to its focus on reputation and sustained growth. Unlike the S&P 500, which is weighted by market cap, the Dow Jones is weighted by share price. The five largest holdings are listed:\n\nGoldman Sachs: 10.4% Caterpillar: 7.3% Microsoft: 6.4% American Express: 4.6% Amgen: 4.5%\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 159% over the last decade, compounding at 10% annually. Those figures do not include dividends.\n\nInvestors can get exposure to the index by purchasing shares of the SPDRDow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEMKT: DIA).\n\nNasdaq Composite: 336% return over the past 10 years (15.8% annually)\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite measures the performance of more than 3,300 companies. The vast majority are U.S. companies, though it does include some international ones. The Nasdaq was created in 1971. The index is weighted by market value, and inclusion is limited to companies listed exclusively on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite is heavily weighted toward the information technology sector, so the index is generally regarded as a barometer for growth stocks. The five largest holdings are listed by weight:\n\nNvidia: 12.2% Microsoft: 10.3% Apple: 10.2% Alphabet: 7.4% Amazon: 6.2%\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite advanced 336% over the last decade, compounding at 15.8% annually. That does not include reinvested dividends. Investors can get exposure to the technology-focused index with the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite ETF(NASDAQ: ONEQ).\n\nThe next decade may be more challenging for the U.S. stock market\n\nInvestors have probably heard some version of this platitude: Past performance is never a guarantee of future results. Each situation is unique, and there are exceptions to every rule.\n\nThe last decade was particularly good for the U.S. stock market. However, the next decade could be more challenging. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will likely drag on economic growth, and valuations are currently quite high by historical standards.\n\nIndeed, JPMorgan Chase analysts estimate U.S. large-cap stocks will return 6.7% annually over the next 10 to 15 years. And Goldman Sachs analysts estimate the S&P 500 will return 6.5% annually over the next decade, with downside and upside scenarios from 3% annually to 10% annually.\n\nInvestors should adjust their expectations accordingly. However, owning a few high-quality stocks purchased at reasonable valuations could help investors outperform the major indexes in the years ahead.\n\nPersonally, I own a combination of individual stocks and an S&P 500 index fund. That strategy gives me a shot at beating the market, but also prevents me from falling too far behind the market if my individual stocks perform poorly.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and S&P 500 Index wasn\u2019t one of them.

Research compiled in 2024 by the Money and Pensions Service, for example, shows that three in four teachers believe their students do not have the key skills required to manage their money effectively.\n\nIn a major overhaul of the curriculum, the government is now aiming to close the knowledge gap. Ministers have announced that financial education will be introduced from Key Stage 1 in England\u2019s primary schools, with greater emphasis placed on money management throughout secondary education.\n\nThe government\u2019s updated curriculum places a far stronger emphasis on financial learning from an early age. The Department for Education said: \u201cPrimary pupils will also learn more about the fundamentals of money, recognising that children are now consumers often before they reach secondary school.\u201d\n\nRead more: HSBC, Halifax and Barclays cut mortgage rates ahead of budget\n\nThe reforms also make citizenship compulsory in primary schools, introducing pupils to media and financial literacy, as well as civic understanding, at an early age.\n\nThe government hopes that business leaders will also embrace the changes. Jane Gratton, of the British Chambers of Commerce, told ministers in a statement that businesses would welcome changes that improve employability.Pupils who received regular lessons through the Money Ready\u2019s Change the Game scheme were found to have financial knowledge scores 5.6% higher than those who didn\u2019t. (Money Ready)\n\nWith around 366,000 young people finishing compulsory education each year, monitoring the progress and impact of the updated curriculum is crucial for bringing about real change.\n\nLeon Ward, CEO of Money Ready, a financial education charity campaigning for change, told Yahoo Finance UK: \u201cInclusion in the curriculum is just the first step. The real challenge is making sure it\u2019s delivered consistently, by trained teachers, with resources that actually work.\u201d\n\nWard\u2019s organisation reaches more than 50,000 people each year, from primary pupils to young adults. He has seen first-hand how early intervention can make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe were thrilled to see financial education front and centre in the curriculum review. Introducing it from Key Stage 1 brings England in line with other UK nations,\u201d said Ward.The government\u2019s updated curriculum places a far stronger emphasis on financial learning from an early age. (Money Ready)\n\nHowever, he believes that policy alone won\u2019t be enough and notes that, despite financial education becoming part of the curriculum, provision remains patchy.\n\nTeachers need proper funding, training and dedicated time in the school day, he said, adding that without that support, there\u2019s a real risk of repeating the same mistakes.\n\nRead more: UK rental growth slows to 5% in October as house prices also lose momentum\n\nStory continues\n\nMoney Ready\u2019s Change the Game programme, evaluated over three years by King\u2019s College London, found pupils who received regular lessons through the scheme had financial knowledge scores 5.6% higher than those who didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd all teachers surveyed as part of the programme agreed that financial education was vital, while also flagging that support is essential if it\u2019s going to succeed.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t just be a box-ticking exercise. To really shift the dial, we need to build it into how schools assess and prioritise learning,\u201d Ward added.\n\nMoney struggles\n\nResearch published by Santander this year shows that most 18\u201321-year-olds lack basic money skills, with 79% having never budgeted, 76% having never paid a bill and 77% never saving for emergencies. Nearly a third rely on TikTok influencers for financial advice, while only 17% say they\u2019ve received guidance from their bank.\n\nEighteen-year-old Aimee, who lives in south-west England and chose not to give her last name, took part in a Money Ready financial education session. Like most of those surveyed by Santander, she had never budgeted, paid a bill or saved for an emergency. She told Yahoo Finance UK she had almost no understanding of how to manage money.\n\n\u201cAs a young person with extremely limited financial knowledge, I was terrified to go into the adult world, not even knowing how to budget, never mind paying rent and water bills,\u201d she said.Aimee, 18, from south-west England told Yahoo Finance UK she had almost no understanding of how to manage money. (Money Ready)\n\nAimee said the session was nothing like the formal lecture she\u2019d expected.\n\n\u201cI needed to take a course, obviously. My personal spending wasn\u2019t great. But talking through why I spent so much money on takeaways was such an easy and natural conversation that I never felt embarrassed to talk about my money struggles,\u201d she said.\n\nThrough the non-judgmental session, she learned in detail about loans and credit, APR, payday loans, buy now, pay later schemes and taxes.\n\nParents back money lessons for children\n\nThis year, research from Yorkshire Building Society showed strong parental support for earlier financial education, with 89% saying money skills should be taught in school.\n\nThe study also found that one in 10 parents never discuss money with their children, and only 24% do so at least once a week.\n\nRead more: UK inflation rate falls for first time in five months to 3.6% in October\n\nFor Ward, it\u2019s also about empowerment. \u201cIf we get this right, we won\u2019t just prevent financial mistakes\u2014we\u2019ll build a generation that feels confident and in control of their future,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming financially literate is something that Aimee would encourage every young person to do \u2013 and if the new curriculum is successful, they\u2019ll soon get their chance\n\n\u201cFinancial education is paramount to living independently.

If you take the right approach to finding bargains during the sale, this can be a fantastic opportunity to save money on Christmas presents and special gifts for yourself. However, if you fall foul of the deadly Black Friday mistakes, you can end up wasting hundreds of pounds.\n\nIt's not our fault that it\u2019s so easy to overspend on the day. There\u2019s a whole industry devoted to getting us to part with our money, and they have a number of dastardly tricks up their sleeves. It\u2019s worth knowing what retailers are up to, so you can protect yourself.\n\nMaking you think the event is unmissable\n\nYou may already have been hoodwinked by a couple of their sales techniques. Retailers have been sending emails and posting endlessly on social media about the fabulous bargains on offer.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just them helpfully letting you know about deals. They\u2019re repeatedly sending you the message that this event is unmissable. It can make you feel you have to join in and buy something, even if there\u2019s nothing you really need.\n\nRead more: 15 ways to save money when you're single\n\nPushing deals out early\n\nAnother common tactic is to push out deals early, and then provide an extra discount on the day. They\u2019re hoping that the excitement as the clock ticks down to Friday will prove too much, and you\u2019ll buy before their deepest discounts are unveiled.If you fall foul of the deadly Black Friday mistakes, you can end up wasting hundreds of pounds.\u00b7Richard Baker via Getty Images\n\nTaking advantage that you may not shop around\n\nIf you wait for the day itself, take care not to be drawn in by another technique where they have a limited number of items on sale, sometimes only for a very short period of time. This creates the idea of scarcity, so we rush into making a purchase without shopping around or giving it enough thought.\n\nSome retailers will take advantage of the fact we\u2019re in a hurry so may not shop around. They\u2019ll charge more for an item for a period before Black Friday, and then mark it up with a big discount on the day. It means they can offer a huge price cut \u2013 and yet it might still be cheaper elsewhere.\n\nShifting old stock\n\nOthers will take the opportunity to shift old stock. If you\u2019re not desperate for the latest version, it\u2019s a great chance to save by buying an old model. However, don\u2019t fall into the trap of comparing prices against those of something newer. Check exactly what\u2019s on sale.\n\nPursuading you to trade up\n\nThe other risk is that you\u2019re persuaded to trade up, because they\u2019re offering a deal on the luxury model. If you need something top-of-the-range, then this is a saving, but if you were perfectly happy with the basic model, you could end up paying more for features you\u2019ll never use.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from all of these risks is to go in with a game plan. Make a list of everything you definitely need \u2013 either for yourself or as Christmas presents. If it\u2019s a gadget or technology, make a note of the model you\u2019re after or the features you need.\n\nRead more: Why shorter days are bad for your finances\n\nThen shop around and work out what constitutes a good price for it.

Many people have fixed on low-rate mortgage deals with high early repayment charges and want to secure additional lending without losing these competitive rates or having to pay a penalty.\n\n\u201cSecond charge mortgages are most suitable if you want to borrow a substantial amount, have decent equity in your property, and don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t remortgage,\u201d says Fiona Peake, mortgages expert at Ocean Finance.\n\nWhat are second charge mortgages?\n\nSecond charge mortgages are similar to standard mortgages in that they are a loan secured against your home. It's an additional loan alongside your existing mortgage and is a way to borrow against your home's equity without changing your primary mortgage\n\n\u201cA second-charge mortgage can be useful if you want to access extra cash and are comfortable having a second mortgage,\u201d says Karen Barrett, founder of financial advice platform Unbiased.\n\nThey are a specialist product and don\u2019t tend to be available via high street lenders. That said, there is still plenty of choice in the market.\n\n\u201cYou'll be looking at around 20 to 30 in this space with the top players being the likes of United Trust Bank, Step One Finance, West One, Together Money, Norton Finance and Pepper Money,\u201d says John Everest, director of Everest Mortgage Services.\n\nRead more: What the autumn budget could mean for the property market\n\nTerms can be anything from three to 30 years, depending on how quickly you want to pay your loan off, while rates are very much dependant on a customer\u2019s credit rating and loan-to-value ratio.\n\n\u201cRates are higher than first-charge mortgage rates because the lender is second in line for repayment,\u201d says Richard Dana, founder of mortgage platform Tembo.\n\n\u201cPricing varies by lender, credit profile, equity and income, but broadly falls in the region of 6-9% for strong credit, 9-12% for mid-credit, and higher for adverse-credit cases.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nLike first charge mortgages, there\u2019s repayment or interest only options.Second charge mortgages are mortgages taken out alongside an original mortgage but with a different lender on different terms.\u00b7Gary Yeowell via Getty Images\n\nWhat are the advantages?\n\nThe main advantage \u2013 and the likely reason there\u2019s been such a jump in second charges \u2013 is that customers can raise capital without changing the terms of their first mortgage, especially important if they are still lucky enough to be on a low fixed rate.\n\nAnother advantage is that second charges can be used to raise funds for a host of things, including home improvements, tax bills and debt consolidation; the only purpose you can\u2019t use them for is to pay off gambling debts.\n\n\u201c[They] offer more flexible underwriting than traditional remortgages, which can help customers with complex income, bad credit, or non- standard circumstances,\u201d says Meadows.\n\nRead more: UK rental growth slows to 5% in October as house prices also lose momentum\n\nThis means that, when used properly, they help protect your credit rating, making your debts more manageable, and putting you in a better position for when you come to remortgage on your primary mortgage.\n\nAnother difference with traditional mortgages is the multiples you are able to borrow. \u201cHigh street lenders typically lend 4.5-5x income; second charge lenders can go 6x plus lending, with one lender in the market that could go to even 8x income in certain cases,\u201d says Everest.\n\nSecond charges often don\u2019t have any or very large early repayment charges, so you have more flexibility when it comes to settling your debt too.\n\nWhat to watch out for\n\nOne of the disadvantages of a second charge mortgage are the fees. \u201cWith a second charge mortgage, it\u2019s worth stressing that you\u2019ll have to pay fees, and you\u2019ll likely pay more interest overall,\u201d says Barrett.\n\nThese can include arrangement, legal and broker fees. \u201cLender\u2019s fees range from 1-2.5% of the initial borrowing amount, however legal costs are usually included. Broker fees are typically higher [than mortgage broker fees], \u00a31500-\u00a33000, [as] the loan sizes are generally smaller than a mortgage,\u201d says Everest.\n\nThere is also more paperwork than standard loans and a solicitor\u2019s input. \u201cThey are not a \u2018quick cash\u2019 fix,\u201d flags Peake. \u201cThey are more complicated than a personal loan, often requiring consent from your first mortgage lender and involving extra paperwork and legal steps.\u201d\n\nYou will always need to check that your first charge mortgage lender is comfortable with you taking out a second charge. \u201cNine out of 10 lenders will require consent; a few lenders do not, for example Halifax. Some lenders in the buy-to-let space do not give consent, therefore you are unable to get a second charge added at all, eg The Mortgage Works,\u201d says Everest.'A second-charge mortgage can be useful if you want to access extra cash and are comfortable having a second mortgage,' says Karen Barrett, founder of financial advice platform Unbiased.\u00b7MoMo Productions via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s also important to think about whether you will be able to afford to repay two different mortgages and remember your home is at risk if you don\u2019t keep up the repayments on both.\n\n\u201cBorrowers take on two secured commitments, which increases overall indebtedness and requires careful affordability assessment,\u201d says Meadows.\n\nSecond charge mortgages are a specialist financial product and, while you will pay a fee, you should seek the advice of a knowledgeable broker who has experience in the second charge market.\n\n\u201cBefore taking out a second charge mortgage, make sure the lender is regulated and you understand the repayment schedule\u2026 Getting professional advice or working through an experienced mortgage broker is essential, as second charge lending is specialist territory,\u201d says Peake.\n\nHow do they compare to personal loans and remortgaging?\n\nSecond charge mortgages don\u2019t work for every scenario and, often, it makes better financial sense to get a personal loan or to remortgage.

Highlighting Warren's conviction in the company, Berkshire refuses to trim its stake in the position even as it grows as a percent of overall holdings.10 stocks we like better than American Express \u203a\n\nBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has turned a small group of companies into enormous bets over the past decade, and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has dominated that list for years. Given Berkshire chairman and CEO Warren Buffett's successful track record with stocks, investors are often looking at the company's stock holdings -- especially its biggest ones -- to get investment ideas. And now a newly disclosed stake in Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has reinvigorated interest in Berkshire's investment moves.\n\nApple still soaks up more than a fifth of Berkshire's stock portfolio, and Alphabet is now a top-10 position, even if it remains modest in dollar terms compared with the conglomerate's very largest holdings. But when I think about which Buffett stock I most want to ride with for the next decade, I keep coming back to a more old-fashioned name.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP) is Berkshire's second largest equity holding and one of its longest-tenured relationships. For me, it captures the heart of Buffett's approach: a durable franchise, advantaged economics, and a business capable of sending real cash back to owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBig conviction in a great business\n\nAs of the end of Q3, Berkshire owned 151.6 million American Express shares, valued at about $50 billion. That stake accounts for close to a fifth of Berkshire's equity portfolio, firmly entrenching American Express as Buffett's No. 2 holding behind Apple.\n\nUnlike the Apple position, which Berkshire has been trimming, the American Express stake has remained unchanged for decades.\n\nThat kind of stability reflects the underlying business. American Express is a global payments company that issues cards, runs its own network, and works directly with merchants. Sitting on both sides of the transaction, it captures rich data on where and how card members spend, which helps the company target high-spending customers and refine rewards in ways rivals struggle to match.\n\nThe company's last full calendar year demonstrates how powerful that model can be.\n\nIn 2024, American Express's revenue rose 9% year over year to $65.9 billion, and earnings per share climbed 25% to $14.01. Additionally, management reported record card member spending, record fee revenue (the revenue the company collects from membership fees from its customers), and record new card acquisitions.\n\nDuring the same year, it returned $7.9 billion to shareholders through $5.9 billion of share repurchases and $2.0 billion of dividends.\n\nContinued momentum\n\nRecent quarters show that momentum has not faded. Second-quarter revenue grew 9% year over year, while earnings per share increased 17%. And third-quarter revenue growth accelerated to a rate of 11%. Earnings per share for the quarter also accelerated, rising 19% year over year.\n\nBenefitting the quarter was a refresh to its consumer and business Platinum cards in the U.S.\n\n\"The initial customer demand and engagement exceeded our expectations, with new U.S. Platinum account acquisitions doubling compared to pre-refresh levels,\" said American Express CEO Stephen Squeri in the company's third-quarter earnings release.\n\nThe successful refresh of the platinum card speaks to the company's pricing power, as it commands an annual fee of $895 -- a fee members eagerly pay to get access to airport lounges and a long list of other perks, including credits for travel, clothes, dining, and more.\n\nAnd valuation is where American Express really stands out among Buffett's big bets. The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24. While financial stocks often sport lower price-to-earnings multiples than stocks in other sectors, it's still notably below both Apple and Alphabet's price-to-earnings ratios of 36 and 30, respectively.\n\nSure, American Express is not cheap compared with many traditional financial stocks, but that multiple looks more reasonable given its consistent double-digit revenue growth, strong credit performance, and shareholder-friendly capital returns.\n\nThe risks, of course, are significant. A meaningful recession could slow card member spending and push credit losses higher, which would crimp earnings and reduce the company's ability to keep growing capital returns at the same pace. Further, competition from banks, buy-now-pay-later providers, and the big card networks remains intense.\n\nOverall, I believe the stock looks attractive despite these risks. Sure, shares could get hit pretty hard in a weak economy. So, anyone who buys the stock today should prepare for volatility and should maintain a long-term view. But I truly believe that, 10 years from now, hindsight will show this as one of Berkshire's best-performing stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in American Express, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and American Express wasn\u2019t one of them.

Indeed, AI stocks' performances almost seem to have come at everything else's expense. There's only so much investment capital to go around, after all.\n\nWith the artificial intelligence rally getting a bit long in the tooth though -- with talk of an AI bubble on the verge of popping -- it might be wise to start positioning for a rotation out of the market's most-loved technology darlings and into something more traditionally blue chippy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average would be a great place to start that search.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nHere's a closer look at three Dow stocks that could soar in 2026, and then keep soaring after that.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Walmart\n\nIt seems strange to suggest Walmart(NYSE: WMT) shares are capable of soaring. Although the stock certainly has its bullish moments, there's still only so much growth that can be achieved by selling basic consumer goods through a network of brick-and-mortar retail stores. And to be fair, Walmart's version of soaring isn't quite what it would be with names like Nvidia or IonQ.\n\nStill, given the relatively less risk and volatility Walmart brings to the table, this stock should perform surprisingly well in the year ahead for a couple of reasons.\n\nOne of those reasons was just underscored with the release of the company's fiscal third-quarter numbers. Revenue grew 5.8% year over year to $179.5 billion versus expectations of $177.4 billion for Q3 of fiscal year 2026, which ended Oct. 31, 2025. Adjusted earnings of $0.62 per share topped estimates of $0.60. Same-store sales within the United States (where Walmart does about two-thirds of its business) improved by 4.5% versus a tough year-earlier comparison of 5.3%.\n\nWere it just this one quarter it might be chalked up as a stroke of luck. It's not just this one quarter, though. This sort of growth and outperformance has been the norm for the better part of the past few years. It's a sign that the retailer's pricing, positioning, and perks are all resonating with consumers of all income demographics. Other similar retailers can't claim the same.\n\nAs for the other reason Walmart shares are set to rally in 2026 and beyond, despite the company's persistently impressive performance of late, the stock hasn't exactly reflected this. Even with the recent post-earnings leap shares are still only barely above their February peak. There's plenty of room to tack on more gains from here.\n\n2. Boeing\n\nIt's been downright agonizing to be a Boeing(NYSE: BA) shareholder since 2019. Just when it looks like the company's finally going to shake off all the misery that its new (and lauded) 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner jets have caused, a new problem seems to surface, upending the stock. Shares are currently trading right about where they were in the middle of 2017, in fact. Consistent net losses during this stretch certainly haven't helped either.\n\nThe funny thing is, despite all the company's plane-design woes, airlines continue to order more and more of them. As of the end of the third quarter Boeing's production backlog stood at record-breaking $635 billion worth of orders.\n\nData source: The Boeing Co. Chart by author.\n\nMost of these orders can be canceled, for the record. But most of them won't be, given that the average age of jetliners still in active use today is just under a record-breaking 15 years (according to the International Air Transport Association). More and more of these planes are going to need to be replaced in the foreseeable future. Indeed, Boeing expects the airline industry to take delivery of 43,600 new planes between now and 2044 just to keep up with the growing demand for air travel. For perspective, there are only a little more than 27,000 jetliners currently in airlines' active fleets.\n\nThe year ahead may be the year the industry as well as investors are finally forced to connect these dots and start pricing this bigger picture into Boeing's shares.\n\n3. Apple\n\nFinally, add Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of Dow stocks that could soar in 2026 and beyond.\n\nIt's not been a bad performer this year. In fact, Apple shares recently hit a record high.\n\nThere's no denying, however, the stock's been held back by the company's botched entry into the consumer-facing artificial intelligence (AI) space; Apple Intelligence just wasn't ready for deployment when it became available in October last year. Neither was the updated version of its AI-powered digital assistant Siri.\n\nDisappointing AI software, of course, negates the need for Apple's newest AI-capable hardware than can use it, which is why iPhone revenue only improved about 4% over the course of the past four reported quarters.\n\nOne has to assume, however, the company's going to make sure it gets it right the next time around, particularly with the rerelease of an updated Siri slated for sometime early in the coming year. This will also give consumers more time to warm up to the idea of onboard artificial intelligence tools, as well as give the company a chance to develop and introduce a cheaper version of the AI-capable iPhone 17 that launched in September.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone owners' devices continue to age, moving them closer to an eventual upgrade. UBS reported in March that the average age of an iPhone outside of China was a sky-high 37 months, pushing the limit of how long these customers will postpone the purchase of a new one.\n\nIn other words, several bullish forces are likely to converge in 2026.\n\nThe only matter that might give you pause here is the stock's recent run-up. We may be due for a small pullback, particularly if most other AI technology stocks take a corrective tumble. That could drag AAPL shares lower, too.\n\nJust don't get be too stingy. When Apple's firing on all cylinders, the stock doesn't remain on sale for too long.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walmart wasn\u2019t one of them.

So really, $1M in retirement is gonna get you that fairly safely. $1.5M isn\u2019t exactly overkill.\u201d\n\nSeveral echoed that sentiment, emphasizing that she may be over-saving.

Certainly understand the financial advisor's point of wanting to make sure you're enjoying life now.\u201d\n\nStill, many pushed back on her view that she doesn't want to own a home due to rising property taxes in retirement. \u201cYou'll have increasing rent,\u201d one commenter pointed out, while another said that rent will increase much faster than property taxes.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOthers said owning a home can be part of a long-term retirement plan. \u201cIf OP takes out a 30-year mortgage right now and only follows the payment schedule, she would be basically paid off by retirement,\u201d one person said.\n\nSee Also: Bill Gates Says Climate Change \u2018Needs to Be Solved' \u2014 This Award-Winning Building Material Is Tackling It Head-On\n\nMore broadly, the thread turned into a discussion on quality of life and balance. \u201cDon\u2019t put off absolutely everything,\u201d one commenter warned, sharing her breast cancer diagnosis at 44 and regrets about not spending more earlier.

Another wrote, \u201cThe earlier you start saving for retirement, the easier it will be to actually retire, due to compounding growth.\u201d\n\nSome found a middle ground, advising her to reallocate a small portion of her retirement contributions into a taxable brokerage account. \u201cMaybe just budget in an extra trip every year?\u201d one commenter suggested. \u201cI think you're doing great!\u201d\n\nIn the end, the advice she received from Reddit was that if she\u2019s comfortable with her lifestyle now, there's no harm in continuing what she's doing.

Alphabet is winning in both consumer and infrastructure artificial intelligence (AI).  Microsoft's AI infrastructure revenue is growing at an impressive clip. 10 stocks we like better than Apple \u203a\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has done well this year, and it currently sports a $4 trillion market cap, making it the second-largest company in the world behind Nvidia ($4.4 trillion). Investors love the company behind the iPhone, iPad, and the entire Apple computing ecosystem that generates over $400 billion in revenue each year.\n\nHowever, if we look at the underlying earnings and growth of the business, it is clear that Apple stock is overvalued versus other \"Magnificent Seven\" companies. Here's the skinny on why Apple stock will be eclipsed by Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), with its $3.64 billion market cap, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), with its $3.53 trillion market cap, by year-end 2026 when it comes to total value.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nAlphabet's extending lead in AI\n\nAlphabet -- the parent company behind Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud -- recently set a new bar in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with the launch of the Gemini 3 chatbot. Gemini 3 crushes the benchmarks in AI capabilities across language queries, image generation, and deep research. Even though OpenAI's ChatGPT has more users, Gemini is the best chatbot out there today, according to third-party analysts.\n\nGemini is now powering AI overviews on Google search results, which management says already has 2 billion users every month. The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly active users (MAUs), making it one of the fastest-growing applications in the world, catching up to ChatGPT quickly. What's more, 70% of Google Cloud customers are utilizing Gemini, with 13 million developers building on the models. Not only can Alphabet monetize its AI capabilities through consumers, but by selling its capabilities through Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue is growing 34% year over year, and while we don't have figures around Gemini's revenue growth, it is likely growing much faster. Overall, Alphabet revenue is now growing 15% in constant currency, and with healthy profit margins. With no end in sight to the growing demand for AI, I expect Alphabet's revenue to keep growing at a double-digit rate over the next few years.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDiversified bets on AI infrastructure\n\nWhile Microsoft has lagged in developing consumer chatbots, it has perhaps been even better than Google Cloud at capturing AI contracts for its cloud computing division, Microsoft Azure.\n\nAzure has signed deals with AI start-ups competing with Google's Gemini, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, which come with huge sums of projected lifetime spending. For example, just this week, Anthropic cozied up to Azure and committed to buying $30 billion in credits on Azure. Last quarter, Azure revenue grew 39% year over year in constant currency, with overall cloud revenue up 27% to $30.9 billion, or run-rate revenues of $123.6 billion.\n\nMicrosoft has plenty going for it with its Office suite of products, too. This revenue segment, which also includes LinkedIn, grew revenue 14% year over year last quarter to $33 billion. At such a large scale, Microsoft is now seeing huge amounts of operating leverage, with operating income of $38 billion last quarter on $77.7 billion in revenue, or a margin of 49%.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nWhy both stocks will be worth more than Apple\n\nWhen comparing both Microsoft and Alphabet to Apple, there are two metrics that show why the former stocks are better positioned than the latter to be larger in 2026: growth and price.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet have grown much faster than Apple in recent history. Over the last three years, Microsoft's revenue has grown 44% and Alphabet's has grown 37% (cumulatively). Apple's is only up 7.4%.\n\nApple has failed to innovate and bring out successful new products, especially in the AI space, that can drive growth for the business. In fact, it is rumored that the struggling Siri chatbot will be utilizing Gemini in the future, which Apple will be paying Alphabet $1 billion a year for the privilege of.\n\nApple stock is also priced higher than Microsoft and Alphabet. Apple has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 compared to 34.5 for Microsoft and 29 for Alphabet. So not only is Apple growing slower than its Magnificent Seven peers, but doing so while trading at a higher valuation. I bet this paradigm flips in 2026, leading Microsoft and Alphabet to finish the year with larger market caps than Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Alphabet is winning in both consumer and infrastructure artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft's AI infrastructure revenue is growing at an impressive clip. 10 stocks we like better than Apple \u203a\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has done well this year, and it currently sports a $4 trillion market cap, making it the second-largest company in the world behind Nvidia ($4.4 trillion). Investors love the company behind the iPhone, iPad, and the entire Apple computing ecosystem that generates over $400 billion in revenue each year.\n\nHowever, if we look at the underlying earnings and growth of the business, it is clear that Apple stock is overvalued versus other \"Magnificent Seven\" companies. Here's the skinny on why Apple stock will be eclipsed by Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), with its $3.64 billion market cap, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), with its $3.53 trillion market cap, by year-end 2026 when it comes to total value.\n\nAlphabet's extending lead in AI\n\nAlphabet -- the parent company behind Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud -- recently set a new bar in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with the launch of the Gemini 3 chatbot. Gemini 3 crushes the benchmarks in AI capabilities across language queries, image generation, and deep research. Even though OpenAI's ChatGPT has more users, Gemini is the best chatbot out there today, according to third-party analysts.\n\nGemini is now powering AI overviews on Google search results, which management says already has 2 billion users every month. The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly active users (MAUs), making it one of the fastest-growing applications in the world, catching up to ChatGPT quickly. What's more, 70% of Google Cloud customers are utilizing Gemini, with 13 million developers building on the models. Not only can Alphabet monetize its AI capabilities through consumers, but by selling its capabilities through Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue is growing 34% year over year, and while we don't have figures around Gemini's revenue growth, it is likely growing much faster. Overall, Alphabet revenue is now growing 15% in constant currency, and with healthy profit margins. With no end in sight to the growing demand for AI, I expect Alphabet's revenue to keep growing at a double-digit rate over the next few years.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDiversified bets on AI infrastructure\n\nWhile Microsoft has lagged in developing consumer chatbots, it has perhaps been even better than Google Cloud at capturing AI contracts for its cloud computing division, Microsoft Azure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAzure has signed deals with AI start-ups competing with Google's Gemini, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, which come with huge sums of projected lifetime spending. For example, just this week, Anthropic cozied up to Azure and committed to buying $30 billion in credits on Azure. Last quarter, Azure revenue grew 39% year over year in constant currency, with overall cloud revenue up 27% to $30.9 billion, or run-rate revenues of $123.6 billion.\n\nMicrosoft has plenty going for it with its Office suite of products, too. This revenue segment, which also includes LinkedIn, grew revenue 14% year over year last quarter to $33 billion. At such a large scale, Microsoft is now seeing huge amounts of operating leverage, with operating income of $38 billion last quarter on $77.7 billion in revenue, or a margin of 49%.Data by YCharts.\n\nWhy both stocks will be worth more than Apple\n\nWhen comparing both Microsoft and Alphabet to Apple, there are two metrics that show why the former stocks are better positioned than the latter to be larger in 2026: growth and price.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet have grown much faster than Apple in recent history. Over the last three years, Microsoft's revenue has grown 44% and Alphabet's has grown 37% (cumulatively). Apple's is only up 7.4%.\n\nApple has failed to innovate and bring out successful new products, especially in the AI space, that can drive growth for the business. In fact, it is rumored that the struggling Siri chatbot will be utilizing Gemini in the future, which Apple will be paying Alphabet $1 billion a year for the privilege of.\n\nApple stock is also priced higher than Microsoft and Alphabet. Apple has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 compared to 34.5 for Microsoft and 29 for Alphabet. So not only is Apple growing slower than its Magnificent Seven peers, but doing so while trading at a higher valuation. I bet this paradigm flips in 2026, leading Microsoft and Alphabet to finish the year with larger market caps than Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Consumers in the U.S. are struggling. The company's valuation looks attractive. 10 stocks we like better than Lululemon Athletica Inc. \u203a\n\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) has been one of the best-performing apparel stocks on the market over this century. Since its 2007 IPO, the stock, which is best known for pioneering the athleisure category, has jumped 1,090%. Those gains were much more impressive before the stock tumbled this year, though.\n\nYear-to-date through Nov. 19, the stock was down 57%, making it one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) this year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nLike other apparel companies and much of the discretionary goods sector, including Deckers, Nike, Target, and Chipotle, Lululemon is seeing a pullback in demand as sales in its core North American market have essentially flatlined. In the second quarter, comparable sales fell 4% in the Americas, and revenue in the region was up just 1%.\n\nIn addition to the macroeconomic headwinds, management also acknowledged its own lack of execution as it failed to keep product fresh and in stock in specific categories, leading to weaker sales.\n\nIt was also forced to slash its guidance for the year due to the loss of the de minimis exemption, which had allowed shipments of less than $800 to be imported into the U.S. without paying tariffs.\n\nAs a result of those setbacks, the stock has dropped sharply, but is this a buying opportunity or a sign of things to come? Let's take a look at three things you should know before buying Lululemon stock.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Management is changing strategy\n\nCEO Calvin McDonald acknowledged the challenges the company is facing, as well as its own errors. He said, \"Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests,\" and that the company relied on the same product playbook in certain categories for too long.\n\nIn order to fix these problems, the company plans to speed up its go-to-market process to test new styles, increasing the number and frequency of new styles. Specifically, it's aiming to increase the percentage of new styles in its assortment from 23% to 35% by next spring, and will measure customer behavior to the change and respond accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, the company has improved its fast-track design capabilities, reducing lead times by several months for some products, and expects those to begin to have an impact starting early next year.\n\nIt's too soon to say if that's enough to turn Lululemon's performance, but investors should be encouraged by management's diagnosis and its quick action.\n\n2. International growth is still strong\n\nWhile Lululemon is clearly struggling in its core market, it is finding success elsewhere. In its international segment, comparable sales rose 15%, driving revenue up 22%. Its performance was particularly strong in China, which has become its second-largest market outside of North America.\n\nComparable sales in China jumped 17% in the second quarter, and revenue rose 25%.\n\nLululemon has followed in the footsteps of other Western brands, including Nike, Apple, and Starbucks, that have had success in a market known for conspicuous consumption, and it sees a long runway of growth in China.\n\nIt opened five new stores in China in the second quarter, and more than half of its international store openings this year will be in China. It is also a promising opportunity in Mexico, where Lululemon has opened 18 locations over the last four quarters.\n\n3. The valuation is attractive\n\nFollowing the sell-off this year, Lululemon's price-to-earnings valuation is the lowest it's ever been, with the possible exception of the great financial crisis, as it now trades at a P/E of just 11.3.\n\nThat's a valuation that indicates that investors expect the stock to only have low-single-digit growth from here on out. However, despite its recent struggles, Lululemon is still very much a growth company, opening new stores both in North America and abroad, and benefiting from the continuing growth of the category it invented, athleisure.\n\nIt's possible that the consumer slump could weaken and send Lululemon stock even lower, but it looks more likely than not that the apparel retailer will come out of the other side a stronger, faster-growing company, especially if its style refresh pays off.\n\nInvestors have an opportunity to get a piece of the growth stock for a bargain price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica Inc. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica Inc., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lululemon Athletica Inc. wasn\u2019t one of them.

Consumers in the U.S. are struggling. The company's valuation looks attractive. 10 stocks we like better than Lululemon Athletica Inc. \u203a\n\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) has been one of the best-performing apparel stocks on the market over this century. Since its 2007 IPO, the stock, which is best known for pioneering the athleisure category, has jumped 1,090%. Those gains were much more impressive before the stock tumbled this year, though.\n\nYear-to-date through Nov. 19, the stock was down 57%, making it one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) this year.\n\nLike other apparel companies and much of the discretionary goods sector, including Deckers, Nike, Target, and Chipotle, Lululemon is seeing a pullback in demand as sales in its core North American market have essentially flatlined. In the second quarter, comparable sales fell 4% in the Americas, and revenue in the region was up just 1%.\n\nIn addition to the macroeconomic headwinds, management also acknowledged its own lack of execution as it failed to keep product fresh and in stock in specific categories, leading to weaker sales.\n\nIt was also forced to slash its guidance for the year due to the loss of the de minimis exemption, which had allowed shipments of less than $800 to be imported into the U.S. without paying tariffs.\n\nAs a result of those setbacks, the stock has dropped sharply, but is this a buying opportunity or a sign of things to come? Let's take a look at three things you should know before buying Lululemon stock.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Management is changing strategy\n\nCEO Calvin McDonald acknowledged the challenges the company is facing, as well as its own errors. He said, \"Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests,\" and that the company relied on the same product playbook in certain categories for too long.\n\nIn order to fix these problems, the company plans to speed up its go-to-market process to test new styles, increasing the number and frequency of new styles. Specifically, it's aiming to increase the percentage of new styles in its assortment from 23% to 35% by next spring, and will measure customer behavior to the change and respond accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, the company has improved its fast-track design capabilities, reducing lead times by several months for some products, and expects those to begin to have an impact starting early next year.\n\nIt's too soon to say if that's enough to turn Lululemon's performance, but investors should be encouraged by management's diagnosis and its quick action.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. International growth is still strong\n\nWhile Lululemon is clearly struggling in its core market, it is finding success elsewhere. In its international segment, comparable sales rose 15%, driving revenue up 22%. Its performance was particularly strong in China, which has become its second-largest market outside of North America.\n\nComparable sales in China jumped 17% in the second quarter, and revenue rose 25%.\n\nLululemon has followed in the footsteps of other Western brands, including Nike, Apple, and Starbucks, that have had success in a market known for conspicuous consumption, and it sees a long runway of growth in China.\n\nIt opened five new stores in China in the second quarter, and more than half of its international store openings this year will be in China. It is also a promising opportunity in Mexico, where Lululemon has opened 18 locations over the last four quarters.\n\n3. The valuation is attractive\n\nFollowing the sell-off this year, Lululemon's price-to-earnings valuation is the lowest it's ever been, with the possible exception of the great financial crisis, as it now trades at a P/E of just 11.3.\n\nThat's a valuation that indicates that investors expect the stock to only have low-single-digit growth from here on out. However, despite its recent struggles, Lululemon is still very much a growth company, opening new stores both in North America and abroad, and benefiting from the continuing growth of the category it invented, athleisure.\n\nIt's possible that the consumer slump could weaken and send Lululemon stock even lower, but it looks more likely than not that the apparel retailer will come out of the other side a stronger, faster-growing company, especially if its style refresh pays off.\n\nInvestors have an opportunity to get a piece of the growth stock for a bargain price.\n\nShould you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica Inc. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica Inc., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lululemon Athletica Inc. wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook is likely to retain his position until at least mid-2026, a claim that contradicts earlier reports.\n\nWhat Happened: The Financial Times had earlier reported this month that Apple was gearing up for Cook\u2019s departure\u00a0\u201cas soon as next year.\u201d\n\nThis report had triggered speculations about a potential leadership transition ahead of Apple\u2019s annual events.\n\nHowever,\u00a0Gurman, \u00a0in his\u00a0latest\u00a0\"Power On\u201d report, refuted this claim. Gurman expressed that\u00a0he would be \u201cshocked\u201d if\u00a0Cook were to step\u00a0down between late January and\u00a0June next year.\n\n\u201cBased on everything I've learned in recent weeks, I don't believe a departure by the middle of next year is likely. In fact, I would be shocked if Cook steps down in the time frame outlined by the FT,\u201d Gurman wrote.\n\n\u201cSome people have speculated that the story was a \"test balloon\" orchestrated by Apple or someone close to Cook to prepare Wall Street for a change, but that isn't the case either. I believe the story was simply false,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cTim Cook won't be CEO forever, but a report on his imminent departure was premature.\u00a0Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook turned 65 this month and is one of the longest-tenured CEOs in Silicon Valley. There will be a day when the company announces a CEO transition, and we're far closer to the end of Cook's tenure than we are from the beginning,\u201d he further shared.\n\nAlso Read: Apple Announces Major Changes: New iPhone Models and Altered Release Schedule\n\nGurman also noted that there\u00a0have been \u201cfew signs internally\u201d\u00a0that Cook is planning to step down. He further mentioned that John Ternus,\n\nApple\u2019s Senior Vice President of\u00a0Hardware Engineering, is considered as the most likely successor to Cook whenever the transition occurs.\n\nWhy It Matters: The speculation about Cook\u2019s departure had raised concerns about the future leadership of Apple, a company that has seen tremendous growth under Cook\u2019s stewardship.\n\nGurman\u2019s prediction, if accurate, would mean that Cook will continue to guide Apple\u2019s strategic direction for the next few years, potentially leading to further growth and innovation.\n\nThe mention of John Ternus as a potential successor also provides some insight into Apple\u2019s succession planning, which is crucial for the company\u2019s long-term stability and success.\n\nRead Next\n\nApple's Satellite-Powered Features for iPhones: A Journey Spanning Over A Decade\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

That reaction is usually blamed on tight budgets, but new research shows even households earning $200,000 a year are dodging their banking apps because the numbers on the screen feel stressful, not soothing.\n\nAccording to new research from The Harris Poll, 40% of six-figure earners say they have avoided checking their account balance to reduce stress, and that share jumps to 42% among those earning $200,000 or more. Nearly half of people in this group also say they struggle with financial anxiety, and a majority feel guilty complaining about money at all because they know they earn more than most.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse \u2014 Just $0.86 a Share Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate\u2014Get Institutional Access Yourself\n\nThe \"Income Paradox Survey\" was run online in the U.S. between July 31 and Aug. 2. It captured 2,109 adults nationwide, including 728 people with personal incomes of at least $100,000 and 280 who earn $200,000 or more, roughly the top 10% of individual income earners. So the people saying they are stressed are not the outliers at the very bottom of the six-figure pack.\n\nThe top-line numbers explain why opening a banking app has turned into a jump scare. Six figures now looks more like survival than success. Harris finds 64% of six-figure earners agree that six figures is \"survival mode, not a sign of wealth,\" and 52% say that even at this level, the American Dream is not possible for them. About 1 in 3 describe themselves as financially distressed, meaning they feel stretched, struggling or drowning with their finances.\n\nThe money is not being blown on designer handbags or mansions. It is going to the same categories that challenge everyone else, just with bigger price tags. When Harris asked what is draining income the most right now, six-figure earners pointed first to grocery and household essentials at 36%, followed by rent or mortgage payments at 32%, and health insurance or medical costs at 31%. Unexpected emergencies and transportation costs round out the top five, both at around 30%.\n\nTrending: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nThose basics leave little room for comfort spending. More than half of six-figure earners say things like regular vacations, driving a new car, or dining out regularly fall into a financial \"pressure zone\" where they either stretch to cover the cost or actively avoid it to stay stable. It is a quiet reset of what used to count as middle-class life.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nTo bridge the gap, many high earners lean on workarounds that used to be associated with people making far less. Three-quarters of six-figure earners have put everyday bills on a credit card in the past three months because they ran out of cash, not to chase rewards. That rises to 80% among those earning $200,000 or more. Nearly half of the $200,000 group say they rely on credit cards to make ends meet, and 45% say buy now, pay later has become a regular part of how they spend their money.\n\nThe coping strategies go beyond plastic. Among six-figure earners, 61% are either already working a side hustle or planning to, and sizable shares report selling personal items, cutting back on medical care, or even skipping meals to keep up with expenses. In the same survey, 62% say it feels nearly impossible to keep up with expenses on one income.\n\nRising prices have not helped. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that consumer prices have climbed roughly 23% since 2019, which means a paycheck that once covered a comfortable lifestyle now has to stretch much farther just to stand still. For households whose costs are concentrated in housing, healthcare, childcare and debt, those inflation years are still echoing.\n\nSee Also: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\n\nThat leads to the real question: how much would it take for these high earners to finally feel secure instead of stressed every time they glance at a balance.\n\nHarris asked that directly. Half of six-figure earners say a household needs at least $200,000 a year to feel comfortably middle class where they live. Among those already earning $200,000 or more, 75% say the same. Even more striking, 53% of six-figure earners say they would not feel financially secure unless they earned double what they make now, a view that is shared by 53% of the $200,000 group and 55% of all Americans.\n\nIn other words, plenty of people already earning $200,000 think they would only breathe easy closer to $400,000. Six-figure salaries were once the finish line. In this survey they look more like mile markers on a moving track, where even the people near the front are still glancing over their shoulders, hoping the next notification is not another bill.\n\nFor anyone in that camp, talking with a financial advisor can take some of the drama out of those numbers. A good advisor can help high earners sort out where the money is actually going, build a plan for debt, saving and investing, and pressure-test what \"secure\" really looks like for their household. It won't fix rising prices or rewrite a paycheck, but it can turn vague dread into a clearer map, which is often the first step toward feeling less anxious every time the banking app lights up.\n\nRead Next: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets \u2014 Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

The tech giant's high-margin services business now represents a substantial portion of total profits. Strong guidance and an emerging AI hardware upgrade story help explain why the stock trades at such a high valuation. 10 stocks we like better than Apple \u203a\n\nAfter a sharp rally in recent months, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares look expensive. The iPhone maker's stock has climbed to fresh highs, reflecting investors' growing confidence that the company has emerged from its growth lull and is heading into a stronger product and earnings cycle.\n\nApple is still a hardware-focused business, but the story now leans more on services and the steady influence of its installed base. That shift, together with a clearer artificial intelligence road map, helps explain why the stock still carries a premium valuation.iPhone 17 Pro Max. Image source: Apple.\n\n1. Growth is back on track\n\nAfter a sluggish stretch last year, Apple's revenue has begun to reaccelerate. Revenue grew 4%, 5%, 0%, and then 8% year over year across the four quarters of fiscal 2025 (respectively), lifting full-year growth to more than 6% from just 2% growth in fiscal 2024.\n\nImportantly, this accelerated growth was driven by both hardware and services revenue.\n\n2. A powerful iPhone 17 cycle\n\nThe current iPhone 17 cycle is a key driver of that rebound. iPhone revenue grew double digits year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and increased again in the fourth quarter as the new iPhone 17 lineup launched. Of course, the new iPhone models were available only for a few weeks during the fiscal fourth quarter. So, the real test will be during the important holiday period, which aligns with Apple's first quarter of fiscal 2026 (the current quarter).\n\nBut based on management's comments on the latest iPhone models in the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, we already know the iPhone 17 is probably going to do well this holiday season.\u00a0\"We're constrained today on several models of the iPhone 17,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook in the company's latest earnings call. \"There's not a ramp issue. It's just we have very strong demand and we're working very hard to fulfill all the orders that we have.\"\n\nIn addition, management specifically guided for double-digit year-over-year growth in iPhone revenue for the period.\n\n3. Services tilt the business toward higher margins\n\nApple's important services business, which is home to the App Store, Apple's native apps like Apple Music and Apple TV, and other services such as AppleCare, continues to grow faster than the rest of the company and carries a much higher gross margin than hardware sales. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, services revenue grew 15% year over year, compared with 8% for the company as a whole. In addition, the important segment represented close to 30% of total revenue during the quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThat shift toward recurring revenue sources in Apple's services business, including app store fees, cloud storage, payments, advertising, and subscriptions, should make Apple's business more resilient and -- importantly -- more profitable. After all, Apple's services business commands a gross margin of about twice that of the company's hardware business.\n\n4. Guidance signals more momentum\n\nManagement's outlook adds another pillar to the bullish case. For the current quarter ending in December, Apple expects total revenue to grow 10% to 12% year over year, and iPhone revenue to grow at a double-digit rate.\n\nViewing this guidance in light of the company's recent acceleration in the back half of fiscal 2025, that guidance suggests the current momentum is not just a one-quarter blip tied to product timing but something more sustainable.\n\n5. AI as a future catalyst\n\nThe final reason many investors remain comfortable owning Apple at a premium multiple is the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to drive another hardware upgrade cycle. Apple has talked more openly this year about integrating AI across devices, from on-device models that power smarter photo and messaging features to a revamped Siri expected in 2026.\n\nThe company has begun to ramp up capital spending and AI-related research and development. If AI features start to require more powerful devices better suited for fast-changing computing needs, Apple is positioned to capture that demand through new products in existing product lines and potentially even entirely new product lines enabled by AI.\n\nTaken together, these five pillars help explain why the market is willing to pay a rich price for Apple shares and why I personally remain bullish on the stock over the long haul.\n\nTrading at around 32 times forward earnings,\u00a0the stock isn't cheap, and any unexpected setbacks in iPhone demand or services growth could pressure that multiple -- especially if AI initiatives disappoint. Still, I believe the upside opportunity outweighs the risks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Amazon Web Services generates gobs of free cash flow that funds the company's other ambitions. Alphabet and Microsoft each generate sizable earnings from a variety of digital segments, including cloud computing infrastructure, where they're both major players. Meta Platforms has its highly profitable \"family of apps\" segment, which brings in more than enough to support its billions of dollars in losses from Reality Labs, which contains its metaverse-related operations. And Nvidia's compute and networking segment continues to deliver jaw-dropping results, while its smaller segments are also highly profitable.\n\nBy contrast, Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) deliveries were trending downward in the first half of 2025, though it remains the market leader. Its energy storage business is on firmer footing, but it makes up a small part of the top line. In the third quarter, Tesla grew automotive revenue just 6% year over year as deliveries rebounded, up 7%. However, the company's operating margin fell to just 5.8% -- a steep decline from 10.8% a year earlier.\n\nTesla is spending a ton of money on artificial intelligence and robotics, but it has yet to see a payoff from those investments.\n\nThis past summer, Tesla launched its autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and it has since expanded it to a few other markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area. However, it remains to be seen how profitable it will be at scale.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, so far, that service is being provided by standard Model Y EVs that have been outfitted with Tesla's Robotaxi technology, not the much-discussed Cybercab, which is not yet in production. And in most markets, regulators are still requiring human monitors for those autonomous vehicles.\n\nThere are better buys than Tesla for 2026\n\nTesla's Robotaxis feature pioneering-edge AI, which presents distinct challenges compared to embedding AI within smartphones or personal computers, so the company deserves credit for making progress in that field.\n\nHowever, the risks of investing in Tesla simply aren't worth the potential rewards at this time, especially given the fact the stock is trading at 178 times expected 2026 earnings.\n\nSince Tesla's valuation appears to be increasingly disconnected from its core EV business and based more on the potential of new ventures that have yet to prove themselves, investors may want to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the stock at this time. There are many other compelling buys in big tech.\n\nStay tuned to find out how the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks stack up in my rankings for 2026.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, the company's operating margin fell to just 5.8% -- a steep decline from 10.8% a year earlier.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTesla is spending a ton of money on artificial intelligence and robotics, but it has yet to see a payoff from those investments.\n\nThis past summer, Tesla launched its autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and it has since expanded it to a few other markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area. However, it remains to be seen how profitable it will be at scale.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, so far, that service is being provided by standard Model Y EVs that have been outfitted with Tesla's Robotaxi technology, not the much-discussed Cybercab, which is not yet in production. And in most markets, regulators are still requiring human monitors for those autonomous vehicles.\n\nThere are better buys than Tesla for 2026\n\nTesla's Robotaxis feature pioneering-edge AI, which presents distinct challenges compared to embedding AI within smartphones or personal computers, so the company deserves credit for making progress in that field.\n\nHowever, the risks of investing in Tesla simply aren't worth the potential rewards at this time, especially given the fact the stock is trading at 178 times expected 2026 earnings.\n\nSince Tesla's valuation appears to be increasingly disconnected from its core EV business and based more on the potential of new ventures that have yet to prove themselves, investors may want to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the stock at this time. There are many other compelling buys in big tech.\n\nStay tuned to find out how the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks stack up in my rankings for 2026.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

See the stocks \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet isn't the corporation closest to the $5 trillion mark. Other than Nvidia, which has already achieved that milestone but is currently worth less than that, Microsoft and Apple are both ahead. The former has a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion, while the latter is valued at $3.9 trillion.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning Amazon, which is currently trailing at $2.4 trillion. However, it may be able to catch up, provided it gains significant market value while its peers decline over the next couple of years.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe Alphabet could perform at least as well as Amazon for the foreseeable future. Both are leaders in the cloud computing market. Amazon has a larger market share, but Alphabet is growing sales in that division more quickly.\n\nThe rest of their businesses put Alphabet squarely in the lead for one reason -- margins.\n\nAMZN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon generates higher sales, but Alphabet has higher profits and higher margins. Meanwhile, Alphabet still reigns supreme in search, despite challenges from artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.\n\nThe company has made changes to address this issue, including an AI overview and an AI mode within its renowned search engine. Furthermore, Alphabet eliminated a major risk this year and avoided the worst outcome -- that of losing its Chrome browser, a crucial part of its advertising empire -- in its antitrust lawsuit. In my view, Alphabet has enough momentum to stay ahead of Amazon in the next couple of years.\n\nWhat about Apple? Despite the iPhone maker's recent better-than-expected financial results, it's still facing significant threats.\n\nThe tariff situation is constantly evolving, and more news on that front could negatively impact Apple's stock price, as it still manufactures most of its products in China, a country President Trump has targeted with tariffs. Alphabet is also already cashing in on its AI strategy, whereas Apple has been lagging behind its similarly sized tech peers.\n\nAlphabet's AI offerings through its cloud division, including its AI overviews and AI mode, as well as algorithms that increase engagement on YouTube -- leading to higher ad revenue -- are all important tailwinds for the company. So Alphabet could perform much better than Apple and beat the iPhone maker to a $5 trillion valuation.\n\nWhat about Microsoft? Both companies are thriving in the cloud and AI spaces. Microsoft arguably has an edge over Alphabet in both. However, Alphabet appears more reasonably valued when considering traditional valuation metrics.\n\nGOOG Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nThat's one reason Alphabet could overtake even Microsoft to become the next $5 trillion company.\n\nThe more important question\n\nOf course, outcomes are always hard to predict. A lot could happen in the next 12 months (or so) that would disrupt Alphabet's path to a $5 trillion market cap, and one of its peers could get there before.\n\nWill Alphabet perform well enough in the next couple of years to be the next company to reach this goal? That's less important than determining whether the stock is worth holding for long-term investors, regardless of what happens in the short term. In that department, Alphabet looks like a great pick. It's a leader in several industries, boasting massive growth prospects in digital advertising, cloud computing, AI, and streaming.\n\nThe tech giant also has a hand in innovative and potentially disruptive new sectors, such as self-driving vehicles. Further, Alphabet benefits from a strong competitive advantage, thanks to its brand name, switching costs in cloud computing, and network effects in internet search.\n\nAfter eliminating a major antitrust threat, the company's prospects look stronger than ever. All things considered, Alphabet appears to be a buy, even if it doesn't become the next $5 trillion company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $562,536!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,096,510!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 981% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 187% for the S&P 500.

It means spending on the scheme is now almost double what it was before the pandemic, when the bill totalled \u00a3154m.\n\nAnyone, regardless of income, who has a mental, neurological or physical health condition can apply for support through Access to Work, provided they are in work or have a job interview.\n\nTwo in five claimants (38pc) listed mental health as their primary condition, followed by 11pc reporting a learning disability, the DWP figures showed.\n\nThe figures are likely to increase pressure on Rachel Reeves after a Labour backbench rebellion forced her to cancel a raft of cuts to welfare spending.\n\nApplications for Access to Work support can be filled out in as little as 20 minutes and the Government\u2019s application guidance states that claimants do not need to be diagnosed with a condition to apply.\n\nMinisters are understood to be alarmed by the increasing demand for the support, and the Government is currently reviewing the findings of a consultation into the future of the scheme.\n\nThe surging popularity of the scheme comes amid a rise in so-called sickfluencers highlighting the scheme to users on TikTok and Reddit, with one claimant with ADHD saying they were able to get half of the cost of an Apple Watch covered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still unsure how much value it\u2019s bringing to my day,\u201d the claimant wrote on Reddit.\n\nOne website describes the scheme as \u201cone of the UK Government\u2019s best-kept secrets\u201d.\n\nHealth-related benefit claims have surged since the pandemic, driven by mental ill health, autism, ADHD and musculoskeletal issues, with costs projected to hit \u00a3100bn by the end of the decade without reform.\n\nSome 74,190 people received a payment through Access to Work in the financial year to March 2025, the figures show. This marks a 10pc leap from 67,240 the year before.\n\nHowever, approvals fell for the first time since Covid.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt comes after reports that the Government has quietly cut funding for the scheme, with applications increasingly facing reductions on renewal.\n\nThe scheme, which was introduced in 1994 to make working life easier for disabled people, also funds support workers, therapy sessions and travel to work.\n\nJust under a quarter of approvals were for payments for special aids and equipment \u2013 ranging from fidget toys to white noise machines.\n\nThe DWP\u2019s figures show 75pc of claims were made by people in work, while 12pc were self-employed.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nBRK.B Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThese dynamics are beginning to shift. According to Berkshire's latest 13F filing, the investment firm bought 17.8 million shares of Alphabet during the third quarter -- a stake that is now worth about $4.3 billion. Notably, Alphabet was the only stock Berkshire purchased in the third quarter.\n\nLet's break down Buffett's investment philosophy and explore how Alphabet fits into that equation. From there, I'll take a look at Alphabet's valuation metrics to help determine if now is a good time to follow Buffett's lead.\n\nWhat types of stocks does Warren Buffett like to buy?\n\nIf you want to learn how to invest like Warren Buffett, you're in luck. While the Oracle of Omaha ranks among the world's wealthiest people, Buffett's approach to investing is quite simple.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio does not feature speculative companies involved in volatile industries. Instead, Buffett seeks out durability. Against this backdrop, it's not surprising that companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Chevron are some of Buffett's largest positions.\n\nEach of these is considered a blue chip company that produces steady, predictable cash flow. Moreover, these businesses often reinvest their profits into shareholder rewards programs such as dividends or stock buybacks.\n\nIn essence, Buffett pounces on businesses with best-in-class brand recognition that sell products that people need in their daily lives. Given these dynamics, many of the positions in Berkshire's portfolio could be seen as stocks that long-term investors can own forever.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAlphabet meets Buffett's checklist\n\nAlphabet checks off many of Buffett's boxes. The company owns two of the most recognizable brands on the planet: internet search platform Google and video-sharing website YouTube.\n\nGiven the level of internet surface area that Alphabet covers, it's obvious why advertisers are eager to capitalize on the engagement the company generates. This gives Alphabet enormous leverage in the form of pricing power, which directly translates into a steady, highly profitable operation.\n\nBeyond advertising, Alphabet has also built a thriving cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Underneath this umbrella sits a custom hardware offering, called tensor processing units (TPUs). Layering cloud software with custom silicon gives Alphabet a direct line into the semiconductor industry -- enabling it to take on incumbents like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nLastly, Alphabet also has a large consumer electronics business in Android -- which competes with Apple -- and is also taking on Tesla in the world of autonomous driving through its subsidiary, Waymo.\n\nAlphabet's diverse ecosystem provides the company with an enviable degree of flexibility -- a form of malleability that positions it to pivot and grow during virtually any economic cycle or emerging technology trend. In turn, the company is consistently profitable, which Alphabet uses to reinvest in innovation as well as reward shareholders through a modest dividend program.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA Buffett masterclass: Finding value in a sea of growth\n\nIn my view, it's unlikely that Buffett decided to initiate a position in Alphabet purely based on the AI narrative. Berkshire's portfolio has always featured a limited number of technology businesses.\n\nHowever, among the tech stocks that Buffett has chosen, a common theme arises. In addition to Apple, Berkshire also has positions in Amazon and now Alphabet. Each of these companies has built diversified ecosystems across software, hardware, and consumer services.\n\nGOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28, Alphabet stock is no longer trading at a bargain. While paying a premium is uncharacteristic of Buffett, Alphabet is still the second-cheapest stock among the Magnificent Seven -- suggesting investors may not be fully pricing in the company's next growth phase.\n\nIn my eyes, Buffett is still sticking to his playbook -- identifying relative value in an otherwise frothy market. Furthermore, I think the timing of Berkshire's purchase of Alphabet stock is telling. In other words, if Buffett and his constituents felt that AI was a fad or a bubble, then Berkshire would not have bought Alphabet stock.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, I think Alphabet remains an attractive opportunity given its proven durability and compelling long-term potential -- with or without AI playing a role in the thesis.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

From there, I'll take a look at Alphabet's valuation metrics to help determine if now is a good time to follow Buffett's lead.\n\nWhat types of stocks does Warren Buffett like to buy?\n\nIf you want to learn how to invest like Warren Buffett, you're in luck. While the Oracle of Omaha ranks among the world's wealthiest people, Buffett's approach to investing is quite simple.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio does not feature speculative companies involved in volatile industries. Instead, Buffett seeks out durability. Against this backdrop, it's not surprising that companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Chevron are some of Buffett's largest positions.\n\nEach of these is considered a blue chip company that produces steady, predictable cash flow. Moreover, these businesses often reinvest their profits into shareholder rewards programs such as dividends or stock buybacks.\n\nIn essence, Buffett pounces on businesses with best-in-class brand recognition that sell products that people need in their daily lives. Given these dynamics, many of the positions in Berkshire's portfolio could be seen as stocks that long-term investors can own forever.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAlphabet meets Buffett's checklist\n\nAlphabet checks off many of Buffett's boxes. The company owns two of the most recognizable brands on the planet: internet search platform Google and video-sharing website YouTube.\n\nGiven the level of internet surface area that Alphabet covers, it's obvious why advertisers are eager to capitalize on the engagement the company generates. This gives Alphabet enormous leverage in the form of pricing power, which directly translates into a steady, highly profitable operation.\n\nBeyond advertising, Alphabet has also built a thriving cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Underneath this umbrella sits a custom hardware offering, called tensor processing units (TPUs). Layering cloud software with custom silicon gives Alphabet a direct line into the semiconductor industry -- enabling it to take on incumbents like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nLastly, Alphabet also has a large consumer electronics business in Android -- which competes with Apple -- and is also taking on Tesla in the world of autonomous driving through its subsidiary, Waymo.\n\nAlphabet's diverse ecosystem provides the company with an enviable degree of flexibility -- a form of malleability that positions it to pivot and grow during virtually any economic cycle or emerging technology trend. In turn, the company is consistently profitable, which Alphabet uses to reinvest in innovation as well as reward shareholders through a modest dividend program.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA Buffett masterclass: Finding value in a sea of growth\n\nIn my view, it's unlikely that Buffett decided to initiate a position in Alphabet purely based on the AI narrative. Berkshire's portfolio has always featured a limited number of technology businesses.\n\nHowever, among the tech stocks that Buffett has chosen, a common theme arises. In addition to Apple, Berkshire also has positions in Amazon and now Alphabet. Each of these companies has built diversified ecosystems across software, hardware, and consumer services.GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28, Alphabet stock is no longer trading at a bargain. While paying a premium is uncharacteristic of Buffett, Alphabet is still the second-cheapest stock among the Magnificent Seven -- suggesting investors may not be fully pricing in the company's next growth phase.\n\nIn my eyes, Buffett is still sticking to his playbook -- identifying relative value in an otherwise frothy market. Furthermore, I think the timing of Berkshire's purchase of Alphabet stock is telling. In other words, if Buffett and his constituents felt that AI was a fad or a bubble, then Berkshire would not have bought Alphabet stock.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, I think Alphabet remains an attractive opportunity given its proven durability and compelling long-term potential -- with or without AI playing a role in the thesis.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

New Survey Finds Cash Is 'Cringe' And Leads To Frivolous Spending Among Gen Z", "content": "Parents today are navigating a financial world that looks nothing like the one they grew up with. And for many families, one question keeps coming up: When is the right time to give your teen a debit card?\n\nWith digital payments now the norm for young people, new research suggests that teens may actually learn better habits with a card in hand. But it also highlights some surprising tendencies around cash, spending, and savings that families may want to consider.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon \u2014 Invest at $0.86/Share An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace\u2014Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nGen Z Says Cash Encourages Overspending\n\nThere is a clear generational shift in attitudes toward physical money, according to Cash App's Gen-Z Financial Future survey. More than half of Gen Z respondents said they're more likely to spend impulsively when they have cash, and nearly a third see cash users as \"out of touch\" or even \"cringe.\" At the same time, 53% reported using cash only as a last resort.\n\nThese attitudes may be shaping how young people manage their money. Many Gen Z consumers are already using checking or savings accounts, but the survey found that savings levels remain low: about 46% reported having less than $500 saved. Limited awareness of interest rates may also be contributing \u2014 only 44% knew the rate on their savings account.\n\nWhy More Teens Are Using Debit Cards\n\nDebit cards are becoming a common tool for teens to build financial skills. Most major banks allow teens as young as 13 to open checking accounts with a parent or guardian as a co-signer, according to Bankrate. Parents often see debit cards as a controlled way to help their children practice budgeting while still maintaining oversight.\n\nTrending: Have $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone \u2014 don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nThe Cash App survey reinforces that idea. Parents of teens ages 13\u201317 reported that giving their teens access to a debit card or savings account has:\n\nIncreased their financial independence Encouraged more responsible spending Helped them build budgeting confidence\n\nThis suggests that early hands-on experience may help teens develop better long-term habits, especially when combined with parental guidance.\n\nTeens Want Tools That Reward Good Habits\n\nAnother major finding from the survey is that earning interest is a powerful motivator. Over three-quarters of Gen Z respondents said they'd save more if they were earning interest. In response, Cash App recently expanded its 3.5% APY savings feature to Sponsored Accounts for teens ages 13\u201317.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe survey also shows that teens aren't just saving for short-term purchases. About 46% are building funds for emergencies, 36% are preparing for major milestones like college or moving out, and 37% are saving for experiences like travel.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate\u2014Get Institutional Access Yourself\n\nSigns Your Teen May Be Ready\n\nWhile readiness varies by child, financial experts at Bankrate say parents should consider a few common indicators before setting up a debit card for their children:\n\nThey're earning money. A first job or side gig is often a natural time to start managing income. They're driving. A debit card can help teens cover gas or handle emergencies. They frequently ask for money. A debit card tied to an allowance or stipend can help them practice budgeting.\n\nBankrate also says that parental involvement \u2014 such as setting rules, reviewing transactions, and holding regular \"money check-ins\" \u2014 plays a big role in whether teens use debit cards responsibly.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDebit cards are increasingly becoming part of the financial learning curve for teens. The data suggests that Gen Z sees digital money as the norm, while cash may actually encourage more spontaneous spending.\n\nWith the right guardrails and ongoing conversations, a debit card can be a practical way to help teens build confidence, understand budgeting, and establish healthy money habits before adulthood.\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Current low-rate mortgages are causing a \"locked-in\" effect. Housing affordability remains a significant challenge, especially for first-time buyers. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nIt's a good question, and the fact that it resonates reveals a lot about the U.S. housing market and its prospects for recovery. Here's a look at why both matter, and what the housing market needs right now.\n\n3% mortgage rates?\n\nUnfortunately, it's unlikely to happen for a while. For an idea of what the markets think, or instead, the bond markets think, here's a look at long-term U.S. Treasury yields and the 30-year mortgage rate.\n\nMortgage rates tend to trade at higher yields to reflect the greater risk of lending to homeowners compared to lending to the U.S. Treasury. Interpolating the chart below, the 10-year Treasury yield will have to decrease to approximately 1.5%, on the most optimistic assumption, for 30-year mortgages to return to 3%.30 Year Mortgage Rate data by YCharts\n\nThat doesn't look likely anytime soon, according to another useful indicator of what the bond market is thinking about inflation. The 10-Year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) is a bond whose principal value is adjusted according to the inflation rate. It follows that we can subtract its yield from the 10-year Treasury yield to get the market's view on where inflation will be in 10 years. This is known as the 10-Year TIPS/Treasury Breakeven Rate.\n\nAs you can see below, the market is pricing in long-term inflation of 2.27%. Again, based on this, the usual spread to the 10-year yield, and another spread to the 30-year mortgage yield, it's tough to see 3% mortgage rates in the near future.10 Year TIPS/Treasury Breakeven Rate data by YCharts\n\nWhat about real mortgage rates?\n\nAnother way to look at matters is to look at real mortgage rates, in other words, adjusted for inflation. We can do this by comparing current mortgage rates to the break-even inflation rate (in this case, the 30-year break-even inflation rate). This is useful because it helps adjust mortgage rates for inflation. Whichever way you look at it, mortgage rates are unlikely to drop to 3% anytime soon.Data source: Freddie Mac, Federal Reserve. Chart by author.\n\nWhy the question matters so much\n\nThe fact that the question matters is, in itself, highly illuminating of current housing market dynamics. According to JPMorgan research, \"half of current U.S. mortgage borrowers are still enjoying sub-4% rates and about 80% are paying under 6%.\" These relatively low rates are creating a so-called \"locked-in\" effect, in which homeowners are reluctant to sell their properties because they know they will have to pay a higher rate given current mortgage rates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis reluctance to sell is buoying house prices and creating a pincer movement of rising housing prices and rising mortgage rates, which is reducing housing affordability, notably so for first-time buyers. The housing affordability index is the ratio of the median family income to the qualifying income necessary to obtain a mortgage on the median-priced home.\n\nTherefore, an index of 100 indicates that the average family has just enough income to meet the average mortgage, and a number below 100 indicates that they do not. As such, a lower housing affordability index means housing is less affordable for the average income earner.US First Time Buyer Housing Affordability Index data by YCharts\n\nJPMorgan estimates a 2.8 million shortage of housing units in the U.S., and the best solution to the problems of housing affordability and availability lies in a gradual reduction in rates and a concomitant rise in housing starts. That's happening, but at a slower pace than many had expected previously, and 3% mortgages aren't likely to be part of the mix for some time to come.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Its SkyMiles loyalty program \u2014 and its partnership with American Express \u2014 delivers some of the highest-margin recurring revenue in the airline sector, offering stability even when ticket revenue fluctuates.\n\nThe carrier also benefits from effective fuel-cost management, improved labor agreements and growing international travel demand. As global route networks normalize and fleet utilization improves, Delta is positioned to generate stronger cash flow. Ongoing investment in aircraft efficiency, digital upgrades and sustainability initiatives further supports long-term competitiveness.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBear Case\n\nDelta faces rising uncertainty from tariff increases on imported aircraft and parts. These added costs could significantly raise capital expenditures, strain margins and delay fleet modernization. Continued trade tensions also introduce risk around international demand and cross-border route economics.\n\nFuel price volatility and new labor contracts across pilots and cabin crew threaten cost stability. Slower global growth or recessionary conditions could weaken discretionary travel demand, reducing premium ticket revenue. Meanwhile, aggressive competition from both U.S. carriers and international airlines poses ongoing pricing and yield pressure.\n\nDAL Stock Price Prediction for 2025\n\nBullish: 58.75 Average: 55.68 Bearish: 52.04\n\nAccording to CoinCodex, 2025 is expected to bring modest movement within a stable channel as Delta contends with labor-cost inflation and the lingering effects of geopolitical tensions.\n\nDAL Stock Price Prediction for 2026\n\nBullish: 66.72 Average: 52.28 Bearish: 41.19\n\nForecast models widen significantly for 2026, signaling higher uncertainty. The broader range reflects the mixed impact of premium demand versus potential headwinds from elevated fuel prices, new labor agreements and competitive capacity increases.\n\nDAL Stock Price Prediction for 2030\n\nBullish: 95.38 Average: 74.62 Bearish: 58.81\n\nLong-term projections suggest meaningful upside for DAL, expecting the airline to benefit from a more efficient fleet, fully normalized international routes and continued growth in loyalty-program revenue. High-margin SkyMiles income may act as a shock absorber against the inherent volatility of fuel and labor costs.\n\nInvestment Considerations\n\nTariffs remain one of Delta's biggest strategic risks. Additional fees on foreign aircraft and components could elevate expenses and slow fleet upgrades. Shifting capex toward untaxed domestic options might also limit fleet modernization and restrict long-haul route expansion.\n\nEconomic downturns represent another key threat. Even though premium travel tends to be resilient, a sharp global slowdown could hit corporate travel budgets and weaken demand at the top of the fare pyramid \u2014 a core profit driver for Delta.\n\nInvestors should closely monitor the health of Delta's loyalty program, as it provides reliable cash flow that often offsets cyclical fluctuations in ticket revenue. At the same time, monitoring jet fuel hedging strategies and unit-cost trends will be essential for evaluating the airline's ability to maintain margin discipline.\n\nDelta's long-term outlook remains tied to its success in balancing premium-focused strategy with operational efficiency. If the airline manages to stabilize costs and grow its high-margin revenue streams, DAL could offer significant upside \u2014 but risks remain firmly in play as global competition and tariff uncertainty continue to evolve.\n\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market\n\nWhen evaluating any stock price forecast, it's wise to think about portfolio balance and not rely on a single company's trajectory. Markets shift quickly, and putting all of your capital into one sector or stock can increase risk. Many investors are turning to platforms that open the door to real estate, professional financial advice, fixed-income products, and even self-directed retirement options. These tools make it easier to diversify, smooth out volatility, and build wealth across multiple asset classes over time.\n\nArrived Homes\n\nBacked by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds\n\nFor those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial\n\nSelf-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto.

Professional money managers struggle to beat the S&P 500 on a consistent basis, as evidenced by a bet Buffett made in 2007. The S&P 500 returned 1,820% over the last three decades (10.3% annually), a pace that would turn $450 per month into $940,200.10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history, but some of his best advice is often overlooked by traders in search of the next great stock.\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting in 2021. Investors have several options, but Buffett himself selected the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) when going head-to-head with a hedge fund in the early 2000s.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nFollowing Buffett's advice could turn $450 per month into $940,200. Here's what investors should know.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides exposure to many of the most influential companies\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 tracks the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which measures the performance of 500 large U.S. companies. Included in the benchmark index are value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors. The S&P 500 is usually seen as the best gauge for the overall domestic stock market because it covers about 80% of domestic equities by market value.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 also includes approximately 40% of global equities by market value, meaning it provides exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world. Listed below are the top 10 positions in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF:\n\nNvidia: 8.4%Apple: 6.8%Microsoft: 6.5%Alphabet: 5%Amazon: 4%Broadcom: 2.9%Meta Platforms: 2.4%Tesla: 2.1%Berkshire Hathaway: 1.5%JPMorgan Chase: 1.4%\n\nBuffett once bet $500,000 that he could beat a hedge fund with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffett wagered $500,000 that no professional investor could outperform an S&P 500 index fund over an extended period. He even offered to let the contender select five hedge funds. Only one asset manager accepted the challenge: Buffett went head-to-head with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners between 2008 and 2017 -- and Buffett won.\n\nThe best-performing Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 fund returned 88% during that 10-year period, and the worst fund did so poorly that it was dissolved after nine years. Meanwhile, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF returned 126%, meaning Buffett won the competition by 38 percentage points.\n\nThink about that: With nothing but an S&P 500 index fund, Buffett beat 100-plus financial experts (i.e., each of the five funds was run by a different manager, and each manager invested in many other funds run by other professionals). Yet, those financial experts charge clients exorbitant fees for their services, while the S&P 500 has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning shareholders will pay just $3 annually on every $10,000 in the fund.\n\nHow the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF can turn $450 per month into $940,200\n\nThe S&P 500 achieved a total return of 1,820% over the last 30 years. It compounded at 10.3% annually during that period. Those decades include such a wide variety of economic and market conditions -- three recessions, three bear markets, and 13 market corrections -- that investors can reasonably assume similar returns over long periods in the future.\n\nAt that rate, $450 invested monthly in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would be worth $87,300 after one decade, $320,000 after two decades, and $940,200 after three decades, provided dividends are reinvested.\n\nHere's the bottom line: The S&P 500 has consistently produced stellar returns, such that professionals often struggle to beat the index. That makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF a good option for almost every investor, even those who prefer individual stocks. You are unlikely to find an index fund with a lower expense ratio and a better track record.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.
