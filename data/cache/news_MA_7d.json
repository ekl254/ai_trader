(Forbes puts his net worth at $37 billion.) Despite his fortune, Buffett is known for living a modest lifestyle, by billionaire standards. His primary residence remains the gray stucco Nebraska home he purchased for $31,500 nearly 50 years ago, according to Forbes, and his folksy Midwestern manner and penchant for simple pleasures -- a cherry Coke, a good burger, and a good book are all near the top of the list -- have been well-documented.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop Financial Stocks\n\nDividend Aristocrats 2024\n\nWide Moat Stocks\n\nRecession Proof Stocks\n\nCheapest Value Stocks\n\nFactor-Based Stock Portfolios\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Here's My Top Buy for 2026.", "content": "Key Points\n\nMany of Berkshire's top holdings are industry-leading companies that deliver consistent results. Visa has a predictable runway for future growth. The payment processor just rewarded shareholders with over $22 billion in stock buybacks and dividends.10 stocks we like better than Visa \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) holds positions in over 40 publicly traded companies, six of which are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI).\n\nThe Dow has 30 components in total, and four out of five of Berkshire's largest holdings are Dow stocks: Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nAdditionally, Berkshire owns Amazon, which was added to the Dow last year, and Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nHere's why Visa is my top buy of these six names for 2026.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA high-margin cash cow\n\nBerkshire's public equity portfolio is worth approximately $302 billion. But its controlled businesses are arguably even more valuable. The crown jewel is its property and casualty insurance businesses. Given Berkshire's expertise in finding value in the financial sector, it's no surprise that it owns all three of the major credit card companies -- American Express, Visa, and Mastercard.\n\nVisa is the largest of the three, both in terms of market capitalization and transaction volume. The more cards that enter the Visa network, the greater the incentive for merchants worldwide to accept Visa, which boosts revenue that can be used to partner with even more financial institutions, in turn leading to more card issuances. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Visa is converting nearly half of its revenue into free cash flow (FCF) -- which showcases just how efficiently its business operates.\n\nV Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nVisa's main expenses are related to maintaining and expanding its network, labor, and marketing. It's a very capital-light business model, especially considering that Visa partners with financial institutions to issue cards. By not issuing its own cards, Visa doesn't have to worry about bearing the credit risk. So it's not liable for how responsibly or irresponsibly its card users manage their spending.\n\nAnother benefit is that it doesn't have to pay its users rewards. That's also done by financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase's Chase Sapphire and Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Bank of America Customer Cash Rewards card, or the Wells Fargo Active Cash card, which are all Visa cards. By comparison, American Express spends more than double on cardmember perks than it collects in annual fees (but it makes up for that shortfall in other ways).\n\nVisa passes along its free cash flow to shareholders\n\nVisa's high-margin business makes it arguably the greatest cash cow in the financial services industry.\n\nBecause Visa has low capital expenditures, it is able to convert nearly all of its operating cash flow into FCF. Visa returns that FCF to shareholders through dividends and more, importantly, stock buybacks. Metric Full Year Fiscal 2025 Net cash provided by operating activities $23.06 billion Capital expenditures $1.48 billion Free cash flow $21.58 billion Share repurchases $18.19 billion Dividends $4.63 billion\n\nData source: Visa. Fiscal year 2025 ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn Visa's 2025 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2025, the company returned roughly 4 times more cash through stock buybacks than dividends. Here lies Visa's ace in the hole. By using its FCF on buybacks over dividends, Visa consistently reduces its share count. With fewer shares to go around, Visa's earnings per share increase from the core business growing earnings as well as through a lower outstanding share count.\n\nBuybacks are a significant reason why Visa is still a good value. Despite Visa's stock price increasing over fourfold in the last decade, Visa's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still just 32.3 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is lower than its 10-year median P/E of 34.3.\n\nIf Visa were to reallocate share repurchases toward dividends, it would yield a whopping 3.6% instead of its actual yield of 0.8%. However, long-term investors would prefer Visa to continue buying back stock disproportionately and paying a relatively small dividend, as it's a better use of capital if the stock continues to perform well.\n\nYou can count on Visa in 2026 and beyond\n\nVisa checks all the boxes of a high-quality stock to buy now. Major indexes, such as the S&P 500, sport relatively expensive valuations because many of the largest companies by market capitalization have seen their stock prices rise faster than earnings, which puts pressure on these companies to deliver on expectations.\n\nVisa doesn't have that problem because its valuation is reasonable. And yet, it's not a stodgy, low-growth stock like Coca-Cola, where investors can only pencil in mid-single-digit annual earnings growth. Visa should continue to grow earnings in the low double digits per year, even if consumer spending declines.\n\nAdd it all up, and Visa is one of my highest-conviction buys for 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

See the stocks \u00bb\n\nA beaten-up pharmaceutical giant, as well as two world-class businesses within the financial services market sector, stand out as top dividend stocks to buy in November.\n\nHere is a quick rundown on each opportunity.\n\nImage source: Novo Nordisk.\n\n1. Novo Nordisk\n\nIt can be hard to believe that Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO), the company behind highly popular GLP-1 agonist weight-loss and diabetes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, would have done so poorly. But here we are; the stock has plunged nearly 70% from its all-time high. The Danish pharmaceutical company, which specializes in treatments for diabetes and obesity, has gotten its butt kicked by competition.\n\nNot only has arch-rival Eli Lillytaken market share from Novo Nordisk, but the company has also felt pressure from compounding pharmacies that sprang up during drug shortages and never really went away. The selling appears overdone. Shares trade at under 14 times 2025 earnings estimates, and the dividend yield is approaching an all-time high at 3.6%.\n\nNovo Nordisk should have plenty of growth opportunities in the obesity drug market, which could swell to $150 billion over the next decade. The company also changed out its CEO earlier this year, and the new CEO has been more aggressive in strategic acquisitions and sales strategies to push back against the competition. Novo Nordisk's steep decline might look like an obvious buying opportunity in hindsight.\n\n2. Moody's\n\nThe global economy relies on debt. Moody's Corporation(NYSE: MCO) is one of the leading authorities in that space. The company sells financial data and research, and is one of the two primary agencies that rate bonds. The company has been in business for over a century, so it enjoys a powerful reputation. The Moody's brand name makes it difficult for competitors to challenge its business.\n\nMoody's business is built on its data and other intangible assets. Therefore, the company is highly profitable. Companies and governments borrow constantly, so Moody's business is also relatively steady. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 15 consecutive years. The dividend payout ratio is only a quarter of 2025 earnings estimates, leaving plenty of room for future increases.\n\nThe stock's not a bargain, but fantastic companies rarely come cheap. However, shares do seem reasonably priced at the moment. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32 against 2025 estimates isn't a bad valuation for a business that analysts estimate will grow by 11% to 12% annually over the next three to five years.\n\n3. Mastercard\n\nThe global shift from cash to debit and credit card payments has been a long and powerful tailwind for Mastercard(NYSE: MA) and the other leading payment network companies. Mastercard has consistently grown and maintained healthy profit margins, generating billions of dollars in cash flow annually. As a result, Mastercard has paid and raised its dividend for 14 consecutive years.\n\nMastercard's business is like a toll. It charges fees on each transaction that goes through its network. While that may mean Mastercard's business could fluctuate with the economy, potentially slowing during a recession as people spend less, the percentage-based fee structure means that fees rise with inflation. That builds long-term growth into Mastercard's business as prices and transaction values increase.\n\nThe stock currently trades at more than 32 times 2025 earnings estimates. While that's not cheap, it's another example of an excellent business trading at a fair price. Mastercard is a cash-flow machine with solid growth ahead. Analysts see Mastercard growing earnings at an annualized rate of 15% over the next three to five years. That's enough growth to justify buying this proven winner at these levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Novo Nordisk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Novo Nordisk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Novo Nordisk wasn\u2019t one of them.

Following his remarks, market expectations for a rate cut in December shifted significantly. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a December rate reduction surged from a 37% chance earlier in the day to 70%.

With networks including Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, and PayPal adopting stablecoin settlement, the use of digital dollars is becoming more established.\n\nAccording to the team, many investors continue to face challenges in understanding the structure of stablecoins, the distinctions among them, and the considerations involved in evaluating these assets. Stablecoins maintain their value through collateralization with real assets, typically fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, commodities including gold, or cryptocurrencies. Some models use algorithmic mechanisms that adjust supply and demand to support price stability.\n\nAs markets turn volatile z, investors are converting their risk-assets into digital dollars to protect value without fluctuation. Bluwhale's Stablecoin AI Agent, then, continuously scans hundreds of chains, protocols and DeFi platforms from tokenized T-bills and CeFi interest accounts to DeFi lending and liquidity pools to automatically allocate to the solution with the opportunities aligned with the stated risk-profile.\n\n\"Stablecoins have grown so fast in the past year that consumers struggle to evaluate financial opportunities as well as the technical nature for every one of them,\" said Han Jin, CEO, Bluwhale. \"We're giving millions of users the ability to earn competitive returns on digital dollars safely, automatically, and without navigating technical solutions on-chain. The future of wealth building should be powered by AI agents that identify and manage financial options for you, 24/7.\"\n\nBluwhale's AI agents analyze, evaluate and transact in real time on the blockchain to take advantage of the surplus of stablecoins in circulation during volatile markets, creating thousands of transactions and volume for DeFi applications encompassing lending and yield strategies, trigger arbitrage opportunities, as well as liquid staking pools among others.\n\nEach decision is personalized, taking into account a user's Whale Score (Bluwhale's holistic financial health metric), Bluwhale profile behavior, financial risk-appetite based on asset holdings, as well as time horizon, and overall financial goals. The result is an autonomous, always-on customized portfolio manager that supports users in managing stablecoin holdings without requiring detailed knowledge of complex financial or technical digital asset systems.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"It's a powerful flywheel as more agents serve a single user in different aspects, it leads to more AI queries on Bluwhale's network, which leads to more $BLUAI burned and financial value returned to users. Every stablecoin transaction by our AI agents becomes fuel for the Bluwhale network, consuming gas fees in $BLUAI,\" Jin added. \"Other AI agents in Bluwhale's agent store could tackle many other financial solutions for you while being trained by your profile, preferences and behavior, rebalancing portfolios, trading memecoins and lending your assets at higher yields and efficiency.\"\n\nGen Z and Stablecoins\n\nGen Z is showing increased adoption of digital dollars, with 42 percent reporting the use of stablecoins for everyday transactions, a share three times higher than that of Gen X, and 75 percent indicating a willingness to receive wages on-chain, according to 2025 data from The Motley Fool. With traditional financial systems often described as complex and less transparent, Bluwhale's Stablecoin Agent provides automated tools designed to support consistent, risk-aware activity across wallets and major exchanges.\n\nCombined with the Whale Score, which is used by 3.6 million individuals, the Stablecoin Agent helps convert routine activity into measurable financial outcomes..\n\n\"The timing is perfect,\" Jin said. \"Stablecoin integrations are accelerating across payment networks, and AI agents will soon run most on-chain financial activity. Bluwhale is leading that transformation.\"\n\nThe Stablecoin Investment Agent is available now, following Bluwhale's $BLUAI Token Generation Event.

What started as a $5.7 billion offer has swelled past $200 billion in the latest settlement proposal, a bid meant to end the fight over the fees merchants pay every time a customer swipes a card. But instead of smoothing tensions, the new deal has stirred fresh resistance from retailers and politicians, raising the possibility that premium card acceptance could be squeezed if the pact moves forward.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN. Is V fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nWalmart has already signaled that it will likely challenge the settlement, pointing back to the concerns that helped sink a previous $30 billion version last year. The National Retail Federation says the card networks just don't get it or just don't care, warning that the agreement could reshape the industry in ways that may be difficult to unwind. Restaurant groups are pushing back too, arguing that thin margins and limited bargaining power leave them particularly exposed in a system they describe as dominated by two players. Merchant coalitions continue to argue that the latest terms may not offer enough relief to the businesses footing the bill.\n\nPolitical pressure is building alongside the retail backlash. Senator Dick Durbin, a longtime critic of swipe fees and a force behind earlier debit-fee caps, said the new settlement could still fall short for both merchants and consumers at a time when household budgets remain under strain. Now the spotlight shifts to US District Court Judge Brian Cogan, who took over the case in September and is not expected to offer signals before the Dec. 12 objection deadline. Analysts note that this deal involves a mandatory class with no opt-outs, meaning any major retailer grievances could be decisive as one of the longest-running battles in payments enters another uncertain chapter.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/200-billion-swipe-fee-showdown-181809268.html", "symbols": ["3V6.F", "3V64.F", "AMZN.US", "M4I.BE", "M4I.DU", "M4I.F", "M4I.HA", "M4I.HM", "M4I.MU", "M4I0.F", "MA.MX", "MA.US", "MSCD34.SA", "V.MX", "V.US", "VISA34.SA", "WALM34.SA", "WMT.BA", "WMT.BE", "WMT.F"], "tags": ["LEGAL-BATTLE", "PAYMENTS", "RETAIL", "SETTLEMENT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.966, "neg": 0.132, "neu": 0.807, "pos": 0.06}}, {"date": "2025-11-21T17:07:00+00:00", "title": "Will AmEx's Travel &amp; Lifestyle Services Become Its Next Profit Engine?", "content": "American Express Company AXP, popularly known as AmEx, is quietly transforming its travel and lifestyle services offerings into a much bigger growth engine than most people realize. These have always been a key part of the company\u2019s premium appeal, but their significance is growing as consumers increasingly favor experience over material goods. The platform has evolved into a comprehensive concierge ecosystem, crafted to make travel planning a breeze, unlock exclusive benefits and provide a level of service that keeps its high-value customers deeply engaged within the AmEx network.\n\nIt blends human expertise with digital conveniences. Members can enjoy access to curated itineraries, fine-dining reservations, last-minute hotel deals and personalized travel assistance that goes well beyond standard booking tools. One of its standout features is the network effect: AmEx taps into its long-standing connections with luxury hotels, airlines and experience providers to secure upgrades, exclusive rates and perks. This unique ecosystem sets it apart, especially for Platinum and Centurion cardholders who are looking for tailored service.\n\nBeyond just travel, it is expanding into lifestyle areas like event access, dining programs and one-of-a-kind cultural experiences. This expansion helps AmEx not merely as a payments brand but as a reliable partner in enhancing and planning the everyday lives of its members.\n\nAnother standout feature is AmEx Passport, a digital tool for cardholders to commemorate and save their travel memories. If the company continues to expand this experience-driven model while keeping an eye on the costs of providing top-notch benefits, its travel and lifestyle services will evolve from a standout feature to a significant profit driver in the coming years.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring?\n\nSome of AXP\u2019s competitors, which enhanced benefits to improve travel and lifestyle experiences, include Mastercard Incorporated MA and Visa Inc.

But at least the stock is up over the last five years. Unfortunately its return of 55% is below the market return of 76%.\n\nIn light of the stock dropping 5.0% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Mastercard achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).NYSE:MA Earnings Per Share Growth November 21st 2025\n\nWe know that Mastercard has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Mastercard will grow revenue in the future.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Mastercard's TSR for the last 5 years was 59%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nMastercard provided a TSR of 3.1% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 10% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 1 warning sign  with Mastercard , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of undervalued small caps that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

In November 2024, an agreement was signed with the European Central Bank (ECB) for Norway to join the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross-Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system. This collaboration marks Norway's commitment to leveraging the Eurosystem's TIPS for instantaneous transactions in its national currency. The anticipated rollout of this new instant payment settlement service is slated for the first half of 2028. In December 2024, Vipps launched its NFC contactless payment solution. The solution is the first outside of Apple Pay to make use of NFC technology in iPhones for payments. Identical to Apple Pay, payment is made by tapping a phone on a payment terminal. Vipps NFC is also available for users with smartphones other than iPhone. The solution is available for nearly 70% of Norwegian bank customers. Currently, Vipps NFC only supports BankAxept cards. There are plans to include international cards in Vipps NFC to enable the solution to be used abroad. To further enhance customer convenience, in 2024, Vipps launched a new payment service for transfers between Vipps customers in the Nordic region (excluding Iceland). This service enables card-based transactions using Visa Direct and Mastercard Send and it requires both the payer and the payee to be Vipps customers. Additionally, the payee must register a recipient payment card within the Vipps app and transfers are made in the payee's currency, with funds typically accessible immediately, depending on the payee's bank.\n\nStory Continues\n\nScope\n\nCard market size in terms of number of cards, value and volume of transactions in Norway along with detailed card segmentation of debit, credit and charge cards available in the country.

In October 2025, Mastercard and Citi expanded their Flex Pay offering, enabling cardholders to split eligible purchases into predictable installments directly at checkout.\n\nAffirm is making a significant impact in the BNPL space by embracing real-time underwriting and emphasizing predictable repayment plans.

The product is designed to better recognize when consumers are shopping and deliver more personalized results by leveraging insights from their past searches.\n\nAgentic commerce is a new wave in online shopping, where advanced AI agents act on behalf of consumers to discover, compare and purchase products. These intelligent agents anticipate consumer needs, tailor recommendations, automate transactions, and even negotiate deals across multiple platforms to create a smooth, frictionless shopping experience.\n\nTo lead this new era of AI-powered commerce, PayPal launched its agentic commerce services last month. It is a comprehensive suite of solutions that enable merchants to attract customers for AI-driven shopping. PayPal leverages its network of more than 400 million active accounts and presence in over 200 markets to scale this new commerce model globally.\n\nPayPal's agentic commerce ecosystem involves collaborations with leading AI and e-commerce companies like OpenAI, Google Cloud, Wix, Cymbio, Commerce (which encompasses BigCommerce and Feedonomics) and Shopware, to provide scalable, secure, and user-friendly AI e-commerce experiences for merchants and consumers worldwide.\n\nHow Are Mastercard and Shopify Doing in the Agentic Commerce Space?\n\nMastercard MA introduced the Mastercard Agent Pay program in September 2025, enabling U.S. cardholders to shop online using AI agents securely and seamlessly. It collaborates with Stripe and Google to build agentic commerce infrastructure and standards. MA developed \"Insight Tokens\" to offer personalized, secure consumer experiences within agentic commerce, leading the way in trusted AI-driven commerce.\n\nShopify SHOP launched its Commerce Assistant Agent framework in mid-2025, allowing developers to embed AI-powered agents into Shopify workflows for tasks like merchandising and customer support.

Mastercard's business is well-adapted to navigate inflationary periods; it also has a terrific dividend program. 10 stocks we like better than Vertex Pharmaceuticals \u203a\n\nInflation can be a significant problem for investors in at least two ways. First, the rise in prices leads to increased costs and expenses for corporations, as well as decreased consumer spending, which harms businesses' financial results. Second, inflation reduces purchasing power over time. Fortunately, investing in stocks can help get around those issues.\n\nOver the long run, equities have outpaced inflation, making them a good hedge against it. And some companies perform relatively well financially even in inflationary periods. However, it's crucial to invest in the right companies, preferably those whose businesses are well-equipped to withstand significant price rises and can also match, or even exceed, the performance of the broader market.\n\nLet's consider two great examples: Vertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) and Mastercard(NYSE: MA).Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals, a leading biotech company, can perform well despite inflation thanks to its pricing power, a characteristic many drugmakers possess. Medicines are granted patents that protect them from generic or biosimilar competition for a long time, allowing their makers to charge significantly higher prices than they would otherwise be able to. However, most therapies still have to compete with drugs that treat the same illnesses.\n\nThat's not the case here. Vertex's core cystic fibrosis (CF) franchise is the only game in town for patients with this rare genetic disease that affects internal organs, so the company has performed well over the past decade. Its revenue and earnings have generally grown steadily as it continues to make significant breakthroughs in CF.VRTX Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nThe biotech still has plenty of room to grow here. Although CF is rare, patients taking Vertex's medications typically need to take them regularly for life. That's not counting the thousands who are eligible for its current therapies but have yet to start treatment. So Vertex Pharmaceuticals should continue riding this wave for a while longer, especially since its most important medicines won't encounter patent cliffs until the second half of the next decade.\n\nIn the meantime, the company is developing newer therapies. Vertex has launched Casgevy, a treatment for two rare blood diseases, and Journavx, a non-opioid oral therapy for the management of acute pain. And it has more exciting candidates in the pipeline, including zimislecel, a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes, and inaxaplin, a medicine for APOL-1-mediated kidney disease.\n\nStory Continues\n\nVertex has encountered some clinical setbacks this year, so the stock has not performed well, but its prospects are attractive. The biotech could deliver market-beating returns over the medium term as it makes more headway into its core market, newer products gain traction, and it launches other brand-new medicines. Vertex Pharmaceuticals remains a great pick to help hedge against inflation.\n\n2. Mastercard\n\nMastercard is a leading payment network company that most people recognize, because millions of cards in circulation are branded with its logo. The financial services specialist helps process card transactions by connecting merchants and banks through its network. Mastercard earns money through fees it charges for every transaction it helps process.\n\nSince these fees are calculated as a percentage of the purchase amount, inflation results in higher revenue per transaction. True, the rise in prices can cool down consumer spending, which harms Mastercard's revenue growth. Overall, however, these two forces somewhat offset one another, and Mastercard is generally able to perform relatively well despite inflationary pressures.\n\nAnd over the long run, the company can also outpace the broader market for at least two reasons.\n\nFirst, Mastercard has exceptional growth prospects. The company still estimates trillions of dollars' worth of cash and check transactions can be converted into digital ones. And although Mastercard has a smaller global market share than its larger rival Visa, it has greater exposure to international markets where credit card penetration is even lower; this presents explosive growth potential (even if that also comes with a bit more risk).\n\nSecond, Mastercard is an exceptional dividend stock. Don't let its 0.6% forward yield fool you. The company has increased its dividend by 300% over the past decade, while still boasting a highly conservative cash payout ratio of 18.1%, and has ample room to increase its dividend further. Reinvesting Mastercard's growing regular payout will help boost returns over the long run, lifting them even higher above those of broader equities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn\u2019t one of them.

The event brought together leaders from government, philanthropy, the private sector, and other partners to spotlight success stories, share learnings, and identify new opportunities in the state's small business ecosystem.\n\nSpeakers highlighted how economic growth in Alabama, as well as broader economic changes, are creating both new opportunities and new challenges. For example, while new investments are being made in the state, uneven access to resources and fast-changing technologies risk leaving many small businesses behind unless the local small business support ecosystem can bridge the gap between today's realities and tomorrow's potential.\n\nAs Coreata R. Houser, the Interim Director of the Department of Innovation and Economic Opportunity for the City of Birmingham put it: \"Frankly, in economic development, making the numbers work on paper is the easy part. The harder part is making sure your constituents can access the resources they need to grow their businesses,\" he said, listing investments in roads, childcare infrastructure, and workforce development as examples of what Birmingham is doing to broaden access to opportunity.\n\nBuilding a more coordinated ecosystem in Birmingham\n\nIn a city that has at least 65 small business support organizations, as well as a diverse community of public, private, and philanthropic sector funders and partners, what does building better bridges look like? And how can these efforts be better coordinated into a more holistic strategy for supporting entrepreneurs?\n\nPart of the answer is the Entrepreneurship Center for Growth and Excellence, a new entrepreneurship center in Birmingham that has already mapped the opportunities and gaps in the city's small business ecosystem. The Center is now focusing on developing a shared vision among the city's many stakeholders as well as a data-driven roadmap - in addition to a front door where small businesses can get support.\n\nJohn Turner, CEO of Regions Bank, spoke about why his bank has gotten so involved in supporting and scaling this new center.\n\n\"Our businesses can only be as good as the health of the communities where we operate, and the health of communities is largely about jobs, job growth, and people's ability to earn a good wage,\" he said. \"We have a lot of small businesses that I think have a real opportunity to scale up. But they can benefit from some tailored advice and guidance in doing that sustainably, and we think can help provide that.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs Kendra Key, the Executive Director of the Center and a loaned executive from Regions Bank, put it: \"This is infrastructure building. It is about coordinating our ecosystem and enabling work that serves our shared customer - Birmingham's small businesses.\"\n\nDeep dives on rural entrepreneurship and manufacturing\n\nOther panels spoke to the challenges of supporting small businesses in rural areas and manufacturing specifically. For example, while there are more than 65 small business support organizations in Birmingham, there are few in Alabama's rural counties despite the depth of entrepreneurial potential.\n\n\"Capital flows down the path of least resistance every time, so the question is how to remove the friction of capital flowing into rural communities,\" said Alex Flachsbart, Founder & CEO of Opportunity Alabama, a nonprofit dedicated to developing an impact-centered Opportunity Zones ecosystem across the state. \"We have seen that if you create the right support infrastructure for dynamic people in rural communities, and you keep showing up, great things can happen.\"\n\nClaudia Pettway Charley, Co-Founder of Sew Gee's Bend Heritage Builders, a community-based nonprofit organization located in the heart of the rural community Gee's Bend, also spoke about the impact that organizations can have in communities like hers.\n\n\"When there are a lot of needs, almost anything you do will be helpful,\" she said. \"What we don't need is a lot of things going out of the community as much as we do [resources] coming into the community.\"\n\nIn the panel discussion on manufacturing, the focus was on the trainings and investments necessary to unlock further growth - with a particular focus on the needs of small businesses. The role of technological training was one example.\n\n\"We have seen that technology is accelerating faster than many small businesses can keep up,\" said Lee Mathews, the COO of Innovate Alabama, the first statewide public-private partnership focused on entrepreneurship, technology, and innovation. \"So it is very important to provide small businesses in manufacturing with early exposure to cybersecurity, data, and AI, especially as the role of computer science increases in manufacturing.\"\n\nMathew's fellow panelist Lauren Hyde, Executive Director of the Alabama Business Intelligence Center - Alabama's first dedicated business research hub focused on economic development - spoke on a similar topic: her organization's work creating Birmingham AI, an initiative that convenes people to make AI accessible, and connects new companies entering the state with local partners, including many small businesses.\n\nCybersecurity was also a major discussion topic given the increasingly digital nature of manufacturing.\n\n\"Any system that can be accessed or operated remotely introduces potential cybersecurity risks,\" said LaVada Varner, Center Director of the Alabama Technology Network, a statewide organization dedicated to advancing training and innovation within Alabama's manufacturing sector. \"Manufacturers are increasingly being targeted through equipment that is connected to the Internet and unsecured networks, which makes proactive cybersecurity education and training essential to protecting their operations.\"\n\nVarner also emphasized the growing importance of certification and standards compliance for smaller manufacturers. \"Many large companies now require ISO or similar certifications as a prerequisite for partnership,\" she said. \"ISO standards have become the common language of manufacturing, providing the structure and assurance that larger firms expect from their suppliers.\"\n\nThe call to action\n\nDespite the turbulent times, panelists across the board were optimistic about what lies ahead. The Mayor of Birmingham, Randall L. Woodfin, spoke to this optimism in the closing conversation.\n\n\"All of our successes in Birmingham have been rooted in public-private partnerships,\" he said. \"And based on the momentum we have, there's never been a better time to invest in supporting our small businesses. Everyone is stepping up to the plate, leaning in, and being vulnerable enough to say, \u2018how can we get this ecosystem of supporting and building our small businesses better?'\"\n\nJohn Turner added, \"We're fortunate to have solid leadership in Birmingham, from City Hall to the business community, including business development centers and nonprofits. Increasingly, we see a clear and common vision for growth - and a network of organizations ready to support it. If we can keep building on this unity and collaboration, there truly is no limit to what we can accomplish - together.\"\n\nView original content here.\n\nFollow along Mastercard's journey to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere.\n\nAbout Mastercard\n\nMastercard powers economies and empowers people in 200+ countries and territories worldwide.

Time to Follow Suit?", "content": "Fundsmith\n\nQuick Read\n\nFundsmith sold its entire Mastercard (MA) position in Q3 and cut Meta Platforms by over half. Fundsmith trimmed positions aggressively in 2025 with minimal buying activity. Berkshire Hathaway built cash to $382B while Fundsmith reduced equity exposure amid high valuations. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nTerry Smith, founder of Fundsmith, has earned the nickname, the \"English Warren Buffett\" for his disciplined, long-term approach to investing in high-quality companies at reasonable prices -- much like the Oracle of Omaha himself.\n\nSince launching the Fundsmith Equity Fund in 2010, Smith has delivered strong returns by focusing on a concentrated portfolio of resilient global growth stocks, avoiding hype-driven sectors, and emphasizing businesses with high returns on capital and predictable cash flows. His straightforward style, annual shareholder letters critiquing market excesses, and personal investment in his own fund mirror Buffett's philosophy at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B). With around $20 billion in assets under management, Fundsmith remains one of the U.K.'s most successful active funds.\n\nNow, Smith appears to be echoing Buffett's recent caution. While the Oracle has built Berkshire Hathaway's cash hoard to a record $382 billion by net selling stocks for multiple quarters, Smith has spent much of 2025 trimming positions aggressively with only minor additions -- suggesting both legends see limited attractive opportunities at current valuations.\n\nA Year of Ruthless Pruning\n\nPortfolio trimming has defined Fundsmith's activity throughout 2025. Smith's strategy of \"buy good companies, don't overpay, and do nothing\" shifts to active reduction when valuations stretch too far. 13F filings and updates show consistent sales across quarters, reducing exposure to expensive names while cash balances implicitly rise.\n\nThe pattern intensified in the third quarter. Reports indicate Smith fully exited at least five positions, including completely selling out of Mastercard (NYSE:MA). He also cut Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) -- once a top holding -- by more than half and slashed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) almost in half. These moves reduced exposure to high-multiple tech leaders that drove much of the market's gains.\n\nOn the buy side, activity stayed minimal. Smith nominally added to Visa (NYSE:V) -- his fifth-largest holding today -- and made small increases in Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). These remain relatively minor positions in the roughly 30-stock portfolio, underscoring that additions were dwarfed by sales.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOverall, the fund's equity exposure contracted, with top holdings becoming even more concentrated in remaining names like Stryker (NASDAQ:SYK) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nEchoes of Omaha\n\nThis mirrors Buffett's playbook. Berkshire has been a persistent net seller, unloading big stakes in companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) while struggling to find full replacements for its capital. Both investors seem to share a view that many quality stocks -- especially in tech and consumer -- trade at premiums that leave little margin of safety. With markets hitting repeated highs amid AI enthusiasm, forward earnings multiples have expanded sharply, making it harder to justify new commitments.\n\nSmith has long warned against overpaying, even for excellent businesses. His recent letters highlight concerns over elevated valuations and concentration risks in indices dominated by a handful of mega-caps. By selling into strength and waiting, he preserves firepower for better entry points, just as Buffett hoards cash rather than chase momentum.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nBuffett and Smith signal growing distrust in today's valuations. While some billionaires place large short bets on leading AI names and others exit entirely, these value purists prefer patience over participation. Their actions suggest the market's enthusiasm may have outrun fundamentals, leaving stocks vulnerable to disappointment.\n\nRetail investors don't need to liquidate everything -- Smith and Buffett remain fully invested in their best ideas -- but protecting downside makes sense. Consider raising cash allocations, hedging concentrated positions, or stress-testing portfolios against higher rates or earnings misses. When two of the world's best wait on the sidelines, it often pays to take notice.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Photo by BeInCrypto\n\nArthur Firstov is the Chief Business Officer at Mercuryo, a global leader in crypto payments infrastructure. With over seven years of experience in fintech, B2B partnerships, and digital assets, Arthur has helped Mercuryo scale past $50 million in annual revenue and secure partnerships with more than 300 companies \u2014 including Circle, Coinbase, Mastercard, Revolut, and Polymarket.\n\nHe has become a recognized voice and expert on stablecoins, digital banking, and the convergence of Web3 and traditional finance.\n\nQ1: You\u2019ve been in crypto payments since 2017 \u2014 before it was fashionable, and long before \u2018tokenized Treasuries\u2019 were a headline. Looking back at 2025 so far \u2014 how would you describe the industry\u2019s trajectory?\n\nArthur Firstov: The market\u2019s matured. The noise is gone, and what\u2019s left are real rails \u2014 stablecoin settlement, tokenized assets, on-chain treasury systems, regulated custody. We\u2019ve moved from narrative to utility. Crypto isn\u2019t trying to replace traditional finance anymore; it\u2019s quietly wiring itself *into* it. At Mercuryo, that\u2019s been our thesis from the start \u2014 connecting the crypto economy to the financial infrastructure the world already runs on.\n\nQ2: Many experts call tokenization \u2018crypto\u2019s killer app.\u2019 What\u2019s different this time?\n\nArthur Firstov: Regulation and yield. In 2023, tokenization was a demo \u2014 now it\u2019s a product. Regions like the EU and Singapore have clear rules, and high yields make tokenized Treasuries attractive. Beyond that, we\u2019re seeing wallet-native issuance. Look at what MetaMask did with M0 \u2014 launching its own stablecoin infrastructure. Wallets aren\u2019t just gateways anymore; they\u2019re becoming issuers of financial products.\n\nQ3: Let\u2019s talk about payments. Stablecoins processed around $46 trillion this year. What does \u2018mainstream\u2019 actually look like?\n\nArthur Firstov: It looks invisible. Stablecoins will stop being the story \u2014 they\u2019ll just be the plumbing. We\u2019re seeing this with Revolut \u2014 integrating rails that let users move money directly from bank accounts into self-custodial wallets. Mercuryo plugs into that flow, turning multi-day processes into instant transactions.\n\nQ4: 2025 is being called \u2018the year institutions arrived.\u2019 What changed?\n\nArthur Firstov: Infrastructure and mindset. Custody is regulated, liquidity deep, and compliance automated. When you can tokenize a Treasury and settle it globally in minutes, it\u2019s no longer an experiment. We work closely with MasterCard, which now issues crypto cards letting users spend stablecoins from wallets directly at merchants. That\u2019s real-world adoption \u2014 not speculation.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nQ5: Multicoin says crypto now competes for attention, not just capital. Do you agree?\n\nArthur Firstov: Absolutely. Attention drives liquidity. Memecoins onboard users, but stablecoins and RWAs keep them. It\u2019s the same funnel social media followed \u2014 attention first, utility next.\n\nQ6: What\u2019s next? What will prove that crypto has become infrastructure by 2026?\n\nArthur Firstov: 1. Tokenized Treasuries cross $500B. 2. Stablecoin settlement volume surpasses Visa. 3. A neobank runs stablecoin rails by default \u2014 and doesn\u2019t even market it as \u2018crypto.\u2019\n\nQ7: And for the average person?\n\nArthur Firstov: Money moves like data \u2014 borderless, instant, programmable. You\u2019ll send value as easily as sending a message. That\u2019s when crypto truly disappears \u2014 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re building toward at Mercuryo.\n\nRead original story Crypto Becomes Infrastructure \u2014 A Conversation with Arthur Firstov, CBO of Mercuryo by Advertorial at beincrypto.com\n\n\u67e5\u770b\u7559\u8a00", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-becomes-infrastructure-conversation-arthur-080000104.html", "symbols": ["COIN.US", "CRCL.US", "MA.US"], "tags": ["CRYPTO-PAYMENTS", "REGULATION", "STABLECOINS", "TOKENIZATION", "TREASURIES"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.97, "neg": 0.016, "neu": 0.914, "pos": 0.07}}, {"date": "2025-11-19T02:51:00+00:00", "title": "Fast Payout Online Casinos: Lucky Creek Ranked First for Instant Withdrawals", "content": "Lucky Creek\n\nLucky Creek leads fast payout online casinos with rapid, verified withdrawal performance\n\nNew York, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Lucky Creek Casino\n\nCasinoTop10.net, a renowned platform for iGaming reviews, has officially named Lucky Creek Casino as the best online casino for instant withdrawals.

Chargeflow has tripled revenue year over year and now powers over 15,000 merchants worldwide.\n\nOriginally meant to protect consumers, chargebacks have become a major source of loss for merchants. Mastercard projects chargeback volume to rise 24% by 2028, reaching 324 million chargebacks annually, with nearly 80% driven by \"friendly fraud.\" Merchants now lose over $100 billion each year to disputes. Chargeflow's AI platform automates the process end-to-end \u2014 preventing disputes before they occur and recovering lost revenue with up to four times higher win rates.\n\nEach chargeback requires merchants to manually gather and submit evidence across fragmented systems, consuming valuable time and resources. Chargeflow eliminates this friction through full automation, integrating with over 100 leading payment, data, and eCommerce platforms, including Shopify, Stripe, PayPal, WooCommerce, Adyen, and Afterpay, to detect, manage, and prevent chargebacks at scale.\n\nThe platform automatically collects and analyzes transaction data, builds and submits evidence, and tracks dispute outcomes in real time. Powered by AI-driven fraud detection, Chargeflow also proactively identifies and prevents friendly fraud before it occurs, alerting merchants the moment a potential chargeback is detected and giving them a decisive advantage.\n\n\"Chargebacks were designed to protect consumers, but over time the system has become unbalanced, favoring buyers and leaving merchants powerless,\" said Ariel Chen, CEO and Co-founder of Chargeflow. \"We're on a mission to redefine the chargeback system itself, using AI to shift the balance of power back to merchants and create a truly fair, transparent, and automated future for digital commerce. With our industry-leading technology, we prevent nine out of ten disputes before they even occur and recover more revenue from the rest, restoring billions in fairness to the ecosystem. This funding enables us to expand globally, launch additional products that complete the Chargeflow AI ecosystem, and realize our vision for what chargebacks should be: intelligent, automatic, and equitable for every business.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"As global retail e-commerce has doubled in recent years to reach $7.5 trillion, chargeback volumes have also surged, becoming a significant challenge for merchants,\" said Natalie Refuah, General Partner, Viola Growth. \"We were highly impressed by how Chargeflow has established itself as the industry's gold standard, achieving growth-stage revenues with an AI-first product built with remarkable efficiency. Beyond its powerful dispute automation platform, we're equally excited about the company's expansion into new products\u2014Chargeflow Connect and Chargeflow Prevent\u2014which will further enhance its value to merchants worldwide.\"\n\nChargeflow's AI-driven platform applies machine learning and data automation to manage and prevent chargebacks at scale. Using proprietary algorithms and generative AI, Chargeflow automatically compiles and submits dispute evidence, enriches merchant data for accuracy, and continuously learns from millions of resolved cases across its 15,000+ merchant network. This same foundation now powers Chargeflow Prevent, extending the company's technology beyond chargeback recovery to proactively mitigate post-purchase fraud and friendly fraud disputes before they are initiated.\n\nHaving established its leadership among small and medium-sized businesses, Chargeflow is now expanding to serve enterprise-level merchants where transaction volumes \u2013 and consequently chargeback risks \u2013 are exponentially higher. The company has recently built out a new enterprise sales team headquartered in New York to support this next phase of growth.\n\nAbout Chargeflow\n\nChargeflow is the world's first fully automated chargeback management platform, built by eCommerce entrepreneurs to fight friendly fraud and restore fairness to digital commerce. Powered by generative AI, proprietary automation, and deep payments expertise, Chargeflow enables merchants to recover and prevent chargebacks at scale \u2014 completely hands-free.\n\nWith industry-leading win rates, a security-first architecture, and a guaranteed ROI model, Chargeflow protects billions in revenue for more than 15,000 merchants worldwide.

But not much has been said about the growing middle class in the region's mid-sized cities.\n\nKaren Ngui, second from right, head of the DBS Foundation and DBS Group Strategic Marketing and Communications, shares insights on building philanthropy that results in real change, with Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth President Shamina Singh, left, Tony Lambino, president and trustee of the Ayala Foundation, second from left, and Hari Menon, the Gates Foundation director for South and Southeast Asia.\n\nUntil now. On the sidelines of the 2025 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit last week in Kuala Lumpur, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth held its inaugural ASEAN Inclusive Growth Summit, where the burgeoning middle class was hot topic, despite reports in the international press of impending stagnation or even decline. \"It may rise a bit slower, but the momentum is still on for the global middle class and the Asian middle class to rise,\" said Wolfgang Fengler, CEO of World Data Lab.\n\nMost of that growth will be in Southeast Asia, a region that comprises 11 nations, with Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines as its largest economies. Fengler projects that by 2032, 112 million Southeast Asians will join the middle class: 50 million in Indonesia and another 50 million in the Philippines and Vietnam. \"So, if you would sell a bicycle or a motorcycle or a cheap airline ticket and you want to have a new customer, not one that is already established,\" Fengler concluded, \"you should go to ASEAN rather than to China.\"\n\nAlso top of mind: How government and business leaders can strengthen this group's aspirations and help them thrive while ensuring no one gets left behind. \"For growth to be considered truly inclusive, it must be shared, resilient, sustaining,\" said HRH Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah, the deputy king of Malaysia. \"Without inclusion, progress may be more fragile as inequality rises and trust in institutions erodes. The triple bottom line - people, planet, profit - must become central to our decision-making.\"\n\nThe summit - an outgrowth of The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth's annual Global Inclusive Growth Summit in Washington, D.C. - brought together business partners, customers, private and public sector leaders, policymakers and social changemakers from across Southeast Asia and beyond. With over 680 million people and a rapidly expanding middle class, Southeast Asia stands at a pivotal moment, poised to become the world's fourth-largest economy in the next five years. This momentum is driven by digital transformation, entrepreneurial spirit and cross-border collaboration.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"There is so much energy in this region,\" said Jon Huntsman, Mastercard vice chair and president, Strategic Growth, \"but to translate these trends into sustainable success, we must build an economy where everyone can contribute and connect to the benefits of growth.\"\n\nHere are three ways this evolution is already underway.\n\nTo grow small businesses, give them a microphone\n\nMicro-, small and medium-size businesses form the backbone of the Southeast Asian economy, comprising 85% of employment and contributing 45% of GDP across the region.\n\n\"The future of our region, the future of Southeast Asia, it's not going to be built by a few large mega businesses,\" said Pei Ying Chua, LinkedIn APAC head economist. \"It's going to be built by millions of small ones, because when small medium enterprises do well and they thrive, the region grows together.\"\n\nAnd these businesses grew exponentially during the pandemic, as owners discovered they didn't need to pay rent on brick-and-mortar premises. Instead, thanks to expanded broadband access across the region, they could sell their goods online from their homes. The digital economy is also providing greater opportunities for artisans in rural areas to connect with customers in other parts of the world.\n\nBut as these businesses started to grow, entrepreneurs realized that they lacked the marketing tools to help them get greater visibility, said Chanida Klyphun, director of Southeast Asia public policy at TikTok. TikTok joined with the ASEAN Foundation and the ASEAN Business Advisory Council to launch the ASEAN Store Together program earlier this year.\n\nIt works primarily with woman-led and rural entrepreneurs, and to date, it has trained 50 MSMEs and taught them how to list, livestream, and share information about their products on the TikTok Shop. TikTok also subsidized part of their revenue and provided discount codes to draw in more customers.\n\nThe results have been astounding. For example, after Magkawi, a woman-led cosmetics brand from the Philippines joined the TikTok Shop, its revenue increased by 80%. \"In the first live stream,\" Klyphun said, \"they made more money than what they made offline for the whole month.\"\n\nThe digital transformation has helped the playing field for smaller businesses and the gig economy, said Alex Hungate, the president and chief operating officer of the superapp Grab, but more work needs to be done - from enabling more access to critical to helping them transition into an AI-enabled world, \"where they benefit from it and don't become victims of it,\" he said.\n\nGrowing the economy sustainably\n\nWhether it's accelerating the EV transition, embedding circularity in business models, or reimagining tourism to deliver shared prosperity, sustainability is becoming a larger factor in how industries in Southeast Asia are evolving. Conversations at the summit underscored a shared challenge: how to align policy, investment and innovation to balance economic growth with environmental responsibility.\n\nWhen Indonesia singer and actress Maudy Ayunda co-founded her skin care line From This Island two years ago, she made a decision to return a portion of the revenue of her hero products back to the communities in which they were sourced. But she is also making sure she is not just sourcing, but innovating from Indonesia, she said.\n\n\"It has always historically been known as a place of laborers or raw materials suppliers,\" she said. \"And I wanted to tell a different story with From This Island. I wanted Indonesia to have a stronger voice in terms of innovation and science and technology, so we are investing in R&D to develop extraction methods that lead to much more powerful skin care effects.\"\n\nRecently, electric vehicles (EVs) have become more popular in the region: They pollute less, and they don't need to be fueled by large quantities of imported gas and oil. Both Yinson Holdings Berhad, based in Malaysia, and ACMobility in the Philippines, are betting on EVs as the transportation of choice for the rising middle class. And so, both companies are working to create a more affordable EV infrastructure across the region. And to do so, said\n\nJaime Alfonso Zobel de Ayala, CEO of ACMobility, \"we needed to participate in all parts of the lifecycle of the vehicle.\"\n\nThis includes parts, like batteries as well as repairs and maintenance. And it also includes providing services for drivers. For instance, to allay fears of range anxiety - that the batteries will die before they get drivers to where they need to go - both companies have been instrumental in installing networks of charging stations throughout their home countries.\n\nTwo years ago, Ayala said, the penetration rate of EVs in the Philippines was 1%, but it's since risen to 4% to 6%. \"We're hoping to cross the 50% threshold over the next five years,\" he said.\n\nFostering regional cooperation always pays off\n\nAs the region's economy continues to grow, ASEAN countries have recognized the growing importance of working together, from an ASEAN Tourism Sectoral Plan scheduled to launch in January to allow easier travel around the region to an ASEAN-Australia cyber dialogue started earlier this year.\n\nCybercriminals don't acknowledge borders, so cybersecurity is a prime area for cross-border collaboration. \"These issues impact every one us, and it's going to take every one of us to get after it,\" said Michelle McGuinness, Australia's national cybersecurity coordinator. \"No one sector, no one nation is going to be able to deal with it on their own. The cost of cybercrime, the intrusions, the insecurities, the vulnerabilities that it causes is, we are all in this together.\"\n\nRegional efforts have also expanded to include private companies. For example, over the past 30 years, governments in Southeast Asia have been collaborating on the ASEAN Power Grid, a major project that provides seven and a half gigawatts of power interconnections in the region.\n\n\"It's about economic integration,\" said Winfried Wicklein, director general of the Southeast Asia department of the Asian Development Bank. \"It captures the imagination, and you can see that when ASEAN energy ministers come together.\"\n\nThe collective goal is to double the power of the ASEAN Power Grid over the next 15 years to bring more people online - broadband coverage in some rural areas lags by as much as 30% - and accommodate more digital technology, including AI. But to achieve that ambition, Wicklein said, governments will have to work with private enterprise. ADB has joined forces with the World Bank on the ASEAN Power Grid Financing Initiative, which will bring together the governments, the investors, the sponsors, and the financiers. ADB has already committed $10 billion to the project.\n\n\"We used to be measured by how much we lend for impact,\" Wicklein said. \"Now, increasingly, we really get measured by how much we mobilize for impact.\"\n\nFollow along Mastercard's journey to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere.\n\nView original content here.\n\nAbout Mastercard\n\nMastercard powers economies and empowers people in 200+ countries and territories worldwide.

The S&P 500 has climbed 16% over the same period, while the broader industry has slipped 6.5%. Even Visa Inc. V (up 4.4%) and Mastercard Incorporated MA (up 3.6%), typically consistent outperformers, have trailed far behind.\n\nPrice Performance \u2013 AXP, V, MA, Industry & S&P 500Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis divergence speaks to the resilience of AmEx\u2019s premium brand. Through a choppy macro backdrop, AmEx\u2019s affluent, high-spending clientele and dependable earnings engine have helped it sidestep much of the volatility seen across consumer and financial stocks. As one of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s longest-held positions, the company continues to carry the reputation of a reliable, blue-chip compounder. Still, investors are asking the natural question: after such a strong run, is there meaningful upside left?\n\nA Valuation Edge That Stands Out\n\nOne of AmEx\u2019s key strengths right now is its valuation setup. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 20.67X, comfortably below the industry average of 24.19X. Meanwhile, Visa and Mastercard command far richer premiums, with forward P/E ratios of 25.32X and 29.12X, respectively.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Makes AmEx Different?\n\nAmEx is often grouped with Visa and Mastercard, but its business model functions very differently. The company operates a closed-loop system, meaning it acts as both card issuer and bank. Unlike the pure-network models of Visa and Mastercard, AmEx earns revenues from transaction fees and interest on cardholder balances.\n\nThis dual-revenue structure gives AmEx more flexibility in shifting rate environments. It also strengthens customer relationships, since the company controls the entire payment chain end-to-end. That advantage showed up in recent results: third-quarter revenues, net of interest expense, reached $18.4 billion, up 11% year over year.\n\nIts client base is also a stabilizing asset. While many households are pulling back due to inflation and tighter borrowing standards, AmEx\u2019s affluent users continue spending on travel, dining, entertainment and lifestyle perks. That durability appeared in the numbers: network volumes rose 9% to $479.2 billion in the third quarter, fueled by steady U.S. consumer activity.\n\nManagement recently highlighted at the KBW Fintech Payments Conference that AmEx serves a demographic distinct from the typical Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) user. Rather than viewing BNPL services as direct rivals, the company sees them as complementary tools that cater to different spending tiers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne metric that truly sets AmEx apart is its return on equity of 33.4%, more than double the industry average of 16.2%. This reflects the efficiency and pricing power embedded in its model.\n\nAmEx\u2019s Estimates Move in the Right Direction\n\nAnalysts have become increasingly optimistic. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now indicates 2025 earnings growth of 15.1%, followed by another 14.1% rise in 2026. Revenue estimates for those years point to expansions of 9.3% and 8.3%, respectively, signaling broad-based momentum.\n\nUpward revisions have dominated recent analyst activity, with no downward estimate changes recorded in the past month. AmEx has also beaten earnings expectations for four consecutive quarters, generating an average surprise of 4%.\n\nAmerican Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAmerican Express Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | American Express Company Quote\n\nAmEx\u2019s Balance Sheet Strength Drives Flexibility\n\nBecause AmEx takes on lending and credit risk directly, its balance sheet is a central component of its strategy. The company ended the third quarter with $54.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and only $1.4 billion in short-term debt. Total assets increased to $297.66 billion, up from $271.5 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nIts net debt-to-capital ratio sits at just 4.9%, far below the industry average of 15.3%. This conservative structure enables AmEx to support cardholder loans, withstand credit cycles, meet regulatory needs and still return meaningful capital to shareholders.\n\nIn 2024, AmEx returned $7.9 billion through dividends and buybacks. In the third quarter of 2025 alone, the company distributed $2.9 billion.\n\nAmEx\u2019s Risks Worth Watching\n\nDespite its many strengths, AmEx is not without vulnerabilities. The company\u2019s heavy exposure to travel and entertainment spending can become a liability in economic downturns, as these categories weaken faster than essentials. Recent growth has also benefited from younger customers, Millennials and Gen Z, who tend to spend more selectively and may pull back if conditions worsen.\n\nAmEx\u2019s geographic base is another consideration. Visa and Mastercard have aggressively expanded global digital payment ecosystems, while AmEx remains comparatively domestically focused. Its dependence on lending and card volumes may also limit its ability to adapt to emerging non-card payment systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmerican Express has delivered an impressive year so far, driven by its premium customer base, strong financial discipline and differentiated closed-loop model. The company\u2019s solid revenue momentum, consistent earnings beats and upward-trending estimates underscore the durability of its franchise, even as the broader payments landscape evolves. Its valuation remains appealing relative to major peers, and its strong balance sheet provides the flexibility to navigate credit cycles while rewarding shareholders.\n\nThat said, the stock is not without risks. AmEx\u2019s heavier reliance on travel and discretionary spending, along with its more U.S.-centric footprint, introduces sensitivity to economic slowdowns and shifting consumer trends. These factors limit near-term visibility compared with the globally scaled, asset-light networks of Visa and Mastercard.\n\nBalancing its strengths with its exposure to cyclical categories, AXP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), supported by rising earnings estimates, robust profitability and sound capital management.
