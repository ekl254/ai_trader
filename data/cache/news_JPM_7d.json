JP Morgan circulated the analysis in a research note.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan warns of MicroStrategy delisting risk from major equity indices\n\nWithin hours, prominent Bitcoin supporters, analysts and influencers began calling for a \u201cfull boycott\u201d of JPMorgan.\n\nSeveral others linked the move to historic episodes where U.S. regulators and major banks allegedly cut off crypto firms from banking rails under the now-infamous \u201cOperation Chokepoint.\u201d\n\nA long and troubled history\n\nSince 2017, users, miners and executives have repeatedly reported sudden account closures, compliance flags and what they describe as discriminatory treatment.\n\nThose fears intensified in 2020\u20132022, when the term \u201cOperation Chokepoint 2.0\u201d emerged, a label the crypto industry used to describe what they believed was a coordinated effort by federal regulators and banks to deny services to crypto businesses.\n\nRelated: 'First crypto president' Trump claims credit for ending Operation Choke Point 2.0\n\nThe original Operation Chokepoint (1.0) occurred under the Obama administration between 2013\u20132017 and targeted industries considered \u201chigh-risk,\u201d including payday lenders, firearms sellers and gambling platforms. Crypto leaders argue the same playbook was dusted off for their industry a decade later.\n\nDonald Trump appeared to acknowledge the problem himself in June 2025, saying:\n\n\u201cI can tell you, because I\u2019ve been a victim myself because of my politics, that big banks were very nasty to us.\u201d\n\nHe later signed an executive order prohibiting debanking of crypto initiatives, but this week\u2019s events have reignited concerns that the practice never truly ended.\n\nMore News:\n\nHouse considers insider trading ban as government shutdown comes to an end Billionaire twins\u2013backed stock surges 100% after buying $50M \u2018encrypted Bitcoin\u2019 MicroStrategy stock drops 60% from peak as mNAV approaches 1\n\nStrike CEO says, \u2018thrown out of the bank\u2019\n\nThe fuse was relit when Strike CEO Jack Mallers revealed on Nov. 23 that JPMorgan had abruptly terminated his accounts in September:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cLast month, J.P.

Just checking.\u201d\n\nA threat to crypto-treasury companies\n\nThe bigger explosion, however, came from MSCI\u2019s proposed rule change, first mentioned in a JPMorgan research note circulated this week.\n\nMSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) creates and maintains some of the most important equity benchmarks globally, including the MSCI USA Index, which tracks 85% of the American stock market. Many pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and ETFs must track these indices.\n\nThus, inclusion equals inflows, and exclusion equals forced selling.\n\nMSCI is now weighing a new rule. Companies holding 50% or more of their total assets in crypto may be ineligible for index inclusion.\n\nRelated: MSCI delisting shock erases 45% of crypto-treasury value\n\nThe rule is aimed directly at \u201cdigital asset treasury companies\u201d, especially Strategy, which holds 649,870 BTC on its balance sheet.\n\nJPMorgan wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy is at risk of exclusion from major equity indices as the January 15th MSCI decision approaches.\u201d\n\nThe bank added:\n\n\u201cOutflows could amount to $2.8 billion if MicroStrategy gets excluded from MSCI indices and $8.8 billion from all other equity indices if other providers choose to follow.\u201d\n\nMore from TheStreet Roundtable:\n\nFlorida launches major probe into JPMorgan amid fresh 'debanking' claims Polymarket services restored after brief downtime 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' author warns of \u2018The Big Print\u2019 as \u2018fake money crashes\u2019\n\nCrypto calls for boycott erupt\n\nBitcoin supporters called for a complete boycott of JPMorgan and its services.\n\nReal estate investor and Bitcoin advocate Grant Cardone wrote, \u201cI just pulled $20 million from Chase and suing them for credit card malfeasance.\u201dReal estate investor and Bitcoin advocate Grant Cardone calls for a boycott of JPMorgan after the MSCI-crypto controversy, urging followers to \u201cclose your account\u201d and \u201cmove your money.\u201d (Source: Grant Cardone / X)\n\nSeveral others like\u00a0long-time Bitcoin maximalist and advisor to El Salvador, Max Keiser also shared 'boycott' screenshots.\n\nTogether, the posts fueled a viral online movement calling for a boycott of JPMorgan, with tens of thousands of engagements across X.\n\nStrategy\u2019s Saylor breaks silence: \u2018We are not a fund\u2019\n\nOn Nov. 21, Strategy founder Michael Saylor issued a sharp response to MSCI\u2019s proposed rules:\n\n\u201cStrategy is not a fund, not a trust, and not a holding company. We\u2019re a publicly traded operating company with a $500 million software business and a unique treasury strategy that uses Bitcoin as productive capital.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cFunds and trusts passively hold assets.

The company\u2019s returns over the past year were driven by continued operational strength amid cost concerns and a weak asset quality. Business expansion efforts, loan demand and changes in interest rates will aid net interest income (NII) growth.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst projects\u2019 NII to witness a CAGR of 3.3% by 2027. In investment banking (IB), the company\u2019s solid pipeline and market leadership remain competitive strengths, though capital markets volatility and elevated mortgage rates are likely to weigh on fee income.\r\n\r\nOur estimates for non-interest income don\u2019t show a favorable trend this year. Technology and marketing investments will keep costs elevated. The Zacks analyst expect expenses to reflect a CAGR of 4.4% by 2027. A tough macro backdrop raises concerns about asset quality. We expect provisions to rise 10.5% in 2025.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\r\n\r\nNetflix\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the year-to-date period (+18.9% vs. -59.6%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention.\r\n\r\nNFLX's advertising tier now accounts for more than 55% of new sign-ups in available markets. NFLX has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, supported by a diversified content strategy, including international programming, live events, and gaming initiatives.\r\n\r\nNFLX raised its full-year free cash flow forecast to $9 billion from $8-8.5 billion. For the fourth-quarter, Netflix projects $11.96 billion in revenue with 16.7% growth and a 23.9% operating margin, featuring major releases including Stranger Things' final season and NFL Christmas games.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of AbbVie have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+34.9% vs. +17.9%). The company beats third-quarter estimates for both earnings and sales. AbbVie has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity (LOE) by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications. These should support top-line growth in the next few years.\r\n\r\nAbbVie is returning to robust revenue growth in 2025, which is just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE. It has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years to bolster its early-stage pipeline that should drive long-term growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company faces several headwinds like Humira LOE impact, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and continued macro headwinds for Aesthetics.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\r\n\r\nOhio Valley Banc\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry over the year-to-date period (+62.5% vs. -1.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $166.30 million is expanding its NIM by reallocating toward higher-yielding commercial and real estate loans and relying on stable, low-cost subsidized deposits that support spread performance.\r\n\r\nTargeted, higher-quality loan growth combined with steady fee income continues to reinforce earnings, while efficiency gains from recent cost-management actions and disciplined capital returns help strengthen overall profitability. Credit metrics remain generally stable. Yet, rising provisioning needs, increased collateral-dependent balances, and reliance on subsidized public deposits introduce added macro sensitivity.\r\n\r\nLoan growth momentum and buyback execution continue to trail peers, tempering near-term confidence. The valuation suggests investors are paying a discounted price for a bank with improving profitability, but balance-sheet and growth risks warrant caution.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Ohio Valley Banc here >>>)\n\nStory Continues\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Historical headwinds, such as the astronomical price-to-sales ratios of quantum computing stocks, are front and center for investors.  However, the most significant risk for pure-play quantum computing stocks comes from a group of \"magnificent\" companies that are flush with cash and craving large addressable opportunities.10 stocks we like better than IonQ \u203a\n\nOver the last three years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the primary catalyst driving Wall Street's major stock indexes to record highs. But in 2025, it's taken a back seat to a technology that's produced truly jaw-dropping gains.\n\nOver the trailing year, as of the closing bell on Nov. 19, quantum computing pure-play stocksIonQ(NYSE: IONQ), Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT) have delivered respective returns of 90%, 1,860%, 1,530%, and 385%. For comparison, the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite has rallied 20% over the trailing year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nGains of this magnitude imply that investor hype surrounding quantum computing is tangible and may not fade anytime soon. While there are viable reasons to be excited about the real-world applications of Wall Street's hottest innovation, the biggest risk of all to this quartet of quantum computing stocks has gone virtually undetected by the investing populace.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did quantum computing stocks go parabolic in 2025?\n\nIn simple terms, quantum computing involves the use of specialized computers that can make rapid, simultaneous calculations at a considerably faster pace than the world's quickest supercomputers. Quantum computers are capable of tackling complex problems that classical computers are ill-equipped to handle.\n\nOne example of the real-world utility of quantum computers is their ability to speed up the real-time processing and learning capabilities of AI algorithms. Split-second decision-making is particularly important for AI software and systems.\n\nInvestors have also been enamored with the high ceiling for quantum computing hardware and services. Boston Consulting Group estimates this technology can add $450 billion to $850 billion to the global economy by 2040. Meanwhile, online publication The Quantum Insider is looking for this worldwide economic impact to reach the $1 trillion plateau by 2035.\n\nBut if there's one tangible factor that's really lit a fire under the shares of IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. in recent months, it's the prospect of brand-name collaborations.\n\nFor instance, \"Magnificent Seven\" members Amazon and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are both giving their respective quantum-cloud service subscribers access to IonQ's and Rigetti's quantum computers. Amazon's Braket and Microsoft's Azure Quantum can allow clients to run simulations and test their quantum computing hardware.\n\nAdditionally, quantum computing pure-play stocks soared following an Oct. 13 announcement from banking giant JPMorgan Chase that it plans to make direct equity and venture capital investments in 27 \"sub-areas.\" Quantum computing was one of these 27 investment targets identified by JPMorgan's initial research.\n\nAlthough everything would seem to be going swimmingly for quantum computing pure-play stocks, their parabolic ascent may prove fleeting.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis under-the-radar risk threatens to wipe out the first-mover advantage of pure-play stocks\n\nHistory tells us there are several reasons to be skeptical of the supercharged returns for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc.\n\nTo begin with, every hyped technology and game-changing innovation since the arrival of the internet in the mid-1990s has eventually navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly an innovation or trend would earn widespread adoption, gain utility, and/or be optimized. This eventually leads to lofty investor expectations not being met.\n\nQuantum computing is still in the very early stages of commercialization, which exposes it to a high risk of a bubble-bursting event.\n\nFurthermore, quantum computing stock valuations are otherworldly. Whereas price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 in market-leading businesses have historically alerted investors to potential stock market bubbles, the forward-year P/S ratios for IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. are many multiples above this historical mark.\n\nBut there's an even bigger risk to these four quantum computing stocks that virtually everyone is missing. Namely, some of their leading clients could become their top competitors in the years to come.\n\nWith the exception of electric-vehicle maker Tesla, whose operating cash flow has fluctuated in recent quarters, the other six members of the Magnificent Seven are flush with capital and generating more cash flow from their operating activities than they often know what to do with. When a game-changing innovation emerges with an eye-popping addressable market, companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)seize the opportunity.\n\nIn December 2024, Alphabet introduced the world to Willow, the company's latest quantum processing unit (QPU). Last month (October), Alphabet reported that Willow oversaw calculations that were approximately 13,000 times faster than the fastest classical supercomputers on the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, in February, Microsoft announced the arrival of Majorana 1, which is its take on a QPU. Microsoft claims that Majorana 1 is designed to scale to 1 million qubits, which is expected to significantly minimize errors while ensuring calculations that are considerably faster than those of classical computers.\n\nThe point being that we're already observing some of Wall Street's most influential, profitable, and cash-rich businesses encroaching on an industry where the first-mover advantage for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc. may be precarious, at best. Although IonQ recently completed a $2 billion equity offering, the funding situation for most pure-play quantum computing stocks remains uncertain. Trying to compete against the likes of Alphabet or Microsoft with no foundational operating segment and ongoing cash outflows is a recipe for disaster.\n\nWhile several headwinds exist for quantum computing pure-play stocks, internal competition from members of the Magnificent Seven represents the most significant risk to their success -- and perhaps even their survival.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

It comes as JPMorgan sided with entities calling for MSTR delisting from MSCI USA and Nasdaq 100 amid over 50% Bitcoin holdings of Strategy.\n\nBitcoin advocates have called for a boycott of JPMorgan due to its continuous attacks on Bitcoin by the bank and CEO Jamie Dimon, sparking crypto debanking risks. Notably, the latest warning has driven significant institutional outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nMax Keiser shared that JPMorgan appears to have opened short positions on MSTR. If MSTR stock recovers, the bank would face heavy losses. Notably, the filings with the US SEC disclosed that the bank reduced its shareholdings by almost 25% last quarter.\n\nBanking Giant Faces Account Closures\n\nHuge numbers of users, which include hedge funds and industrialists, are reportedly closing their bank accounts as part of the JPMorgan boycott. Many have expressed support for Strategy amid delisting risks, with Michael Saylor committing to buying Bitcoin despite the potential delisting jitters.\n\nEquity fund manager and real estate investor Grant Cardone closed his JPMorgan account and shifted entire account to Wells Fargo. Also, he warned followers to avoid Chase credit cards due to fraud concerns.\n\nStrike and Twenty One Capital CEO Jack Mallers revealed that the bank closed his account without warning.

Strategy has raised over $20B through convertible notes since 2020. Its average acquisition cost sits at $74,433 per Bitcoin. versus today\u2019s $86,700. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), the former business-intelligence software maker turned Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) holding company, now owns 649,870 bitcoin worth roughly $56 billion at today\u2019s price around $86,700. That\u2019s around 3% of all Bitcoin ever mined and far exceeds the company\u2019s $500 million annual software revenue. Since 2020, executive chairman Michael Saylor has treated Bitcoin as the company's primary treasury asset, raising billions in convertible debt and equity to keep buying on every dip.\n\nMSCI's Sword Hanging Over MSTR\n\nOn January 15, 2026, index giant MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) will decide whether companies whose main asset is cryptocurrency -- so-called \u201cdigital asset treasury\u201d firms -- can stay in major benchmarks like the MSCI USA and MSCI World. Strategy is the most prominent large-cap company that currently fails the proposed rules: Bitcoin makes up over 90% of its total assets and dwarfs operating cash flow.\n\nIf MSCI kicks Strategy out, passive funds tracking those indices would be forced to sell. JPMorgan estimates an immediate $2.8 billion of outflows, with a potential total of $8 billion to $9 billion if the Nasdaq 100 follows suit. That mechanical selling could impact Strategy's stock price, pushing it far below net asset value (NAV).\n\nMSTR's Debt Stack Keeps Growing\n\nStrategy has raised more than $20 billion through zero- or low-coupon convertible notes since 2020, including:\n\n$2 billion 0% notes due 2030 (issued February 2025) $1.75 billion 0.625% notes due 2028 Multiple smaller offerings maturing as soon as December 2025\n\nThese notes are convertible at premiums of 35% to 55% to the current stock price, giving bondholders cheap upside while Strategy gets near-free capital. The strategy works as long as Bitcoin keeps rising and the stock trades at a premium to its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nWhen Bitcoin fell from $109,000 in late 2024 to $80,700 this past Friday, the market-cap-to-Bitcoin-held ratio collapsed from 2.5\u00d7 to roughly 1.1\u00d7, making new raises harder and more dilutive.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBreak-Even Math Is Still Comfortable -- For Now\n\nAverage acquisition cost sits at $74,433 per Bitcoin. At $86,700, Strategy has an unrealized gain of 16.5%, or $12 billion. A drop below $70,000, however, would wipe out paper profits and force the company to post additional collateral on some debt facilities or face margin pressure.\n\nIn Strategy's third quarter earnings call, CFO Andrew Kang countered that the company has \u201cmultiple levers\u201d to manage liquidity, including at-the-market equity issuance and new preferred stock series (STRK 8%, STRF 10%), suggesting any fallout would be limited.\n\nWhat Happens After January 15?\n\nThe best case scenario for Strategy is that MSCI grandfathers Strategy in or delays any changes. Passive inflows could resume, the premium re-expands, and the Bitcoin buying machine restarts.\n\nThe base case is that Strategy is excluded, which would trigger forced selling, likely causing the stock to trade closer to 0.8x to 0.9x NAV for months and making it more expensive for the company to raise new capital.\n\nFor Strategy, the worst case scenario is sustained Bitcoin weakness below $70,000 that coincides with exclusion, creating a feedback loop of selling and dilution that impairs the ability to hold all 649,870 BTC long-term.\n\nBroader Context in Late 2025\n\nCorporate Bitcoin adoption is continuing.

Current low-rate mortgages are causing a \"locked-in\" effect. Housing affordability remains a significant challenge, especially for first-time buyers. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nIt's a good question, and the fact that it resonates reveals a lot about the U.S. housing market and its prospects for recovery. Here's a look at why both matter, and what the housing market needs right now.\n\n3% mortgage rates?\n\nUnfortunately, it's unlikely to happen for a while. For an idea of what the markets think, or instead, the bond markets think, here's a look at long-term U.S. Treasury yields and the 30-year mortgage rate.\n\nMortgage rates tend to trade at higher yields to reflect the greater risk of lending to homeowners compared to lending to the U.S. Treasury. Interpolating the chart below, the 10-year Treasury yield will have to decrease to approximately 1.5%, on the most optimistic assumption, for 30-year mortgages to return to 3%.30 Year Mortgage Rate data by YCharts\n\nThat doesn't look likely anytime soon, according to another useful indicator of what the bond market is thinking about inflation. The 10-Year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) is a bond whose principal value is adjusted according to the inflation rate. It follows that we can subtract its yield from the 10-year Treasury yield to get the market's view on where inflation will be in 10 years. This is known as the 10-Year TIPS/Treasury Breakeven Rate.\n\nAs you can see below, the market is pricing in long-term inflation of 2.27%. Again, based on this, the usual spread to the 10-year yield, and another spread to the 30-year mortgage yield, it's tough to see 3% mortgage rates in the near future.10 Year TIPS/Treasury Breakeven Rate data by YCharts\n\nWhat about real mortgage rates?\n\nAnother way to look at matters is to look at real mortgage rates, in other words, adjusted for inflation. We can do this by comparing current mortgage rates to the break-even inflation rate (in this case, the 30-year break-even inflation rate). This is useful because it helps adjust mortgage rates for inflation. Whichever way you look at it, mortgage rates are unlikely to drop to 3% anytime soon.Data source: Freddie Mac, Federal Reserve. Chart by author.\n\nWhy the question matters so much\n\nThe fact that the question matters is, in itself, highly illuminating of current housing market dynamics. According to JPMorgan research, \"half of current U.S. mortgage borrowers are still enjoying sub-4% rates and about 80% are paying under 6%.\" These relatively low rates are creating a so-called \"locked-in\" effect, in which homeowners are reluctant to sell their properties because they know they will have to pay a higher rate given current mortgage rates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis reluctance to sell is buoying house prices and creating a pincer movement of rising housing prices and rising mortgage rates, which is reducing housing affordability, notably so for first-time buyers. The housing affordability index is the ratio of the median family income to the qualifying income necessary to obtain a mortgage on the median-priced home.\n\nTherefore, an index of 100 indicates that the average family has just enough income to meet the average mortgage, and a number below 100 indicates that they do not. As such, a lower housing affordability index means housing is less affordable for the average income earner.US First Time Buyer Housing Affordability Index data by YCharts\n\nJPMorgan estimates a 2.8 million shortage of housing units in the U.S., and the best solution to the problems of housing affordability and availability lies in a gradual reduction in rates and a concomitant rise in housing starts. That's happening, but at a slower pace than many had expected previously, and 3% mortgages aren't likely to be part of the mix for some time to come.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Wells Fargo, Chase and Bank of America offer entry-level rates of 0.01% on these deposits.\n\nGiven that the Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rates are between 3.75% and 4.00%, bank deposit rates certainly appear like a bad deal.\n\nThe national average savings rate is just 4.6% as of August 2025, while the rate of inflation sits at 3.0%. No matter how you look at it, it seems the value of your money is shrinking over time.\n\nA survey of 8.3 million Chase customers by JP Morgan found that the median cash balance in a checking account was around $6,600 depending on income bracket, as of February 2024. That\u2019s a lot of money in aggregate that isn\u2019t earning much interest.\n\nTo be fair, these checking accounts are not designed for capital appreciation. Account holders generally use this cash for daily transactions and short-term needs, such as rent and utilities.\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts currently offer interest rates as high as 4.21% in some instances, according to data from Bankrate.\n\nHowever, Cardone argued that people are either unaware of better rates or unwilling to go seek them out. \u201cPeople are unconscious, they don\u2019t know where their money is,\u201d he told Howes.\n\nTrending: Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year \u2014 and he begs investors not to miss its \u2018explosion\u2019\n\n'You can't manage what you can't measure.'\n\nCardone\u2019s financial philosophy echoes the words of management consultant Peter Drucker, who once said, \u201cYou can't manage what you can't measure.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt\u2019s a philosophy that\u2019s baked into modern corporations and professional investment strategies, as they prepare quarterly reports on all their cash flow, assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\n\nFrequently checking your bank account could help you get a better grip on your personal spending habits and cash flow.

Here's what investors should know.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides exposure to many of the most influential companies\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 tracks the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which measures the performance of 500 large U.S. companies. Included in the benchmark index are value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors. The S&P 500 is usually seen as the best gauge for the overall domestic stock market because it covers about 80% of domestic equities by market value.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 also includes approximately 40% of global equities by market value, meaning it provides exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world. Listed below are the top 10 positions in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF:\n\nNvidia: 8.4%Apple: 6.8%Microsoft: 6.5%Alphabet: 5%Amazon: 4%Broadcom: 2.9%Meta Platforms: 2.4%Tesla: 2.1%Berkshire Hathaway: 1.5%JPMorgan Chase: 1.4%\n\nBuffett once bet $500,000 that he could beat a hedge fund with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffett wagered $500,000 that no professional investor could outperform an S&P 500 index fund over an extended period. He even offered to let the contender select five hedge funds. Only one asset manager accepted the challenge: Buffett went head-to-head with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners between 2008 and 2017 -- and Buffett won.\n\nThe best-performing Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 fund returned 88% during that 10-year period, and the worst fund did so poorly that it was dissolved after nine years. Meanwhile, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF returned 126%, meaning Buffett won the competition by 38 percentage points.\n\nThink about that: With nothing but an S&P 500 index fund, Buffett beat 100-plus financial experts (i.e., each of the five funds was run by a different manager, and each manager invested in many other funds run by other professionals). Yet, those financial experts charge clients exorbitant fees for their services, while the S&P 500 has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning shareholders will pay just $3 annually on every $10,000 in the fund.\n\nHow the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF can turn $450 per month into $940,200\n\nThe S&P 500 achieved a total return of 1,820% over the last 30 years. It compounded at 10.3% annually during that period. Those decades include such a wide variety of economic and market conditions -- three recessions, three bear markets, and 13 market corrections -- that investors can reasonably assume similar returns over long periods in the future.\n\nAt that rate, $450 invested monthly in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would be worth $87,300 after one decade, $320,000 after two decades, and $940,200 after three decades, provided dividends are reinvested.\n\nHere's the bottom line: The S&P 500 has consistently produced stellar returns, such that professionals often struggle to beat the index. That makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF a good option for almost every investor, even those who prefer individual stocks. You are unlikely to find an index fund with a lower expense ratio and a better track record.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

But its controlled businesses are arguably even more valuable. The crown jewel is its property and casualty insurance businesses. Given Berkshire's expertise in finding value in the financial sector, it's no surprise that it owns all three of the major credit card companies -- American Express, Visa, and Mastercard.\n\nVisa is the largest of the three, both in terms of market capitalization and transaction volume. The more cards that enter the Visa network, the greater the incentive for merchants worldwide to accept Visa, which boosts revenue that can be used to partner with even more financial institutions, in turn leading to more card issuances. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Visa is converting nearly half of its revenue into free cash flow (FCF) -- which showcases just how efficiently its business operates.\n\nV Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nVisa's main expenses are related to maintaining and expanding its network, labor, and marketing. It's a very capital-light business model, especially considering that Visa partners with financial institutions to issue cards. By not issuing its own cards, Visa doesn't have to worry about bearing the credit risk. So it's not liable for how responsibly or irresponsibly its card users manage their spending.\n\nAnother benefit is that it doesn't have to pay its users rewards. That's also done by financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase's Chase Sapphire and Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Bank of America Customer Cash Rewards card, or the Wells Fargo Active Cash card, which are all Visa cards. By comparison, American Express spends more than double on cardmember perks than it collects in annual fees (but it makes up for that shortfall in other ways).\n\nVisa passes along its free cash flow to shareholders\n\nVisa's high-margin business makes it arguably the greatest cash cow in the financial services industry.\n\nBecause Visa has low capital expenditures, it is able to convert nearly all of its operating cash flow into FCF. Visa returns that FCF to shareholders through dividends and more, importantly, stock buybacks. Metric Full Year Fiscal 2025 Net cash provided by operating activities $23.06 billion Capital expenditures $1.48 billion Free cash flow $21.58 billion Share repurchases $18.19 billion Dividends $4.63 billion\n\nData source: Visa. Fiscal year 2025 ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn Visa's 2025 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2025, the company returned roughly 4 times more cash through stock buybacks than dividends. Here lies Visa's ace in the hole. By using its FCF on buybacks over dividends, Visa consistently reduces its share count. With fewer shares to go around, Visa's earnings per share increase from the core business growing earnings as well as through a lower outstanding share count.\n\nBuybacks are a significant reason why Visa is still a good value. Despite Visa's stock price increasing over fourfold in the last decade, Visa's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still just 32.3 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is lower than its 10-year median P/E of 34.3.\n\nIf Visa were to reallocate share repurchases toward dividends, it would yield a whopping 3.6% instead of its actual yield of 0.8%. However, long-term investors would prefer Visa to continue buying back stock disproportionately and paying a relatively small dividend, as it's a better use of capital if the stock continues to perform well.\n\nYou can count on Visa in 2026 and beyond\n\nVisa checks all the boxes of a high-quality stock to buy now. Major indexes, such as the S&P 500, sport relatively expensive valuations because many of the largest companies by market capitalization have seen their stock prices rise faster than earnings, which puts pressure on these companies to deliver on expectations.\n\nVisa doesn't have that problem because its valuation is reasonable. And yet, it's not a stodgy, low-growth stock like Coca-Cola, where investors can only pencil in mid-single-digit annual earnings growth. Visa should continue to grow earnings in the low double digits per year, even if consumer spending declines.\n\nAdd it all up, and Visa is one of my highest-conviction buys for 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

This reflects a modest increase in the projected fair value of the bank's shares. Discount Rate has inched up from 10.8% to 10.9%. This indicates a marginal adjustment in the perceived risk profile. Revenue Growth expectations have climbed from 4.39% to 4.52%. This suggests modestly stronger future growth anticipated by analysts. Net Profit Margin has dipped marginally from 43.95% to 43.83%. This signals a slight reduction in expected profitability. Future P/E ratio estimate has edged up from 12.82x to 12.88x.

Week 44 made strong strides toward making the American Dream possible for more Americans. Despite Democrat lawmakers attempting to derail and disrupt, the economy showed strong improvement and a good indicator of that is surge in first time home buyers. HUD Secretary Turner announced that one million Americans bought their first home this year. Economists were please to report that 119,000 new jobs were added in September, more than doubling expectations and consumer spending was very strong with more people paying their bills on time. 11 mega companies are breaking ground to build brand new factories in America, which will also build their own power plants, and they are hiring American workers to build them. The cost of Thanksgiving meal is nearly 14% more affordable this year for the upcoming holiday and the national average price of gasoline is down heading into the Thanksgiving holiday. The current National Average is $3.02 per gallon.\n\nIn the article, Transportation Secretary Duffy Announced that 776 patriotic men and women Air Traffic Controllers and Technicians get $10,000 bonuses for not leaving their jobs during the government shutdown. 2026 Income taxes are expected to be the lowest ever with taxpayers taking home an extra $91 Billion in refunds and an additional $30 Billion in their paychecks from reduced withholdings next year, with car loan interest deductions, no tax on tips, overtime or social security income. Toyota announced a $912 Million investment in American manufacturing. The Trump Administration is setting the goal to be the leader in chip making by way of 50% of the chips used in America will be made in America. Pharmaceutical company Novartis announced that it is building a new manufacturing hub in North Carolina which will create 700 new manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe article shows President Trumps visit from the Saudi Prince, Mohammed Bin Salmon to strengthen bonds and further business pursuits. Prince MBS announced that he was increasing his investment in the United States from $600 Billion to a record-breaking $1 Trillion, with $270 billion in immediate deals, all creating tens of thousands of high-paying American jobs. Also attending was pro-football player Christiano Ronaldo, who plays for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Pro League (backed by the kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund.) He was a surprise guest but not officially part of the delegation.\n\nThe article covers the many investigations this week with the FBI announcing that the investigation into the assassination attempt on President Trump\u2019s life has shown that shooter Thomas Crooks acted alone. A Member of Congress was charged by the DoJ for money-laundering FEMA funds and the acting head of FEMA resigned. The FBI and Florida AG James Uthmeier announced that 122 missing children were recovered across 10 states, ages 23 months to 17 years old. From aboard the USCG Cutter Stone at Port Everglades, DNI Tulsi Gabbard announced the offload of 49,000 lbs of illicit cocaine, worth more than $362 Million. Please support these incredible Joint Task Force Operations that are collaborating services at all levels across all states to take down trafficking rings and networks and rescue missing, exploited and abused children. It is important that our Representatives support these efforts to protect children. We need better laws to keep children safe, so please call your Representatives about all of this, because America has run out of tolerance for child predators and criminal trafficking.\n\nIn ThinkCareBelieve\u2019s article, President Trump signed the Jeffrey Epstein Transparency Act this week and chaos ensued with Democratic leaders making accusations and a reckless video suggesting that the military disobey orders from their Commander-in-Chief. From the first batch of documents released, there were emails between democrat leaders and Jeffrey Epstein and records of Jeffrey Epstein texting with a Democrat Congresswoman coaching her to go after President Trump in her questioning during a Congressional Committee Hearing. The documents also exposed JP Morgan Chase for being involved in bank transfers for Epstein\u2019s operation. Larry Summers has resigned from OpenAI\u2019s and Harvard\u2019s boards after being linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The Democrat video is being seen as a very strange reaction and Deputy AG Todd Blanche stated that there needs to be an investigation. Newsmax\u2019s Carl Higbie, a former U.S. Navy Seal had this to say, \u201cStuff like this gets people killed. It creates stupid rules of engagement, some of which killed my friends personally, because they want to play political grandstand games with no intention of backing the soldier up when he does the bidding that they subtly encouraged.\u201d Later that night, a fire broke out underneath the Capitol where the underground railcar transport system is. Evacuations occurred.\n\nThe article highlights that true to his promise to return educational authority back to the states, President Trump signed an Executive Order to shut down the Department of Education. The government shutdown proved just how little the DoE was needed and it was really just a pass-through for funds that will be better served by the states.\n\nThe article covers the United Nations approval of President Trump\u2019s 20-Point Peace Plan for Israel and Gaza and President Putin announced that President Trump\u2019s 28-Point Peace Plan will serve as a foundation for the final settlement of the Ukrainian Conflict. These are two unique plans but they build on one another. In the Middle East, there will be a \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d and in Russia~Ukraine, there will be a \u201cPeace Council\u201d to support peace-keeping efforts. This week, President Trump hosted the freed Israel hostages. \u201cYou\u2019re not a hostage anymore. Today you\u2019re heroes.\u201d\n\nWeek 44 made solid progress toward clearing the way for the American Dream to occur. It is something worth building together in shared vision and productive collaboration. In the words of our first Lady, \u201cAs we give thanks this season, let us remember what unites us \u2013 our shared love of country, our faith in one another, and our pride in those who serve.\u201d\n\nThank you to all who are working so hard for our Golden Future!\n\nThinkCareBelieve is an outlook. ThinkCareBelieve\u2019s mission for Peace advocacy facilitates positive outcomes and expanded possibilities.

Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on JPMorgan Chase.\n\nWhat Wall Street Has Been Saying\n\nRecent analyst commentary on JPMorgan Chase highlights strong optimism across much of Wall Street, with multiple firms raising their price targets on the stock following JPMorgan\u2019s latest earnings results and updated guidance. However, some neutral ratings also point out ongoing risks to future performance and valuation.\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Bullish Takeaways\n\nGoldman Sachs raised its price target to $366 from $350 and maintained a Buy rating after JPMorgan\u2019s Q3 earnings beat and a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 20.5 percent, which is well above management\u2019s medium-term target. The firm cites robust balance sheet growth and an improved net interest income outlook for 2025 as major positives. UBS also increased its price target to $350 from $339 and kept a Buy rating, emphasizing strong gains across the banking sector, improved capital markets activity, and solid loan growth supporting share price appreciation. Barclays raised its target to $342 from $330 with an Overweight rating, pointing to continued momentum and recent outperformance in earnings. The firm also notes higher expenses moving into 2026. Analysts broadly highlight operational execution and growth momentum as key drivers behind the upward revisions, underscoring JPMorgan\u2019s capacity to outpace earnings expectations and demonstrate resilience even amid sector challenges.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Bearish Takeaways\n\nCiti lifted its price target to $330 and $325 from $275 in separate reports but retained a Neutral rating on the stock. The firm acknowledges JPMorgan\u2019s strong quarter and attributes the target increases to lower cost of equity assumptions, while signaling caution on future upside. Bearish and neutral analysts generally express reservations about valuation and the degree to which future growth prospects are already reflected in the current share price. Concerns remain about higher expense levels as JPMorgan maintains its pace into 2026, as noted by Barclays.\n\nOverall, while the most recent analyst actions reflect a predominantly positive outlook, valuation concerns and expense headwinds mean that not all on Wall Street are unequivocally bullish on JPMorgan Chase at these levels. The mix of targets and ratings suggests confidence in JPMorgan\u2019s execution and growth trajectory, but also recognition that risk and caution are not absent from the conversation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts?

Instead, they have agreed to a smaller, short-term loan solution for the country's pressing financial crisis. The White House is evaluating new rules to limit the power of proxy advisory firms. This initiative is supported by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and other industry leaders who argue these firms have too much influence over shareholder voting. JPMorgan has introduced a $1.5 trillion Security & Resiliency Initiative and has appointed Jay Horine to lead investments in critical U.S. sectors such as defense, energy, and manufacturing.

This marks the Forum's second edition in Europe and the eighth consecutive Global Industry Forum organized by GenScript since its debut at the 2020 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco\u2014highlighting the Forum's continued role in supporting industry exchange and advancing the development of the Cell & Gene Therapy (CGT) sector.2025 GenScript Biotech Global Forum London\n\nUnder the theme \"THE NEXT ERA OF CGT IS HERE,\" attracted nearly 400 participants from around the world, including global scientists, business leaders, and investors such as Nobel Laureate Dr. Craig Mello, who engaged in in-depth discussions on cutting-edge CGT topics, including the transition from ex vivo to in vivo therapies, strategies to overcome CMC challenges in manufacturing, and capital and collaboration trends.\n\nGlobal Leaders Converge on the Next Era of CGT\n\nThe forum was moderated by Dr. Shawn Wu, President of the European Division at GenScript.\n\nSherry Shao, Rotating CEO of GenScript, delivered the opening remarks, stating:\n\n\"Through the combined strength of GenScript Life Science and our subsidiary ProBio, we now offer end-to-end CGT solutions \u2014 from discovery to commercialization. And we are profoundly inspired by milestones like CARVYKTI \u2014 developed by our associate Legend Biotech \u2014 which has now treated over 9,000 patients globally, bringing hope to thousands of families. It stands as a testament to what's possible when science, scale, and spirit align.\"\n\nMs. Shao emphasized that the Forum aims to connect global expertise and foster collaboration among academia, industry, regulators, investors, and ecosystem partners such as CROs and CDMOs, addressing critical challenges and advancing CGT therapies for patients worldwide.\n\nKeynote Insights from Nobel Laureate and Industry Pioneers\n\nThis year's forum featured keynote speeches by Nobel Laureate Dr. Craig Mello, Dr. Carl June, Director of the University of Pennsylvania Center for Cellular Immunotherapy, and Dr. Miguel Forte, President and Board of Directors Chair of the International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy (ISCT). They shared the latest advancements and practical insights in CGT from scientific, industrial, and clinical perspectives, offering strategic guidance for the future of the field.\n\nDr. Craig Mello, who received the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering RNA interference (RNAi), highlighted RNAi's high programmability and therapeutic potential. New oligonucleotides can be quickly generated at low cost and precisely target mature mRNAs, making almost any disease target potentially druggable. He illustrated this with a siRNA therapy for preeclampsia, which stabilized maternal blood pressure with a single subcutaneous injection.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDr. Mello also noted that RNAi can complement cell therapies by modulating key genes to enhance safety and efficacy. Looking ahead, he predicted that RNAi will become a major therapeutic approach, standing alongside CGT in tackling a wide range of diseases.\n\nDr. Carl June, the \"Father of CAR-T,\" gave a comprehensive review of the CAR-T therapy's applications in blood cancers and ongoing research in treating solid tumors.\n\nHe noted that second-generation CAR-T therapies have demonstrated durable responses in blood cancers, and new insights into their persistence are helping guide next-generation product design.\n\nProfessor June also highlighted his team's progress on armored CAR-T programs\u2014such as IL-18 and IL-9 constructs\u2014which are showing encouraging activity in refractory lymphoma and in a pancreatic cancer mouse model. He noted that improving CAR-T infiltration and durability in solid tumors remains a core challenge, while combination strategies with oncolytic viruses are beginning to show promising signals.\n\nDr. Miguel Forte, a versatile leader whose influence spans academia, industry, and regulatory domains, underscored that delivering real benefits to patients requires not only scientific innovation, but also an adequate business model, clinical convenience, and accurate product launch.\n\nDr. Forte pointed out that every therapy must be managed with scientific rigor to appropriately address safety risks. He called on the industry to stay grounded in reality and strike the right balance between enthusiasm and rationality, so that CGT can move from being merely \"possible\" to genuinely \"accessible.\"\n\nIn-Depth Roundtable Discussions Address Industry Pain Points and Future Trends\n\nFour deep-dive roundtable sessions were hosted, covering topics on both technological innovation and commercial strategy.\n\nTraditional ex vivo CAR-T therapies have shown remarkable success in hematologic cancers, but long manufacturing cycles, high complexity, and high costs remain significant barriers. In response, the industry is actively exploring new solutions\u2014most notably in vivo CAR-T, which engineers T cells directly inside the patient, potentially simplifying production and improving accessibility.\n\nDuring the \"Navigating the Future of Cell Therapy: Evaluating Varied Pathways in Cell Therapy Innovation for Comprehensive Sector Insights\" roundtable, Mr. Stephen Hansen, Biopharma Intelligence Director at BioCentury, moderated a vibrant discussion featuring industry leaders: Dr. Ying Huang, CEO of Legend Biotech, Dr. Paul Stoffels, Former CSO at Johnson\u00a0& Johnson and Co-founder/Former CEO-Chair of Galapagos NV, Dr. Paula R\u00edo, Head of the Bone Marrow Aplasia Unit at CIEMAT/CIBERER/IIS-FJD, Dr. Marcello Maresca, Senior Director of the Genome Engineering Department at AstraZeneca, and Dr. Jonathan Esensten, Senior Advisor at Multiply Labs, Director of Advanced Biotherapy Center at Sheba Medical Center.\n\nThe panelists were generally optimistic about the development prospects of in vivo CAR-T therapies. Dr. Ying Huang shared insights into the latest industry trends, highlighting that while many companies worldwide are actively advancing in vivo CAR-T, the therapy still faces challenges such as patient-to-patient variability, immune system reconstitution, and strict GMP regulations and quality control, which remain key hurdles for commercialization.\n\nDr. Jonathan Esensten guided the discussion toward the promising applications of in vivo CAR-T, particularly in cases of rapid immune cell depletion for non-cancer indications, and suggested that pairing it with decentralized manufacturing could make treatments faster and more accessible in regions with limited medical resources.\n\nEvolving patient needs are driving new drug development paradigms. For complex genetic diseases, traditional therapies often fall short. Gene therapies and nucleic acid medicines offer a way to repair defective genes or intervene at the RNA level to control diseases at their source.\n\nModerated by Dr. Julen Oyarzabal, CSO of Syngoi Technologies SL, the session \"Gene Therapy and mRNA Therapeutics\" brought together experts from both academia and industry: Dr. Sergio Linares Fern\u00e1ndez, Unit Head of RNA Science Automation at Sanofi, Dr. Luigi Calzolai, Scientific Officer at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), Dr. Anna Cereseto, Head of Lab for Advanced Genome Editing Technologies at the University of Trento, Co-Founder of Alia Therapeutics, Dr. Robin Shattock, Chair in Mucosal Infection and Immunity at Imperial College London, and Mr. Miroslav Gasparek, CEO and Co-Founder of Sensible Biotechnologies.\n\nExperts agreed that future efforts to improve mRNA therapies should focus on optimizing expression, reducing immunogenicity, extending duration, controlling costs, and improving global accessibility. Mr. Miroslav highlighted that cell-based production of naturally modified RNA can enhance consistency, lower immunogenicity, streamline supply chains, and support large-scale clinical use.\n\nDespite significant therapeutic breakthroughs, CGT still faces substantial obstacles on its path from laboratory concept to broadly accessible clinical product\u2014complex processes, high development difficulty, technical barriers, and stringent regulatory requirements continue to restrict growth and adoption.\n\nModerated by Peter Jones, Director at Pengwin Consultancy, the roundtable \"From Lab to Patient: Overcoming CMC Barriers in Cell and Gene Therapy Manufacturing\" featured Dr. Jin Yin, CTO of the CGT Technology Center at ProBio, Dr. John Maher, Scientific Founder and CSO at Leucid Bio, Dr. Marten Hansen, Head of the Laboratory for Cell Therapy at the Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation, CEO of the Amsterdam Cell Therapy Center, and Dr. Dima Al-hadithi, Partner-CMC, RareGenix/Minaret Consulting Limited.\n\nCell and gene therapies face major challenges, including high costs, complex processes, and scattered batch records. To address these issues, Dr. John Maher and Dr. Marten Hansen highlighted that process optimization and digitalization\u2014including workflow streamlining, platform standardization, and improved batch record management\u2014can reduce costs and enhance quality across R&D, manufacturing, and clinical operations.\n\nOther panelists also agreed that the key to CGT CMC breakthroughs is early planning: defining target selection, quality-by-design, comparability, and supply chain strategies upfront can prevent costly, hard-to-change bottlenecks later.\n\nAmid a global downturn in capital markets, understanding how to identify opportunities in CGT, optimize resource allocation, and achieve meaningful returns remains a top priority.\n\nModerated by Michael Brinkman, Managing Director and Co-Head of U.S. Biopharma Investment Banking at Jefferies, the session \"Innovation and Investment for CGT\" gathered: Dr. Laura Stoppel, Partner on the Investment Team at RA Capital Management, Dr. Hongbo Lu, Founder and Managing Partner of NextBio Capital, Dr. Daniela Couto, General Partner at BioGeneration Ventures, Dr. Michiel Broker, Managing Director and Global Head of Pharma at UBS, and Mr. Matthieu Coutet, Partner of Sofinnova Biovelocita Strategy.\n\nDespite macroeconomic uncertainties, panelists agreed that the scientific breakthroughs and clinical value of CGT continue to provide a strong foundation for long-term investment. Forward-looking strategies\u2014focusing on high-value targets, platforms with strong clinical and manufacturing capabilities, and AI-driven optimization\u2014will enhance capital efficiency and maximize returns.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWith insights shared by global experts and leaders, the GenScript Biotech Global Forum London 2025 concluded successfully.

New York Federal Reserve President John Williams stated he sees \u201croom for a further adjustment\u201d in the near term, sparking a significant market rally. Following his remarks, the probability of the central bank cutting rates at its December meeting jumped from 39% to over 73%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. This positive sentiment provided relief to markets amid concerns over high valuations, particularly in AI-related stocks.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $122.01, up 2.6% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy City Holding? Access our full analysis report here.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nCity Holding\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 1 move greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 2.8% on the news that the earnings season got off to a strong start as several big banks reported third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations.\n\nThe positive results were driven by a rebound in investment banking and strong trading desk performance. JPMorgan Chase reported a significant jump in profit and revenue, boosted by increased trading and dealmaking. Similarly, Wells Fargo saw its shares climb after reporting strong net interest income and raising its guidance. Citigroup also exceeded revenue estimates across all its business lines. While Goldman Sachs also beat expectations, its shares dipped slightly on news of potential job cuts aimed at curbing costs. Overall, the strong reports from these financial giants suggest a healthy pickup in corporate activity and trading.\n\nAlso, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave investors a major reason for optimism by suggesting the Fed could soon stop its quantitative tightening (QT) program. For months, this policy acted like a brake on the economy, systematically draining cash from the financial system to cool inflation. Powell's comments signal that the Fed may be ready to ease its pressure, which would leave more liquidity in the market to flow into assets like stocks.\n\nCity Holding is up 4% since the beginning of the year, and at $122.01 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $133.96 from November 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of City Holding\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,792.\n\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can\u2019t build without.

The company\u2019s returns over the past year were driven by continued operational strength amid cost concerns and a weak asset quality. Business expansion efforts, loan demand and changes in interest rates will aid net interest income (NII) growth. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst projects\u2019 NII to witness a CAGR of 3.3% by 2027. In investment banking (IB), the company\u2019s solid pipeline and market leadership remain competitive strengths, though capital markets volatility and elevated mortgage rates are likely to weigh on fee income. \r\n\r\nOur estimates for non-interest income don\u2019t show a favorable trend this year. Technology and marketing investments will keep costs elevated. The Zacks analyst expect expenses to reflect a CAGR of 4.4% by 2027. A tough macro backdrop raises concerns about asset quality. We expect provisions to rise 10.5% in 2025.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\r\n\r\nNetflix\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the year-to-date period (+18.9% vs. -59.6%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention. \r\n\r\nNFLX's advertising tier now accounts for more than 55% of new sign-ups in available markets. NFLX has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, supported by a diversified content strategy, including international programming, live events, and gaming initiatives. \r\n\r\nNFLX raised its full-year free cash flow forecast to $9 billion from $8-8.5 billion. For the fourth-quarter, Netflix projects $11.96 billion in revenue with 16.7% growth and a 23.9% operating margin, featuring major releases including Stranger Things' final season and NFL Christmas games.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of AbbVie have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+34.9% vs. +17.9%). The company beats third-quarter estimates for both earnings and sales. AbbVie has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity (LOE) by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications. These should support top-line growth in the next few years. \r\n\r\nAbbVie is returning to robust revenue growth in 2025, which is just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE. It has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years to bolster its early-stage pipeline that should drive long-term growth. \r\n\r\nHowever, the company faces several headwinds like Humira LOE impact, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and continued macro headwinds for Aesthetics.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\r\n\r\nOhio Valley Banc\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry over the year-to-date period (+62.5% vs. -1.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $166.30 million is expanding its NIM by reallocating toward higher-yielding commercial and real estate loans and relying on stable, low-cost subsidized deposits that support spread performance. \r\n\r\nTargeted, higher-quality loan growth combined with steady fee income continues to reinforce earnings, while efficiency gains from recent cost-management actions and disciplined capital returns help strengthen overall profitability. Credit metrics remain generally stable. Yet, rising provisioning needs, increased collateral-dependent balances, and reliance on subsidized public deposits introduce added macro sensitivity. \r\n\r\nLoan growth momentum and buyback execution continue to trail peers, tempering near-term confidence. The valuation suggests investors are paying a discounted price for a bank with improving profitability, but balance-sheet and growth risks warrant caution.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Ohio Valley Banc here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Equinix, Inc.

Nowadays, technological advances and changing consumer behavior have led to customers shopping and banking online, making physical locations less\u00a0important.\n\n\"We are not surprised to see locations continue to close as banks look to further leverage their digital footprints, especially mobile banking, to drive costs lower,\" said Wall Street veteran and TheStreet Pro portfolio manager Chris Versace in an email. \"Our question is, how will this real estate be repurposed and what companies are willing to take this on, given commercial vacancy rates?\"\n\nFDIC-insured commercial bank branches by year:\n\n2024: 68,330 2020: 72,756 2015: 80,537 2010: 81,464 2005: 72,321\r\n Source: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n\nThe shift toward digital banking has prompted many banks, including regional powerhouse PNC Bank (PNC), to reassess their footprint, close branch locations, and reimagine their remaining stores to include fewer tellers, more automation, more workspaces, and larger, more comfortable waiting areas.PNC is closing a half dozen branches as it reimagines banking.Photo by Bloomberg on Getty Images\n\nBanking undergoes sea change\n\nThe internet hasn\u2019t just reshaped retail. It has also enabled a major shift in how banks like PNC Bank conduct business with their customers.\n\nBank customers rarely visit physical branches to deposit checks, transfer funds, or withdraw money. Instead, they do those transactions online or via mobile banking apps. The same is true for applying for loans and paying mortgages; many of these transactions are now conducted solely online, often with digital-only lenders like SoFi.\n\nRelated: 70-year-old bank chain closing 51 locations across 13 states\n\nThe shift has led many banks to merge, fail, or shrink the number of branches they operate. Between 2000 and 2020, the number of U.S.\u00a0commercial banks declined by almost 50% as smaller, local institutions struggled to provide services similar to deep-pocketed and technology-enabled rivals such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo.\n\nRegional players like PNC Bank, which have survived, have consolidated their market share within key regions, boosting name recognition, doubling down on community, and expanding into new markets.\n\nThe branches still operated by banks look very different than when I would visit my dad at his branch in the 1980s.\n\nPNC Bank at-a-glance:\n\nFounded: 1845 as the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company\r\n Source: PNC Bank Total assets: $568.8 billion\r\n Source: PNC Bank's Balance Sheet Q3 2025 # of branches:  ~2,200\r\n Source: PNC Bank's Corporate Profile, retrieved Nov. 21, 2025 Employeees: 54,938\r\n Source: PNC Bank's SEC Filing\n\nStory continues\n\nGone are the long\u00a0teller lines and waits to cash or deposit checks on payday. Teller stations have been replaced by small pods staffed by a few employees and comfortable seating and working areas for customers waiting to meet with bankers or investment counselors.\n\nSelf-service kiosks and other technology, akin to self-checkout at the grocery store, have also become common within branches, providing customers with online banking access rather than face-to-face interactions.\n\nOverall, the digital shift has meant that bank branches require far less square footage than in the past, resulting in a move to smaller locations or branch closures.\n\nEconomy creates bank headwinds\n\nBanks like PNC are very sensitive to interest rate changes. When the Federal Reserve increases its Fed Funds Rate, it increases the cost of banks borrowing from each other overnight.\n\nHigher interest rates can boost net income margins because loan rates typically grow faster than rates paid on deposits used to fund them, but they also reduce loan demand. It can also have a big impact on valuing bonds held on bank balance sheets, causing liquidity problems.\n\nRelated: Bank of America raises alarm on worker pay\n\nFor example, when the Fed embraced hawkish monetary policy to wrestle inflation lower in 2022, it forced banks to mark-to-market their bond portfolios at substantially lower valuations. That led to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) on March 10, 2023, during the largest one-day bank run in U.S. history. Customers withdrew a jaw-dropping $42 billion that day.\n\nSignature Bank failed because of similar concerns two days later. First Republic Bank failed on May 1, 2023, resulting in a last-minute acquisition by JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBank balance sheets have been adjusted since then, but the industry now faces different challenges. High housing prices and mortgage lending rates have depressed mortgage demand, as well as demand for home equity loans and HELOCs.\n\nThere is also a growing risk to banks from rising layoffs, unemployment, and inflation, which are crimping many borrowers' budgets and could lead to increased delinquency and defaults on auto loans and credit cards.\n\nPNC Bank closing six branches\n\nBig regional banks aren't unaffected by all the shifting sands impacting the industry, so players, including PNC Bank, are also reevaluating brick-and-mortar branches.\n\nPNC Bank is the nation\u2019s eighth biggest bank, with assets of about $564 billion. It operates about 2,200 branches in 27 states, with a large presence in the Northeast and Midwest, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, and Virginia.\n\nRelated: Beloved retailer makes comeback after closing 100s of stores\n\nLike many banks, PNC Bank has been acquiring smaller banks to bolster its market share in key markets and expand into adjacent markets. Despite those acquisitions, its branch footprint has declined as it closes overlapping locations and, more broadly, consolidates branches.\n\nFor instance, the branch operated 2,589 branches in 2008 when it was much smaller, with just $291 billion in assets.\n\nIn 2023, it closed 223 locations, and it closed about another 20 in 2024. In 2025, its plans include a similar number of closures as last year, including six locations disclosed in documents filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in November.\n\nPNC branches that closed or will soon be closed:\n\n7421 LANCASTER PIKE, HOCKESSIN, DE (closed) 3110 GRACEFIELD RD., SILVER SPRING, MD (closed) 5851 HAMILTON AVE., CINCINNATI, OH (planned) 6055 W.

Overall, PNC Bank continues to grow, and while some locations are closing, it's opening some others, including three new branches:\n\n4600 STATE HWY. 21, STE 100, LEWISVILLE, TX 3300 FORT MEADE RD., LAUREL, MD 2400 W 60TH ST., HIALEAH, FL\r\n Source: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Nov. 15 update\n\nOverall, PNC Bank's management expects to open 200 branches by 2029 as part of its revamped footprint.\n\n\"By the end of the year, we will have opened more than 25 new branches. And importantly, we remain on track to complete our 200-plus branch builds by the end of 2029,\" said CEO William Demchak on PNC Bank's recent earnings call.\n\nOn November 7, PNC Bank increased its estimate for new branch builds by 50% to 300 locations at a cost of $2 billion.\n\n\u201cSometimes it feels like the world is getting less personal,\u201d said Jeff Martinez, PNC\u2019s head of Branch Banking, in October. \u201cThis can be a real differentiator for us by providing that oasis for human connection.\u201d\n\nPNC Bank is also in the midst of integrating its latest acquisition. On Sept. 8, it announced it's acquiring Colorado-based FirstBank in a deal valued at $4.1 billion. The deal nets PNC Bank $26.8 billion in assets and 95 branches in Colorado and Arizona, helping it continue its growth beyond states where it's traditionally operated.\n\n\"This deal will propel PNC to the #1 market share position in retail deposits in branches in Denver. It will also more than triple our branch footprint in Colorado while adding additional presence in Arizona,\" said Demchak.\n\nOn Oct. 15, PNC Bank reported its third-quarter financial results. Revenue totaled $5.92 billion and net income was $1.82 billion, resulting in earnings per share, or EPS, of $4.35, up from $3.85 last year.\n\nRelated: Goldman Sachs President drops blunt take on stocks\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Nov 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Latest Business & Market News section.

DIVO uses covered calls conservatively and has outperformed JEPI by 28% since May 2020. VIG holds 341 stocks with Broadcom as the top holding at 7.18% and yields 1.65%. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIf you want to buy and hold dividend ETFs that won't disappoint you over the long run, it's a good idea to look at iShares Select Dividend ETF (NASDAQ:DVY), Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO), and Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG). They have the characteristics to get through the harshest of recessions and recover. The current environment gives you the perfect opportunity to rotate into them before things potentially get worse.\n\nMany dividend investors are exposed to tech more than they realize, thanks to options ETFs. They promise you double-digit yields with partial exposure to big-name indices. If the market does go through a correction in the near term, it will be a tall order for these ETFs to recover their losses, as they are often fully exposed to downside risk.\n\nBuying alternative ETFs like the following three can add much-needed ballast.\n\niShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY)\n\nThe iShares Select Dividend ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index. This gives it exposure to U.S. stocks with relatively high dividend yields and a history of increasing dividend payments. It is passive and holds 100 stocks.\n\nIt has the most exposure to the utilities sector at 26.82%, with the biggest holding having a weight of just 2.64%. DVY has gained 5.62% year-to-date without counting the dividends and has lagged the broader market in recent years due to the tech rally. That said, if the rotation out of tech stocks continues, DVY can appreciate a lot more.\n\nThe utilities exposure can be a strength in the coming years. Utilities are more insulated from tariff risks and recessions, while also benefiting from increasing electricity demand and oil & gas exports.\n\nDVY comes with a yield of 3.5% and an expense ratio of 0.38%, or $38 per $10,000 invested.\n\nAmplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (DIVO)\n\nWhile many ETFs fully lean into options for double-digit yields, this one does something different. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF is actively managed and holds 20 to 25 stocks at any given time. The objective is to use a portion of these holdings to sell covered call options.\n\nStory Continues\n\nUnlike most other covered call ETFs, DIVO relies on options conservatively. It derives a smaller yield from these options, but it does not face the same pitfalls.\n\nFor example, an ETF like the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) has done worse than DIVO despite having a higher yield. This is because the upside is too constricted by the aggressive options strategy. Each time the market pulls back, it is an uphill battle for JEPI to break even.\n\nDividends reinvested, DIVO has returned 108.6% compared to JEPI's 80.46% since JEPI's inception on May 5, 2020.\n\nDIVO has a dividend yield of 4.6%, with a monthly payout frequency. The expense ratio is just 0.56%, or $56 per $10,000.\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (VIG)\n\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF is great to have if you are looking to hold for the next 5 years. Even if the market rotates into defensive stocks in the near term, the long-term tech rally can still continue due to AI breakthroughs by then.\n\nVIG tracks the performance of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, which leans a lot into tech companies that are growing their dividends aggressively. The underlying index starts with stocks from the S&P U.S. Broad Market Index, excluding REITs, bankrupt firms, and illiquid stocks, then selects those with a 10-year history of rising dividends. It eliminates the top 25% highest-yielding eligible stocks (or top 15% for existing holdings) to avoid financially unstable companies likely to cut dividends.\n\nVIG has gained 9.8% year-to-date, with the top holding being Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) at 7.18%. The second biggest is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 4.79%, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 4.2%, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) at 4.01%, and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) at 3.19%. There are 341 holdings, so it's well-diversified despite the tech exposure in the top 5.\n\nVIG has a yield of 1.65% and an expense ratio of 0.05%, or $5 per $10,000. If you want a lower-risk way to get tech exposure while being paid slight dividends, VIG is worth looking into.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

BCC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Citigroup Inc. C, Bank of America BAC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nAdvanced Energy Industries is a leader in precision power conversion and beyond for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, data centers, and other critical growth areas of technology and the economy.\n\nThe tech firm\u2019s growth outlook improved again after another big beat-and-raise quarter in early November, spurred by \u201cincreased demand for our AI data center solutions.\u201d\n\nAdvanced Energy Industries grew its Data Center Computing segment revenue by 113% in Q3. Its recent AI data center infrastructure ramp-up makes AEIS a strong picks-and-shovels AI stock for investors to consider buying now and in 2026.\n\nAEIS\u2019s recent upward earnings revisions confirmed its bullish AI-boosted outlook and help Advanced Energy Industries earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe stock has doubled the Tech sector (+1,500) over the last 15 years, including a Tech and Nvidia crushing 60% charge in 2025.\n\nThe recent AI-driven pullback offers investors a great opportunity to purchase Advanced Energy Industries stock nearly 20% below its highs.\n\nDespite the drop on Thursday, Nvidia confirmed that the AI arms race remains full steam ahead. The selling marks a healthy recalibration to shake the froth off the top of an overheated market.\n\nAEIS is attempting to hold its ground at a key moving average, with any larger pullback likely marking an even better entry point for long-term investors. Simply put, if investors were happy about buying AI stocks like AEIS several weeks ago, they should be even more excited now.\n\nBuy Top-Ranked AEIS Stock and Hold for AI Upside\n\nAdvanced Energy Industries designs and makes precision power conversion, measurement, and control solutions. The firm\u2019s various products and solutions serve customers across critical industries such as semiconductor equipment, energy, manufacturing, networking and telecommunications, and, more importantly, AI data centers.\n\nAEIS\u2019s largest market has traditionally been semiconductor manufacturing. Its power conversion systems enable some of the key processes needed to build advanced chips, including the current king of tech, AI GPUs like the ones Nvidia makes.\n\nAEIS has recently experienced explosive growth in data center computing, helping supply the efficient, high-power-density power conversion tech used in massive AI server racks from AI hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDemand for AEIS's newest ultra-efficient converters has surged amid the AI arms race. Its Data Center Computing revenue soared roughly 108% in the first three quarters of 2025.\n\nAdvanced Energy Industries has transformed into an AI infrastructure company and a classic picks and shovels investment to capture the AI data center boom, no matter who the forward-facing winners are.\n\nThe company is also well diversified, with an established track record of growth long before AI. On top of that, it pays a dividend, which is supported by its sturdy balance sheet.\n\nThe AI Infrastructure Company\u2019s Growth Outlook\n\nAdvanced Energy Industries grew its Q3 revenue by 23% and its adjusted earnings by 78%. Its top and bottom lines were boosted by its data center segment, which skyrocketed 113% YoY and 21% sequentially.\n\nThe company topped our Q3 EPS estimate by 18% marking its fourth-straight 18% beat. \u201cThird quarter results surpassed the high end of our guidance due to increased demand for our AI data center solutions,\u201d CEO Steve Kelley said in a statement.\n\nThe company boosted its guidance on the back of its bullish AI runway. AEIS saw its Q4 consensus earnings estimate jump 16% since its November 4 release, with its 2026 estimate 14% higher.\n\nThe AI data center stock\u2019s upbeat EPS outlook, which includes its Most Accurate estimates coming in well above consensus, helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.\n\nBuy this AI Data Center Stock On the Dip, Or Wait?\n\nAEIS stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past 15 years to double the Tech sector. This run includes a Tech and Nvidia crushing 60% charge in 2025 that saw it break out meaningfully above its previous trading range that it was stuck in between early 2021 until the summer of 2025.\n\nThe AI data center stock fell to its 50-day moving average on Thursday following the broader market selloff.\n\nThe downturn came despite Nvidia\u2019s latest blockbuster quarter that confirmed the AI race remains in high gear. The selling is healthy and shows that the bulls are ready to finally take some profits after a huge run off the April lows.\n\nAdvanced Energy Industries' stock has no doubt cooled down in terms of RSI levels. Still, it might face more selling pressure if the broader selloff ramps up.\n\nOf course, market timing is exceedingly difficult, meaning investors might want to dip their toes in now in case a near-term bottom is already in. If not, long-term investors can buy more AEIS shares at even lower prices down the road.\n\nIf its earnings growth holds up, AEIS stock looks cheap compared to Tech. It trades at a 30% discount to the Zacks Tech sector and 80% below its recent highs with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.99 (vs. Tech\u2019s 1.4 and its 5.6 highs).\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nBoise Cascade Co. is an engineered wood products and plywood giant. BCC stock has tumbled 50% in the past 12 months as Wall Street dumps the stock based on a variety of industry-specific headwinds and macroeconomic challenges.\n\nThe engineered wood products maker provided disappointing guidance once again when it reported its third quarter 2025 results on November 3.\n\nBoise Cascade\u2019s negative earnings per share (EPS) revisions following its release earn the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and prolong its string of downward EPS revisions.\n\nShould Investors Stay Away from BCC Stock for Now?\n\nBoise Cascade is a leading producer of engineered wood products and plywood. The company is also a huge player in the wholesale distribution of building products in the U.S.\n\nBCC posted an impressive stretch of top-line expansion between 2012 and 2022, highlighted by 18% growth in 2020 and 45% in 2021, driven by the wild Covid-driven housing and home improvement boom.\n\nBoise Cascade followed that up with another 6% sales growth in 2022 before tumbling against a tough to compete against stretch and broader headwinds that are challenging the entire housing-related market.\n\nMortgage rates soared off their lows, while housing prices and inflation have skyrocketed as well, drying up the housing market, crushing demand. On top of that, commodity prices are hurting Boise Cascade. The massive Covid-era pull forward is also hard to overstate and overcome in the short run since it disrupted so much.\n\nThe company\u2019s sales fell 19% in 2023 and 2% in 2024, while its earnings tanked roughly 40% and 20%, respectively. Most recently, Boise Cascade adjusted EPS plummeted 75% YoY in Q3 FY25 on 3% lower sales, as it faces \u201csubdued demand and commodity pricing headwinds.\u201d\n\nBCC\u2019s Q4 earnings estimate tanked 51% since its early November release, with its fiscal 2025 estimate 18% lower and its FY26 consensus down 18%. This backdrop lands Boise Cascade its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), extending its nearly two-year run of plummeting earnings estimates.\n\nThe company did announce on November 18 that it reached an agreement to purchase \u201cHumphrey Company, Inc., a leading two-step distributor of building materials located in Chicopee, Massachusetts, with approximately $145 million in revenue over the last 12 months.\u201d The move helps BCC expand its reach and grow in the key northeast region.\n\nThe stock could also possibly benefit from a potential rotation out of tech. Investors high on Boise Cascade long-term might consider adding BCC to their watchlists instead of buying it right now amid all the headwinds and unknowns surrounding the housing market.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nCitigroup's Card Metrics Improve Year Over Year: What It Means for Asset Quality\n\nCitigroup Inc.\u2019s subsidiary, Citibank N.A., reported mixed credit card performance for October 2025 in its latest SEC filing. For the period ending October 2025, the Citibank Credit Card Master Trust delinquency rate increased to 1.42% from 1.38% in September 2025. However, the figure decreased from 1.52% recorded in October 2024. It also declined from the 1.58% level posted in October 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the Credit Card Issuance Trustnet charge-off rate declined to 1.95% in October 2025 from 2.50% in the prior month. The figure also dropped from 2.36% in October 2024 and 2.61% in October 2019.\n\nCitibank\u2019s lending activity showed a slight slowdown. Principal receivables stood at $20.2 billion compared with $20.3 billion at the beginning of September 2025. On a year-over-year basis, receivables declined 6.9%.\n\nWhile the improvement in net charge-offs and delinquencies on a year-over-year basis is encouraging and suggests near-term stability in repayment behavior, the continued slide in receivables highlights underlying consumer strain amid persistently high borrowing costs. Further, the company\u2019s net credit losses (NCL) witnessed a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.3% over the past four years ended in 2024. In the first nine months of 2025, NCL rose 2.2% year over year. Also, the bank\u2019s provisions for credit losses expanded at a CAGR of 38.9% from 2022 to 2024, and the rising trend continued in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nLooking ahead, Citigroup\u2019s profitability may face headwinds from the continued rise in credit losses in its Branded Cards portfolio. Management expects Branded Cards' NCL between 3.50% and 4% in 2025. Retail Services NCL is projected to be between 5.75% and 6.25%. In 2024, Branded Cards and Retail Services reported net credit losses of 3.64% and 6.27%, respectively.\n\nShould economic conditions weaken further, losses may accelerate, prompting higher loan-loss provisions and pressuring earnings. Also, with interest rates expected to stay elevated for longer, borrowers\u2019 repayment capacity will remain under strain. These dynamics suggest that Citigroup\u2019s asset quality is likely to remain under pressure in the near term.\n\nHow Citigroup Compares with Peers in Credit Card Performance\n\nBank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co. also reported the October 2025 card delinquency rate and charge-off.\n\nBank of America\u2019s BA Master Credit Card Trust II reported a delinquency rate of 1.38% in October, down from 1.52% a year earlier. Bank of America\u2019s net charge-off rate fell to 2.11% from 2.41% in October 2024.\n\nJPMorgan Issuance Trust's delinquency rate edged up to 0.88% in October from 0.87% in the prior year, indicating a slight increase in past-due accounts. Further, JPMorgan\u2019s net charge-off rate declined to 1.44% from 1.62% in October 2024.\n\nC\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\n\nShares of Citigroup have gained 36% over the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 18.8%.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, C trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.35X, below the industry\u2019s average of 14.06X.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for C\u2019s 2025 and 2026 earnings implies year-over-year rallies of 27.4% and 31.2%, respectively. The estimates for 2025 and 2026 have been revised upward over the past 30 days.\n\nEstimates Revision Trend\n\nCurrently, C carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

After watching the Hang Seng power above 26,000 to four-year highs, Timothy Fung, JPMorgan's head of Asia equity strategy in Hong Kong, said the bank feels increasingly comfortable rotating as China's rally rides excitement around DeepSeek and warmer US-China sentiment. India, meanwhile, has been the regional laggard in 2025 by the widest margin in decades, even though the NSE Nifty 50 briefly hit a record on Thursday before slipping 0.4% on Friday while still outperforming a tech-shaken Asia.\n\nIs JPM fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nFung framed the call as a valuation-driven opportunity wrapped inside a fundamentally strong economy. With GDP projected at 6%7% and earnings expected to expand in double digits, he argued that India's premium is not unusual, especially with the Nifty trading near 21 times forward earnings versus the Hang Seng's 12.5. He said the rotation case strengthens as the US and India move closer to finalizing a deal to cut 50% duties after months of talks, with India's trade minister signaling an agreement could be near. Fung also noted they would reconsider shifting back if the Hang Seng slides toward 24,000; the index closed at 25,835.57 on Thursday.\n\nInvestors have already started to probe the opening: the Nifty is up almost 2% this month while MSCI's regional gauge is down around 4%. Fung said India's momentum is increasingly powered by local demand as production relocates from China, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's win in Bihar could help reforms regain pace. In his view, tariffs have weighed on India long enough to create what he sees as a possible re-entry window, especially since global portfolios remain underweight due to deeper familiarity with China's market. For now, he suggested the window could still be open as the valuation gap and policy backdrop begin shifting in India's favor.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-ditches-china-india-heres-130342702.html", "symbols": ["CMC.BE", "CMC.DU", "CMC.F", "CMC.MU", "CMCI.F", "JPM-PC.US", "JPM-PD.US", "JPM.MX", "JPM.US", "JPMC34.SA"], "tags": ["ASIA", "EQUITIES", "INDIA", "TRADE", "VALUATION"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.991, "neg": 0.02, "neu": 0.843, "pos": 0.137}}, {"date": "2025-11-21T12:47:00+00:00", "title": "JP Morgan is pouring $1.5T into 4 industries that are \u2018critical\u2019 for the U.S. economy.

Here\u2019s how it could also work for you\n\n\u201cIt has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing \u2014 all of which are essential for our national security,\u201d Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorganChase, said in a statement (1).\n\n\u201cOur security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America\u2019s economy. America needs more speed and investment.

The hedge fund also added 33,100 shares of Circle, starting a new position.\n\nNeither hedge fund has a large position in Circle. However, the trades are still interesting because several Wall Street analysts believe the stock is deeply undervalued at its current price of $69 per share.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?

Shaw sold\n\nPalantir develops analytics software that lets commercial and government clients integrate data into an ontology, a real-time digital twin that supports decision-making. The company also provides an adjacent artificial intelligence (AI) platform that serves as a large language model orchestration tool, which lets developers to integrate generative AI into business processes and applications.\n\nPalantir delivered another exceptional financial performance in the third quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 63% to $1.1 billion, the ninth straight acceleration. And non-GAAP net income jumped 110% to $0.21 per diluted share. Management also raised full-year guidance, forecasting a 53% increase in revenue for 2025.\n\nYet Israel Englander and David Shaw are not the only hedge fund managers to turn bearish on Palantir. Michael Burry, who famously bet against the subprime mortgages that led to the 2008 financial crisis, recently disclosed a sizable short position in Palantir: Two-thirds of his $1.4 billion portfolio is allocated to Palantir put options.\n\nPalantir CEO Alex Karp has accused short sellers of attempting to manipulate the market, though he himself has sold more than $2 billion in stock over the past two years. I believe the bearish sentiment can be attributed to valuation. Palantir trades at 102 times sales, the most expensive multiple in the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The next closest company in the index is AppLovin, at 32 times sales.\n\nHere's the big picture: Palantir is a key player in the AI platforms market, which is projected to expand quickly in the coming years. But shares trade at a very expensive valuation that leaves little room for long-term upside. Investors should ignore their fear of missing out and steer clear of this particular AI stock until it trades at a more reasonable price.\n\nCircle Internet Group: The stock Millennium Management and D.E. Shaw bought\n\nCircle is the fintech company that issues EURC and USDC, stablecoins whose values are tied to the European euro and the U.S. dollar, respectively. EURC is the largest euro-denominated stablecoin that is compliant with European regulations, and USDC is the second largest stablecoin overall. Only Tether has a larger market value, which is another way of saying there are more Tether tokens in circulation.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan Chase analysts say Circle has an edge. \"USDC's transparent reserve management and regular audits make it more trustworthy among institutional investors and other regulated entities,\" analysts wrote. \"Its compliance with frameworks like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCa) regulation in Europe sets it apart from competitors, making USDC the preferred stablecoin for financial institutions.\"\n\nThe stablecoin market is currently worth about $310 billion. Collectively, EURC and USDC account for about 25% of that total. Jeff Cantwell at Seaport estimates the market will eventually hit $2 trillion, and Bernstein analysts think the market will reach $4 trillion in the next decade, meaning the value of circulating stablecoins may increase as much as twelvefold in the future.\n\nCircle is well positioned to benefit, especially because of its recent push into payments. The Circle Payments Network leans on blockchain to make transactions faster and cheaper and addresses use cases like supplier payments, retail purchases, and employee payroll. Since its launch in May, Circle has enrolled 29 financial institutions, and it has another 500 interested parties in the customer pipeline.\n\nLooking ahead, Circle expects the volume of circulating USDC to increase by 40% annually for the foreseeable future. In turn, Wall Street estimates revenue will increase at 33% annually through 2027. That consensus forecast makes the current valuation of 6.5 times sales very reasonable.

While this was also driven by an increase in fundamentals, the current valuation does, in my opinion, not accurately reflect the degree of improvement the company has shown.\n\nWhat Happened In The Recent Past\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with BUD:DEUTSCHEBANK. Is BUD:DEUTSCHEBANK fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nA few years ago, Deutsche Bank was known for various scandals and was often seen as a stock to be avoided. Since then, the bank has severely improved its performance. Its ROE has improved from 0.85% at the end of 2020 to 4.37% at the end of last year. Furthermore, ROA, which was flat in 2020, is now at 0.4%. Moreover, revenue has doubled in the same time period, and the current dividend per share is the highest it has been in the last 7 years. All of this definitely shows that Deutsche Bank has significantly improved its operations. However, when taking a closer look, one can see that the uptrend has slightly worn off during the last 2-3 years.\n\nOne of the most striking things about the recent performance of Deutsche Bank is that its ROE has started to fall once again, while the company's weighted average cost of capital, which by now is at more than 15%, far exceeds the current ROE value (Figure 1). This raises the question, despite all the improvements, whether Deutsche Bank will be able to generate shareholder value in the future. Also, this comes despite the ECB cutting rates since March 2024, making this a more fundamental issue for Deutsche Bank. Furthermore, ROA is, as already mentioned, 0.4%. However, the company has already reached the same level by the end of 2023, showing a stagnation in this metric as well.It's Time To Sell Deutsche Bank\n\nMoreover, non-performing assets have risen by 8.4% on a 3-year CAGR basis, giving a hint that harder times might come soon. For example, this metric has been negative from 2014 to the end of 2017 and was still only at 4.9% at the end of 2018, one of the hardest years for banking stocks. Another factor that seems to confirm the previous thesis that Deutsche Bank could run into trouble is provisions for loan losses, which, since the end of 2024, are at the highest level in 10 years.\n\nAt the same time, Deutsche Bank only has an equity ratio of roughly 5% (end of 2024), making the stock fairly risky compared to other big American banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that have ratios between 8% and 9%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nValuation\n\nWhen looking at the valuation of Deutsche Bank, one instantly sees that it is elevated compared to its historic values. Figure 2 shows the company's P/E ratio over time. As can be seen, the current one of 10.16 is around the 2021 level. Compared to the 5-year median, DB trades at a premium of 15% at the moment. The same goes for the P/B ratio, which at 0.77 is higher than it has ever been since the end of 2015 and shows a premium of 123% to the median value, suggesting increased expectations. While DB is still comparably cheap compared to companies like JPM and BAC, one has to consider that both of those companies are generally operating better (higher ROE, ROE, lower leverage).It's Time To Sell Deutsche Bank\n\nMoreover, Deutsche Bank has far more volatile earnings than, e.g, JP Morgan, as can be seen in Figure 3. While those of Deutsche Bank showed a volatility of 263% since 2018, JP Morgan's earnings only deviated by 36% on average, again reiterating the far higher risk Deutsche Bank has. Also, it shows that apart from valuation, Deutsche Bank is more risky (and less efficient in terms of ROE) than all other banks included in this example. With 35% of revenues coming from investment banking, Deutsche Bank is far more reliant on markets going up than its peers, which can be seen as a reason for the high earnings volatility. Furthermore, the only moderate deposit base-stability makes Deutsche Bank's corporate banking business inferior to others, as they have to adjust interest rates more quickly for their customers, lowering their profit margin.It's Time To Sell Deutsche Bank\n\nDuring an economic downturn, this combination could seriously impact Deutsche Bank's earnings and dividend yield, as the investment banking and trading business will see decreasing revenues due to fewer IPOs and negative trading returns. Figure 4 shows Deutsche Bank's trading income in comparison to its market cap, again illustrating the huge dependence on this business. As can be seen, the ratio is more than 4 times as high as that of Banco Santander. Moreover, the less stable customer base causes customers to either leave (resulting in lower revenues) or to demand better conditions than other banks are willing to pay, decreasing the spread Deutsche Bank earns by borrowing short-term and lending out long-term.It's Time To Sell Deutsche Bank\n\nThe Situation From a Macro Perspective\n\nFrom a macro perspective, the US yield curve has started to become normal again. However, at a spread of only 0.54% between 10-year and 2-year treasuries, revenues for corporate banking could still be weak. The same goes for credit spreads at only 1.73% (Baa Corporate vs. treasuries), which, on one hand, is good as it indicates no current credit problems, but on the other hand, shrinks revenues for banks. Concerning the German (here a proxy for European) business, the yield curve shows a higher spread of 0.79%, which gives Deutsche Bank more potential in this space. Concerning the interest rate outlook, the Euro area has just arrived at an inflation rate of 2%, which is the target rate. Nevertheless, the recent rate cuts could allow for future spikes in inflation. Especially since some of the lower inflation might be driven by lower export prices due to both the USD as well as the Yuan losing against the Euro since the start of the year. In the US, inflation also remains elevated, with Powell seemingly not wanting to cut rates in the near future.\n\nAll of this could lead to backlashes, especially since Deutsche Bank seems to try to rebuild its investment banking presence by acquiring Numis UK M&A and equity research and trading operation, which is dependent on a stronger economy that could be driven by rate cuts and more investments. Moreover, the latter one is also endangered as peace talks about Ukraine are on their way, which could lead to a significant decrease in debt-related spending by EU member states, especially Germany.\n\nI am especially sceptical of this strategy as Deutsche Bank has achieved most of its recent progress by concentrating on its core business. The current expansionary move, combined with the weaker ROE and a higher cost of capital, as well as a huge P/B premium, sounds rather like a step back.\n\nGuru Activity\n\nConcerning investment Gurus, there has recently not been a lot of noise about Deutsche Bank, despite the strong rise in the stock. However, Martin Whitman has notably sold almost 30% of his stake in the company, which was and still is his second-largest holding. Moreover, according to a Morningstar analyst report by Niklas Kammer, CFA, puts a fair value estimate of 19.7 or 23.2 USD on the stock, which, in my opinion, is fair given that DB should trade at a premium to its historic P/B due to the improved operations. Nevertheless, the premium should not be as high as it currently is, at over 100%.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, Deutsche Bank has definitely made progress over the last few years. However, given the recent developments in both performance and strategy, it seems like the current streak of improvement has worn off for now. This puts the stock in jeopardy, given the high historical valuation, which is why the company gets a sell rating for now. Shorting the company, however, is, in my opinion, not advisable due to its still intact momentum.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-sell-deutsche-bank-084833100.html", "symbols": ["1DBK.MI", "BAC.US", "DB.US", "DBAG34.SA", "DBK.BE", "DBK.DU", "DBK.F", "DBK.HA", "DBK.HM", "DBK.MU", "DBK.XETRA", "DBN.MX", "JPM.US"], "tags": ["BANKS", "DIVIDENDS", "FINANCIALS", "M-A", "RATES", "SHAREHOLDER"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.86, "pos": 0.09}}, {"date": "2025-11-20T22:48:29+00:00", "title": "Not All Tariffs Costs Have Passed Through: JPM's Feroli", "content": "Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Securities, says a December rate cut will be a \"very close call.\" He tells Romaine Bostick and Katie Greifeld on \"The Close\" that tariff-related price pressures likely haven't fully passed through and core inflation may stay in the upper-2% range longer than the Fed would prefer.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/not-tariffs-costs-passed-jpms-224829571.html", "symbols": ["CMC.BE", "CMC.DU", "CMC.F", "CMC.MU", "CMCI.F", "JPM-PC.US", "JPM-PD.US", "JPM.MX", "JPM.US", "JPMC34.SA"], "tags": ["FED", "INFLATION", "RATES"], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.296, "neg": 0.078, "neu": 0.883, "pos": 0.039}}, {"date": "2025-11-20T22:00:36+00:00", "title": "U.S. banks set aside $20B Argentina bailout plan - report", "content": "[Trump Meets With Foreign Dignitaries On Sidelines Of UNGA]\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images News\n\nU.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM]), Bank of America (BAC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC]), and Citigroup (C [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/C]), have shelved a $20B bailout of Argentina, choosing to focus on a smaller, shorter-term loan package instead to support the fiscally stressed government, according to a media report on Thursday.\n\nLast month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Trump administration, seeking to support Argentine President Javier Milei's pro-reform party, announced a $20B currency swap [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4505800-argentina-us-bailout-currency-swap-banks-collateral-loan] with the U.S. Treasury and plans for a $20B debt facility from U.S. banks.\n\nBanks are now saying the $20B loan package is no longer under serious consideration, the _Wall Street Journal_ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Investment Narrative Recap\n\nTo be a shareholder in JPMorgan Chase, you need confidence in its ability to grow client assets, maintain fee revenue, and deliver consistent earnings despite evolving technology, regulatory, and legal pressures. The recent congressional subpoenas and internal review into Epstein-related accounts bring additional regulatory and reputational risk, but for now, the most important short-term catalyst, expansion in higher-margin wealth management services, remains the focal point. The immediate business and financial impact of the news may not be material, but it puts compliance rigor in the spotlight.\n\nAmong recent company developments, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s opening of four new J.P. Morgan Financial Centers in California stands out for supporting its main catalyst: capturing more affluent clients and enhancing fee-based growth. This expansion of the wealth management network aligns with ongoing efforts to reinforce earnings from premium services, while also signaling the bank\u2019s commitment to innovation and client service even as legal and regulatory risks grow more complex. However, in contrast to that positive momentum, investors should be aware of potential rising compliance and legal costs...\n\nRead the full narrative on JPMorgan Chase (it's free!)\n\nJPMorgan Chase's forecasts see revenue reaching $186.7 billion and earnings at $55.5 billion by 2028. This outlook relies on an annual revenue growth rate of 4.5% and a minimal earnings increase of $0.3 billion from current earnings of $55.2 billion.\n\nUncover how JPMorgan Chase's forecasts yield a $327.70 fair value, a 8% upside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other PerspectivesJPM Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\n\nWhile most analysts expected JPMorgan to reach over US$184.6 billion in revenue and US$53.2 billion in earnings by 2028, some bearish perspectives emphasized risks from rising legal and regulatory costs. If recent investigations make these risks more immediate, it\u2019s a reminder that not all investors agree about the bank\u2019s outlook or resilience.

Subscribe to our free daily WealthManagement newsletters.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s asset management arm is pitching private markets as essential ballast to investor portfolios amid stretched stock valuations and unreliable bond hedges.\n\nWith stock gains increasingly driven by a handful of large caps and bonds potentially offering less protection in downturns, the traditional 60/40 portfolio mix needs reinforcement, the $4 trillion asset manager said in its 2026 investment outlook. Private credit, so-called secondaries \u2014 markets where limited partners can sell their stakes to other institutions \u2014 and opportunistic debt strategies should be treated as essential, not optional, the firm says.\n\n\u201cA key reason for having bonds in a portfolio is that they are supposed to zag when stocks zig. But if stocks zig and bonds zig too, then you lose the diversification benefit from diversification into bonds,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \u201cThis is where alternatives come in.\u201d\n\nPrivate credit is the centerpiece of JPMorgan\u2019s view, with strategists pointing to its \u201chealthy premium\u201d over public debt. But they also highlight the need for range of investments as ways to build resilience if growth slows.\n\nRead more: Private Credit Leans on Secondaries as Investor Payouts Dwindle\n\nWall Street has proposed tweaks to 60/40 for years \u2014 adding commodities, real estate and even crypto to investment strategies. But the recent surge of institutional flows into private markets signals something more permanent. What once lived at the edges of a portfolio is now being folded into its foundation.&nbsp;\n\nThe shift isn\u2019t without controversy. Critics warn that some of the benefits \u2014 from diversification to downside protection \u2014 may not hold when markets come under pressure. Liquidity gaps and opaque pricing remain key concerns as more capital moves in.\n\nStill, JPMorgan\u2019s \u201c60/40+\u201d framing captures a broader turn: The old playbook hasn\u2019t been discarded, but it is being rewritten \u2014 this time around assets that used to sit on the sidelines.\n\nKelly argues that investors can reallocate to alternatives by trimming both stocks and bonds in line with their original 60/40 split \u2014 preserving balance while shifting portfolio structure.\n\n\u201cInvestors can fund a 10% position or a 20% position or a 30% position in alternatives proportionately from the 60% stocks, 40% bonds and just make each of those slices smaller,\u201d Kelly added. \u201cAnd if they do that, we think it gives better diversification, more stability in the portfolio going forward.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more: BlackRock Says 2% Bitcoin Allocation Is \u2018Reasonable Range\u2019\n\nSo far this year, megacap tech stocks have lifted the markets higher with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 posting double-digit gains. Still, concerns over concentrated and highly valued public AI equities \u2014 such as the Magnificent 7 comprising some 35% of the S&P 500 and the index\u2019s forward P/E reaching 23x \u2014 are pushing some investors toward alternative assets with lower market correlation.&nbsp;\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s very excited about AI and, indeed, we are excited about AI, too,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut the question is: Does AI justify the valuations of all of these huge megacap companies, or is it going to be a day of reckoning? Chances are, eventually, something will go wrong and there will be a day of reckoning.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, artificial intelligence remains a central theme as the technology shifts from so-called proofs-of-concept to large-scale adoption. According to the outlook, entitled AI Lift and Economic Drift, investors are now shifting focus on where to allocate capital across the AI value chain, with private markets offering broad opportunities from venture capital to data-center infrastructure. For instance, the outlook cites how massive hyperscaler spending is effectively channeling value from public to private markets, where private equity, infrastructure and private credit funds are driving the build-outs.As for the broader economy, Kelly does not foresee a recession in the year ahead, though he admits that worries about the outlook continue to persist.\n\n\u201cWe think the economy will grow at a moderate pace. Perhaps for most Americans, it\u2019s going to feel like a pretty mediocre, disappointing economy,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut there\u2019s enough of a surge in capital spending coming from the AI boom and in consumer spending from the increase in wealth of richer households that should keep this economy growing, barring some shocks.\u201d\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/private-credit-becomes-core-jpmorgan-210158691.html", "symbols": ["JPM.US"], "tags": ["AI", "ALTERNATIVES", "INVESTMENT-STRATEGY", "PORTFOLIO-DIVERSIFICATION", "PRIVATE-CREDIT", "SPLIT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.039, "neu": 0.82, "pos": 0.141}}, {"date": "2025-11-20T18:30:14+00:00", "title": "Whale Dump Meets Quantum Panic: Bitcoin Slips to $86,000 and Blows $220 Million Longs", "content": "bitcoin whale, Quantum rsiks. Photo by BeInCrypto\n\nBitcoin fell below $87,000 on November 20, 2025, amid a storm of quantum security fears and $1.3 billion whale capitulation. In the process, it blew almost $220 million in long positions out of the water.\n\nThis sharp decline extended a two-day pattern of Asian rebounds erased by US market sell-offs. Traders struggled with mixed signals from institutional buyers and a wave of retail panic.\n\nQuantum Computing Panic Triggers Market-Wide Fear\n\nThe latest sell-off accelerated after billionaire Ray Dalio raised concerns about Bitcoin's vulnerability to advances in quantum computing.\n\nHis remarks reignited debate in the cryptocurrency community, focusing attention on cryptographic security risks.\n\n\"I have a small percentage of Bitcoin I've had forever, like 1% of my portfolio. I think the problem with Bitcoin is that it's not going to be a reserve currency for major countries because it can be tracked, and it could be conceivably controlled, hacked, and so on,\" Ray Dalio stated.\n\nHowever, market analysts pushed back on the quantum panic narrative. Mel Mattison, a financial analyst, argued that these fears are overblown and overlook Bitcoin's strong cryptography in comparison to traditional banks.\n\n\"If people are selling BTC on quantum decryption, they should be selling the hell out of every bank on the planet. JPM should be down 20%. Every account will be hackable. BTC is SHA-256, which is tougher than RSA,\" Mel Mattison countered.\n\nThis debate reflects a significant divide in how investors assess long-term tech risks. While Dalio highlighted theoretical vulnerabilities as quantum computing develops, critics point out that Bitcoin's SHA-256 provides stronger security than the RSA standard used by most banks.\n\nIf quantum computers pose a threat to Bitcoin, global banking may face even greater risks.\n\nEarly Bitcoin Adopter Exits With $1.3 Billion Sale\n\nAdding to quantum security worries, blockchain analytics firm Arkham reported a massive capitulation. Owen Gunden, an early Bitcoin adopter who accumulated holdings since 2011, sold his entire 11,000 BTC for about $1.3 billion.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/arkham/status/1991528115638800804?s=20\n\nGunden\u2019s exit came at a precarious time for sentiment.

The reasons are unclear, whether profit-taking, rebalancing, or concerns about Bitcoin\u2019s outlook.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStill, the sale injected extra supply into an oversold market and deepened the price slide.\n\nMassive Liquidation Cascade Accelerates Decline\n\nQuantum fears and whale selling sparked a large liquidation cascade across exchanges. CoinGlass data shows over $910 million in crypto positions were liquidated in 24 hours, forcing out 222,008 traders.\n\nDuring one hour in early US trading, long liquidations spiked to $264.79 million while shorts hit $256.44 million.Crypto Liquidations in the Last Hour. Source: Coinglass\n\nThese forced closures highlight the significant leverage in crypto markets and how quickly positions can unwind during sharp market moves.\n\nThis cascade revealed structural weaknesses in crypto derivatives as well. As Bitcoin dropped from above $91,000 to $86,000 in 48 hours, leveraged traders faced margin calls and had their positions automatically closed.\n\nThis automated selling created further price declines and additional liquidations, fueling a cycle of volatility.\n\nInstitutional Buyers Return Despite Retail Panic\n\nDespite the sell-off, US Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) saw $75 million in net inflows on Wedneday, ending a five-day outflow streak.\n\nBlackRock's IBIT and Grayscale's mini ETF accounted for all the inflows, showing that some institutional investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity.\n\nYet, sentiment among ETF issuers remained mixed. VanEck, Fidelity, and other large issuers reported flat or negative flows, indicating cautious optimism.Bitcoin ETF Flows on November 19.

Investors now face the question of whether the quantum narrative signals real risk or simply profit-taking after Bitcoin\u2019s rally this year.\n\nThe next days will show whether institutional support can hold prices steady or if more declines lie ahead as the market processes these risks and the influx of long-term holder supply.\n\nRead original story Whale Dump Meets Quantum Panic: Bitcoin Slips to $86,000 and Blows $220 Million Longs by Lockridge Okoth at beincrypto.com\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whale-dump-meets-quantum-panic-183014682.html", "symbols": ["BTC-USD.US", "BTC.CC", "JPM.US"], "tags": ["BITCOIN", "CRYPTO", "ETF-CRYPTO", "INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS", "LIQUIDATION", "QUANTUM-COMPUTING", "SPLIT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.989, "neg": 0.106, "neu": 0.834, "pos": 0.059}}, {"date": "2025-11-20T17:46:59+00:00", "title": "JPMorgan Says This Is Where You Should Be Investing in AI", "content": "PeopleImages.com - Yuri A / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuick Read\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) forecasts tech giant AI capital spending will exceed $500B annually by 2026. JPMorgan expects 30% productivity gains in AI-impacted sectors. Nvidia (NVDA) Blackwell chips are sold out through 2026 and the company trains over 90% of cutting-edge AI models. Vistra (VST) and Iren (IREN) address power bottlenecks as AI is projected to require an additional 662 TWh of U.S. electricity by 2030. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just issued its Outlook 2026 report that frames artificial intelligence (AI) as a multi-decade productivity revolution on par with electricity or the internet, with no evidence of a bubble forming yet.\n\nMassive tailwinds are pushing the technology forward as supply constraints remain severe. For example, data center vacancy rates sit at 1% to 2%, new capacity is 75% to 100% pre-leased years in advance, and leading-edge chips are sold out 12 to 18 months ahead.\n\nCapital spending by the tech giants has tripled since 2023 and is forecast to top $500 billion annually by 2026 -- nearly a quarter of all U.S. corporate capex. Power demand also stands out as the sharpest bottleneck, with AI projected to drive an additional 662 terawatt hours (TWh) of U.S. electricity consumption by 2030, equivalent to adding several new Texases to the grid. Transmission backlogs exceed five years, and 70% of lines are over 25 years old.\n\nWhile knowledge-worker disruption is real, the bank expects net job gains and 30% productivity increases in impacted sectors. JPMorgan's core advice: overweight large-cap AI leaders, target the physical supply chain (chips and power first), embrace adopters across industries, and use private markets for later-stage application plays.\n\nPublic equities offer the clearest exposure today through the infrastructure layers that must scale before broader monetization arrives.\n\nSemiconductors: Still the Tightest Link in the Chain\n\nJPMorgan repeatedly stresses that chip supply, not demand, will gate the entire buildout for years. Advanced nodes are capacity-constrained, hyperscalers are locking in multi-year deals, and foundry expansion lags far behind announced demand.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the undisputed leader -- its platforms train and run over 90% of cutting-edge models, Blackwell chips are booked solid through 2026, and it ranks among the handful of companies driving the capex surge. The report specifically calls out Nvidia\u2019s near-monopoly in accelerated computing and its ability to command premium pricing in a supply-starved market.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) complements this perfectly with custom AI accelerators (Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and ByteDance are major clients) and high-bandwidth networking silicon. JPMorgan points to the explosion in optical and co-packaged optics demand as AI clusters scale to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. Broadcom is the only merchant supplier at scale for many of these critical components, giving it years of secured growth.\n\nPower and Data Centers: The Real Bottleneck\n\nThe report calls energy \u201cthe binding constraint\u201d multiple times, noting multi-year permitting delays, retiring coal plants, and surging loads from AI clusters. Nuclear restarts, natural gas buildout, and grid upgrades will be required at unprecedented scale.\n\nVistra (NYSE:VST) aligns tightly with this thesis: it is the largest competitive power generator in Texas and the Midwest, with a mix of gas, nuclear, and battery storage located exactly where hyperscalers are clustering data centers and signing 10- to 20-year direct power purchase agreements. Vistra has already announced multiple hyperscaler deals and is restarting units to meet AI-specific load -- exactly the type of flexible, merchant exposure JPMorgan says will capture massive pricing power as wholesale rates spike.\n\nIREN (NASDAQ:IREN) represents the entrepreneurial edge of the same thesis. By building data centers on stranded or underutilized renewable and gas sites in Texas, British Columbia, and soon other grids, IREN can offer immediate, low-cost megawatts that hyperscalers desperately need while traditional utilities wait in five-plus-year interconnection queues. Its ability to pivot existing Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) mining load to cloud or high-performance computing (HPC) contracts overnight gives it optionality that pure utilities lack, and its 816 megawatts (MW) of secured power capacity (with more under contract) positions it as one of the fastest-scaling pure-play AI data-center power providers in public markets.\n\nHyperscalers: Safe Scale Exposure Until Infrastructure Catches Up\n\nAlthough value is gradually shifting downstream to applications and private companies, the mega-cap cloud providers remain central for now. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) via AWS are cited for their massive AI-infused cloud growth and capex commitments, with pre-leased facilities and vertical integration giving them durable advantages during the supply crunch.\n\nThese two (along with Google) are absorbing the majority of new chip and power capacity, translating directly into accelerating cloud revenue. Microsoft\u2019s total commercial bookings\u00a0alone are now running at a $100 billion-plus annual run rate.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s clearest message is that the next several years belong to the physical enablers -- semiconductors and especially power -- because these layers must expand before software and services can fully capture value. Nvidia and Broadcom are riding the chip shortage with no relief in sight through at least 2028, while Vistra and IREN sit at the heart of the power bottleneck the bank identifies as the single largest hurdle to AI scaling.\n\nWith hyperscalers committing trillions over the coming decade, chronic undersupply in both chips and electrons, and regulatory timelines measured in half-decades, these infrastructure providers are positioned for multi-year pricing power and earnings growth that most application-layer companies simply cannot access until the physical buildout catches up.\n\nFor investors, these stocks are the most direct and defensible way to ride what JPMorgan sees as a once-in-a-generation supercycle.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

In 2024, Branded Cards and Retail Services reported net credit losses of 3.64% and 6.27%, respectively.\n\nShould economic conditions weaken further, losses may accelerate, prompting higher loan-loss provisions and pressuring earnings. Also, with interest rates expected to stay elevated for longer, borrowers\u2019 repayment capacity will remain under strain. These dynamics suggest that Citigroup\u2019s asset quality is likely to remain under pressure in the near term.\n\nHow Citigroup Compares With Peers in Credit Card Performance\n\nBank of America BAC and JPMorgan Chase & Co.JPM also reported the October 2025 card delinquency rate and charge-off.\n\nBank of America\u2019s BA Master Credit Card Trust II reported a delinquency rate of 1.38% in October, down from 1.52% a year earlier. Bank of America\u2019s net charge-off rate fell to 2.11% from 2.41% in October 2024.\n\nJPMorgan Issuance Trust's delinquency rate edged up to 0.88% in October from 0.87% in the prior year, indicating a slight increase in past-due accounts. Further, JPMorgan\u2019s net charge-off rate declined to 1.44% from 1.62% in October 2024.\n\nC\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\n\nShares of Citigroup have gained 36% over the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 18.8%.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, C trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.35X, below the industry\u2019s average of 14.06X.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings F12M\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for C\u2019s 2025 and 2026 earnings implies year-over-year rallies of 27.4% and 31.2%, respectively.

It manages $295 billion in assets, with a little more than half of that being credit, according to the firm's most recent filings.\n\nThe company has gained a foothold in private lending within a range of categories, from consumer loans via fintech platforms such as SoFi (SOFI) and PayPal (PYPL) to private US companies. This year, it also notched a string of major data center deals with tech giants, including a $27 billion joint venture financing deal with Meta Platforms (META) last month.\n\nNYSE - Nasdaq Real Time Price\u2022USD\n\n(OWL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n14.02\n\n+0.23\n\n+(1.67%)\n\nAs of 11:43:24 AM EST. Market Open.  OWLOBDC\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nIn a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, co-CEO Lipschultz described the AI infrastructure development as \"an opportunity for Blue Owl to do something really special.\"\n\nPacker, along with other fund executives, pitched the merger to shareholders just two weeks ago as an effort to save administration costs for both funds, which hold nearly the same kind of assets.\n\nBut the merger involved exchanging stakes in the private fund for those in the larger one, which, based on current prices, entailed a sharp unrealized loss of roughly 20% for private fund investors who had the authority to vote down the combination.\n\nEarlier this week, Blue Owl's stock slumped 7% following a Financial Times report that first spotted that potential haircut. It recovered some of those gains on Thursday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCredit quality wasn't the problem, according to Piper Sandler analyst Crispin Love. Instead, the problem was the merger's timing coinciding with the market's sagging view of private credit, Crispin added.\n\nLooking ahead, Crispin said he'll be paying close attention to how many investors in the private fund will be looking to exit at their next opportunity in January.\n\nQuarterly withdrawals from the private fund had already doubled in the previous quarter to $60 million compared to the year-ago period, according to regulatory filings. It is not clear why.\n\nThe company is also taking concrete steps to move into retail investor, wealth management, and retirement account channels. Its private fund in the scrapped merger is primarily marketed to financial advisers.\n\nLike other Wall Street giant fund managers, Blue Owl's stock has faced a tough 2025 after soaring over the previous two years.\n\nYear to date, Blue Owl's stock is down 39%, underperforming rivals Ares Management (ARES), Yahoo Finance owner Apollo Global Management (APO), and Blackstone (BX). The firm's stock is also the most shorted among peers, according to Yahoo Finance data.No rush: Blue Owl CEO Craig Packer speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 19. (Reuters/Brendan McDermid)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nWall Street has been worried about credit in recent months following two major bankruptcies \u2014 subprime auto lender Tricolor and auto parts supplier First Brand \u2014 as well as some other idiosyncratic cases where lenders have taken losses and alleged fraud. Blue Owl said it has no exposure to either of the bankruptcies.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's decision to further lower its benchmark policy rate would make it easier for these same giants to buy and sell their fund assets, according to CFRA analyst Ken Leon. That also means delaying such cuts would push out those benefits.\n\nBut co-CEO Lipschultz did get caught in the crossfire after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon cast some doubt over the bank's private lending rivals.\n\n\"We don't know all the underwriting standards that all of these people did,\" Dimon told analysts last month while addressing the bank's own $170 million loss on a loan to Tricolor. His comments weren't specifically targeted at Blue Owl, but co-CEO Lipschultz was prompted to fire back when asked later the same day at an alternative asset summit in Los Angeles. He referred to what Dimon said as \"an odd kind of fear mongering.\u201d\n\nPrivate credit remains \"under a microscope,\" Piper Sandler's Love added in the same Wednesday note.\n\nDavid Hollerith covers the financial sector, ranging from the country's biggest banks to regional lenders, private equity firms, and the cryptocurrency space.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-blue-owl-found-itself-at-the-middle-of-wall-streets-latest-private-credit-fears-164250341.html", "symbols": ["0QN.F", "1FB.MI", "2PP.F", "2PP0.F", "6B0.F", "APO.US", "ARES.US", "CMC.BE", "CMC.DU", "CMC.F", "CMC.MU", "CMCI.F", "FB20.F", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.HM", "FB2A.MU", "JPM-PC.US", "JPM-PD.US", "JPM.MX", "JPM.US"], "tags": ["MARKET-VOLATILITY", "MERGER", "PRIVATE-CREDIT", "PRIVATE-DEBT", "RETAIL-INVESTORS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.112, "neg": 0.053, "neu": 0.895, "pos": 0.052}}, {"date": "2025-11-20T16:16:00+00:00", "title": "Merchant Service Providers Market Report 2025-2029 and 2034", "content": "Dublin, Nov.  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Merchant Service Providers Market Report 2025\" has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nThe merchant service providers market is poised for remarkable growth, with projections estimating an increase from $49.9 billion in 2024 to $56.97 billion in 2025, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.2%. This upward trajectory is fueled by factors such as increased credit and debit card usage, rising internet retail activities, and expanded retail infrastructure, further augmented by a surge in consumer disposable income.\n\nLooking ahead, the market is expected to reach $95.61 billion in 2029, driven by the demand for unified payment platforms, cross-border e-commerce growth, and the expansion of payment options in developing economies. Key trends shaping the landscape include artificial intelligence integration for fraud detection, biometric authentication in payments, and the expansion of buy-now-pay-later models.\n\nThe increasing adoption of digital payments acts as a catalyst for market expansion. These payments, facilitated by mobile wallets, contactless cards, and online banking systems, offer secure and fast transactions, gaining traction due to smartphone proliferation. The Banque de France reported a 7.4% year-on-year increase in non-cash transactions in the Euro area during the first half of 2024, underscoring the rise in digital payments.\n\nProminent companies are investing in advanced solutions like tokenization to enhance transaction security. Recently, PayU introduced its Push Provisioning platform, which enables easy card tokenization while strengthening online payment security. This move simplifies merchant onboarding and builds consumer trust.\n\nIn strategic developments, Global Payments Inc. acquired EVO Payments Inc. for $4 billion in March 2023.

After years of chasing high-growth tech companies in a zero-interest-rate environment, many investors are now seeking more stable, income-generating assets amid economic uncertainty and falling interest rates. The spectacular run-up in tech valuations, particularly in AI-related stocks, has left many investors concerned about stretched valuations and the sustainability of growth narratives, prompting a defensive shift toward companies that can demonstrate profitability and return cash to shareholders. Especially since, according to Bloomberg, the Magnificent 7 are spending less on buybacks and more on capital expenditures.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points\n\nData is increasingly showing that investors are moving from tech giants to dividend-paying blue-chip stocks. Many investors are concerned with the circular financing between the big AI players and the hyperscalers.

But that latter profile has taken a hit in recent weeks, as the likes of Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ: ORCL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN),\u00a0 and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) tap the credit market for billions to fund artificial intelligence projects. The result is the first sustained selloff for the group since April, with the Nasdaq 100 leading the broader market lower as investors ditch tech winners in favor of more defensive stocks. One of the beneficiaries: companies with juicy dividend payments. That group, which includes old-economy stalwarts, is often coveted when riskier stocks start to look expensive. They also tend to be calmer in times of turbulence. The Cboe Volatility Index jumped above 24 on Tuesday (11/18), surpassing its long-term average of 19.\n\nBlue-chip stocks are shares of large, well-established, financially stable companies with a consistent and reliable performance history. They are often considered less risky and are a popular choice for long-term investors. Additionally, nearly all leaders in the category pay dependable, recurring dividends each quarter, regardless of the state of the economy. The term \"blue chip\" originated in poker, where the highest-value chip is blue.

Power: Advised and DIY Investors Seem to Like AI Assistants", "content": "You can find original article here WealthManagement. Subscribe to our free daily WealthManagement newsletters.\n\nInvestors are responding well to AI-powered assistants when using digital wealth platforms, according to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Wealth Management Digital Experience Study released Thursday.&nbsp;\n\nThe average overall satisfaction among advised investors using an app or website with a virtual assistant was 767 points (on a 1,000-point scale)\u2014about 72 points higher than that of investors who don\u2019t have access to an AI-driven assistant. Among do-it-yourself investors, the score was 47 points higher, on average, for wealth platforms that use assistants.&nbsp;\n\nIf investors don\u2019t have access to an AI assistant, these types of results may push other firms to add them soon. According to J.D. Power, more than half of wealth management platforms offer virtual assistants, with 60% of DIY apps and 54% of advised platforms providing them.\n\n\u201cThe AI-driven assistant is not really new to financial services, but is more mature on the banking side than wealth and is really in an early stage of maturity in terms of what it could and will do,\u201d said Mike Foy, managing director and head of wealth intelligence at J.D. Power.\n\nFoy said they will also continue to advance their capabilities.\n\n\u201cMore personalized proactive advice and guidance, greater automation or efficiency of operational processes like onboarding, and natural language transparency are important areas where we expect improvements,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, the study notes that even the most sophisticated virtual assistants are limited to routine tasks and do not proactively anticipate investor needs. More complex queries still require human intervention from advisors or agents.\n\nAs firms continue to enhance their digital capabilities, J.D. Power cautioned that they must be able to quickly connect clients to human advisors or representatives across desktop, mobile apps, and phone calls.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft released a report on the jobs most likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence, and personal financial advisors landed at No. 30 out of 40. Reporting by WealthManagement.com among advisors, however, found resounding pushback on the finding, with advisors saying they don\u2019t feel threatened by what they see as a relationship business.&nbsp;\n\nBoth advised and DIY wealth management platforms have continued to invest resources in their digital offerings, with a focus on sleek interfaces, portfolio analytics and AI-driven assistants.&nbsp;\n\n\u201cThe continued growth of fintech players in the wealth management space has really raised the bar on investor expectations of a truly personalized digital experience,\u201d Foy said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nJ.D. Power, which ranks satisfaction scores among wealth management platform providers, noted that its 2025 digital experience study was redesigned from prior years and so was not comparable to 2024.&nbsp;\n\nWith that context, among advised portal providers, Wells Fargo jumped three spots ahead of the firm\u2019s similar report last year to get the highest customer satisfaction score with 756 out of 1,000.&nbsp;\n\nIt was followed by 2024\u2019s top-ranked firm, J.P. Morgan Wealth Management (748), and then Vanguard (744), which jumped two spots from its ranking in the similar report in 2024. Charles Schwab (740), U.S. Bank (739), and Citi (736) rounded out the firms above the segment average of 734. The bottom rungs were occupied by Ameriprise (712), Raymond James (708), and LPL (627).\n\nIn the DIY investment sector, Robinhood took the top spot with a score of 724. That was two places higher than J.D. Power\u2019s similar report from 2024.&nbsp;\n\nRobinhood was followed by Charles Schwab (717), Fidelity (713), Stash (713)\u2014which dropped two spots from 2024, and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management (709). The lowest-scoring firms J.D. Power showed were Vanguard (696), E*Trade from Morgan Stanley (689), and Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Edge (674).&nbsp;\n\nThe study was based on responses from 5,608 advised and DIY investors fielded from June through August 2025.Advised_Satisfaction_JDPower.pngDIY_Satisfaction_JDPower.png\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-d-power-advised-diy-130000365.html", "symbols": ["CITI.US", "HOOD.US", "JPM.US", "LPLA.US", "RJF.US", "SCHW.US", "STASH.US", "USB.US", "WFC.US"], "tags": ["AI-ASSISTANTS", "CUSTOMER-SATISFACTION", "DIGITAL-EXPERIENCE", "FINTECH", "WEALTH-MANAGEMENT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.013, "neu": 0.84, "pos": 0.147}}]
