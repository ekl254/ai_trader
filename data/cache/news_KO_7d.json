[{"date": "2025-11-23T11:30:07+00:00", "title": "Black Friday battles: Why Walmart is still thumping Target", "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI really have no good explanations this week for why Walmart (WMT) continues to kick Target's (TGT) teeth in, operationally speaking.\n\nWall Street people I've spoken with about this quarter just crunched some numbers for their models and noted that Walmart is taking market share. Borderline useless to me.\n\nMy nearly 65,000 followers on X and LinkedIn gave me better insight \u2014 with a side of sass. I appreciated it.\n\nBut when push came to shove, the most eloquent answer came from Walmart CFO John David Rainey to me on Yahoo Finance (video above).\n\nI asked him point-blank why Walmart is shredding Target. While he didn't mention Target by name \u2014 a no-no within old companies like Walmart and Coca-Cola (KO) \u2014 what he said made a lot of sense.\n\n\"I think there's historically this notion that maybe there's a trade-off between value and convenience,\" Rainey said. \"And I think at Walmart, that's a bit of a false choice. We can provide both of those, and we're demonstrating that. And that's one of the reasons that we're gaining so much [market] share.\"\n\nRainey noted that consumers have been seeking value for the past couple of quarters. \"It stands to reason if times are getting more difficult or budgets are being strained more, you're only going to become more choiceful, more value seeking,\" Rainey said. \"And so, customers we see are looking to do business with companies that provide that value, that give them the convenience that they've come to know and expect. That's why we are consistently executing well.\"\n\nTherein lies the problem for Target as it attempts to have a better 2026 than 2025 while new CEO Michael Fiddelke slides in.\n\nWalmart \u2014 by way of 4,700-plus US stores \u2014 is regularly delivering orders to people's houses in less than 30 minutes. By year-end, Walmart's US stores will be within a three-hour reach of 95% of the population. Walmart has leveraged its mighty financial position to invest aggressively in its supply chain, allowing it to be a more trusted destination for shoppers than Target.\n\nCouple that with a significantly expanded e-commerce assortment and a low-price commitment, and you have Walmart a country mile ahead of Target in meeting customers with how they shop nowadays.\n\nTo be fair, Amazon (AMZN) is doing this too \u2014 I was blown away by Amazon's supply chain projects when I caught up with CEO Andy Jassy a few months ago in New York City. There are real structural reasons why it feels like your Amazon package is showing up faster than ever before \u2014 and it's more than robots.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAll of this explains why Target announced this week that it will increase its capital expenditures by 25% next year. It called out a lot of investments to spruce up stores. But let me tell you \u2014 if Target doesn't invest a huge chunk in its supply chain to improve shipping times and online shopping, then 2026 will be financially disastrous again.\n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure if Target could close the competitive gap with Walmart at this point, but I wish them well in their pursuit.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

CEO Warren Buffett generally avoids tech stocks, as he largely focuses on companies in consumer goods, financials, and industrials. He is stepping down as CEO at the end of the year, and this could be a sign of a greater acceptance of tech moving forward.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway \u203a\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) has, for the most part, been selling stocks for much of the year, with its cash balance hitting record levels. CEO Warren Buffett doesn't appear to have been finding many bargains out there worth pursuing.\n\nThat's why Berkshire's latest move raised some eyebrows: adding Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) to its portfolio. Buffett generally avoids tech stocks, which leads many analysts to conclude the purchase wasn't made by him. And this could be a sign of many more changes to come, especially since the billionaire investor is stepping down at the end of the year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBuffett regretted not investing in Alphabet earlier\n\nAccording to Berkshire's 13F filing, the company owns approximately 17.8 million shares of Alphabet as of the end of September.\n\nAlphabet is what I'd consider to be a prototypical Buffett stock. It has two highly popular assets in Google Search and YouTube, which have strong competitive advantages that the billionaire investor often seeks out when finding blue chip stocks to invest in. They also have what he refers to as a \"share of mind,\" in that people often think of those brands and generally have good feelings about them.\n\nIn years past, Buffett admits to missing out on Google. And his partner, the late Charlie Munger, said that \"we just sat there sucking our thumbs,\" admitting that they saw the success the business had become, but failed to pull the trigger.\n\nThe big reason Buffett may have passed on the tech giant in the past is because he isn't overly comfortable investing in tech stocks; it's not within what he would say is in his \"circle of competence\" -- something he suggests investors stay within, to ensure they aren't investing in businesses they aren't familiar with.\n\nCould this move be a sign of greater changes ahead?\n\nFor Berkshire to now invest in Alphabet suggests to me that perhaps Greg Abel, Berkshire's incoming CEO, may be more willing to have the stock be among the company's top holdings. It could be a sign that, at the very least, there's going to be a greater appetite for tech stocks in Berkshire's portfolio in the near future, so Buffett didn't oppose this latest buy.\n\nThere are tech stocks in Berkshire's portfolio, but they are generally more modest positions. Amazon is a holding, but it accounts for just 0.7% of the entire portfolio. Alphabet, meanwhile, accounts for 1.7% right now. It's quickly become one of the larger holdings in the Berkshire portfolio, and I believe there could be more tech stocks to find their way there in the coming months.\n\nWhile this doesn't mean Berkshire's new management is necessarily going in a completely different direction than Buffett, but with different competencies, the new CEO may simply be more comfortable holding more of a position in tech.\n\nWhy a transition to tech could make Berkshire's stock an even better buy\n\nBerkshire's portfolio is full of recognizable consumer brands, which, unfortunately, may not make for great investments anymore. While Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz are well-known businesses and are top Berkshire holdings, both have significantly underperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) in the past five years; the former is up over 33%, while the latter has declined by 21%. By comparison, the broad index is up more than 83% during that time frame.\n\nA transition away from these types of slower-growing businesses and into more tech stocks could be a move that ends up paying off for investors. I wouldn't be surprised to see more of these types of moves in the future for Berkshire, as a change in management could mean a different mix of stocks for the company.\n\nWhile Buffett leaving the company may have investors worried about its future, I'm optimistic it could help reenergize its portfolio and lead to better returns in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

It\u2019s a tool to leverage. Use the stock\u2019s recent weakness to step into a stake in Coca-Cola. It won\u2019t remain \u201con sale\u201d forever. Shares of credit card middleman Visa are undervalued because the company\u2019s potential is being underestimated.10 stocks we like better than Microsoft \u203a\n\nWhen investors have some idle cash to put to work, most of the time, they'll look for stocks they don't already own. And for good reason. More diversification is a good thing.\n\nIt's not always easy to do, though. Sometimes the best stocks for a particular investor are already in their portfolio. In these instances, it's not wrong to buy more of a great name you're already holding.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three fantastic stocks you may well already own, but can safely double up on, especially following each ticker's recent weakness.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) may be an aging name contending with the downside of its sheer size. But this old dog's still got plenty of fight left in it. Last quarter's top line of $77.7 billion was up 18% year over year, with $30.8 billion of that being turned into net income. If the software giant is supposed to be past its prime, somebody clearly forget to give Microsoft the message.\n\nThis continued growth is rooted in two factors that aren't apt to unravel anytime soon... if ever.\n\nThe first of these is its sheer dominance. Not only does the company remain a powerhouse within the personal productivity software space, its Windows operating system is installed on roughly two-thirds of the world's computers, according to numbers from Statcounter. This degree of resilient market penetration suggests Microsoft has become a permanent fixture within the personal computing landscape.\n\nAnd the second factor behind the company's enduring strength? Its Windows operating system actually steers consumers and corporate clients alike to other Microsoft-made products and services like its Bing search engine, LinkedIn, and even its Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nThis brute strength obviously hasn't helped investors much of late. While shares haven't exactly performed poorly since July, they've not made any net progress either, missing out on the broad market's gains during this stretch.\n\nBlame growing worries about its artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, mostly. Although nobody denies it's doing great things on the AI front, investors are increasingly concerned that Microsoft is also competing with its own artificial intelligence partner OpenAI. It's still simply spending a ton of money on artificial intelligence as well, at a time when investors are starting to question most AI stocks' steep valuations; many of these companies have yet to produce the sort of ROI on these investments that the world was hoping to see by now.\n\nNow take a step back and look at the bigger picture. This is Microsoft. There's a reason the analyst community still contends the stock's worth $631.80, which is 28% above shares' present price. That reason is the unstoppability that comes with its sheer size and its must-have offerings.\n\n2. Coca-Cola\n\nIt's been an unusually tough year for Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) shareholders. Although the stock's bounced back somewhat from its midyear lull following a couple of red flags in recent earnings reports (the second quarter's total sales volume fell slightly year over year, for instance, following a warning with its first-quarter report that then-new tariffs could take a toll on its bottom line), it's still trading below April's high while the rest of the market isn't.\n\nAs is the case with Microsoft, though, it's not like Coca-Cola is in any real existential danger. It's the world's biggest, best-known beverage name for a reason, after all.\n\nThat reason is, over the course of its 139-year existence, it's gotten very, very good at marketing. It's more than a mere drinks company -- Coca-Cola is a lifestyle brand, with its flagship soda's name and logo appearing on everything from clothing to Christmas ornaments to home decor. That's powerful.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis durable marketability is only part of the reason you might want to buy Coca-Cola shares sooner than later, though, and not even the best reason. Far more compelling is the fact that you can step into this stock while its forward-looking dividend yield stands at a solid 2.9%. And that's based on a dividend, by the way, that's now been raised for 63 consecutive years.\n\n3. Visa\n\nFinally, add credit card powerhouse Visa(NYSE: V) to your list of stocks to double up on here, if you're struggling to find a new name you like well enough to add to your portfolio.\n\nAnyone keeping long-term tabs on this company likely knows last quarter's top-line growth of 12% is a bit above long-term norms, boosted by the swell of cross-border payments the company is now able to facilitate, and has reason to. As Visa Direct's Europe chief Anastasia Serikova noted earlier this year, \"Cross-border payments have seen substantial growth due to the increase in international trade, global workforce mobility, and remittances, with total global cross-border payment flows growing at around 9% (CAGR) annually.\"\n\nThis growth engine isn't apt to sputter to a stop in the foreseeable future, either. Serikova adds, \"With the increased mobility of people, goods, and services across borders, total cross-border payments are projected to reach $250 trillion by 2027, a $100 trillion increase from 2017.\"\n\nThen there's the other, largely overlooked reason to scoop up some/more shares of Visa in the wake of its pullback from its June peak. That is, while worries about its growth prospects, regulatory headwinds, competition, and the stock's steep valuation are all credible, what's not being priced in is Visa's potential upside from the use of artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nWhereas some institutions are utilizing AI simply for the sake of using it (without any clear positive impact), a complex, digitally focused, data-rich company like this payment middleman can actually do something constructive with artificial intelligence. This includes AI-powered customer service agents, data analysis, and cybersecurity in an industry that's highly vulnerable to fraud, just to name a few. It's actually a pretty big deal that's not being fully reflected in the stock's price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

Visa has a predictable runway for future growth. The payment processor just rewarded shareholders with over $22 billion in stock buybacks and dividends.10 stocks we like better than Visa \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) holds positions in over 40 publicly traded companies, six of which are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI).\n\nThe Dow has 30 components in total, and four out of five of Berkshire's largest holdings are Dow stocks: Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nAdditionally, Berkshire owns Amazon, which was added to the Dow last year, and Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nHere's why Visa is my top buy of these six names for 2026.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA high-margin cash cow\n\nBerkshire's public equity portfolio is worth approximately $302 billion. But its controlled businesses are arguably even more valuable. The crown jewel is its property and casualty insurance businesses. Given Berkshire's expertise in finding value in the financial sector, it's no surprise that it owns all three of the major credit card companies -- American Express, Visa, and Mastercard.\n\nVisa is the largest of the three, both in terms of market capitalization and transaction volume. The more cards that enter the Visa network, the greater the incentive for merchants worldwide to accept Visa, which boosts revenue that can be used to partner with even more financial institutions, in turn leading to more card issuances. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Visa is converting nearly half of its revenue into free cash flow (FCF) -- which showcases just how efficiently its business operates.\n\nV Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nVisa's main expenses are related to maintaining and expanding its network, labor, and marketing. It's a very capital-light business model, especially considering that Visa partners with financial institutions to issue cards. By not issuing its own cards, Visa doesn't have to worry about bearing the credit risk. So it's not liable for how responsibly or irresponsibly its card users manage their spending.\n\nAnother benefit is that it doesn't have to pay its users rewards. That's also done by financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase's Chase Sapphire and Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Bank of America Customer Cash Rewards card, or the Wells Fargo Active Cash card, which are all Visa cards. By comparison, American Express spends more than double on cardmember perks than it collects in annual fees (but it makes up for that shortfall in other ways).\n\nVisa passes along its free cash flow to shareholders\n\nVisa's high-margin business makes it arguably the greatest cash cow in the financial services industry.\n\nBecause Visa has low capital expenditures, it is able to convert nearly all of its operating cash flow into FCF. Visa returns that FCF to shareholders through dividends and more, importantly, stock buybacks. Metric Full Year Fiscal 2025 Net cash provided by operating activities $23.06 billion Capital expenditures $1.48 billion Free cash flow $21.58 billion Share repurchases $18.19 billion Dividends $4.63 billion\n\nData source: Visa. Fiscal year 2025 ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn Visa's 2025 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2025, the company returned roughly 4 times more cash through stock buybacks than dividends. Here lies Visa's ace in the hole. By using its FCF on buybacks over dividends, Visa consistently reduces its share count. With fewer shares to go around, Visa's earnings per share increase from the core business growing earnings as well as through a lower outstanding share count.\n\nBuybacks are a significant reason why Visa is still a good value. Despite Visa's stock price increasing over fourfold in the last decade, Visa's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still just 32.3 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is lower than its 10-year median P/E of 34.3.\n\nIf Visa were to reallocate share repurchases toward dividends, it would yield a whopping 3.6% instead of its actual yield of 0.8%. However, long-term investors would prefer Visa to continue buying back stock disproportionately and paying a relatively small dividend, as it's a better use of capital if the stock continues to perform well.\n\nYou can count on Visa in 2026 and beyond\n\nVisa checks all the boxes of a high-quality stock to buy now. Major indexes, such as the S&P 500, sport relatively expensive valuations because many of the largest companies by market capitalization have seen their stock prices rise faster than earnings, which puts pressure on these companies to deliver on expectations.\n\nVisa doesn't have that problem because its valuation is reasonable. And yet, it's not a stodgy, low-growth stock like Coca-Cola, where investors can only pencil in mid-single-digit annual earnings growth. Visa should continue to grow earnings in the low double digits per year, even if consumer spending declines.\n\nAdd it all up, and Visa is one of my highest-conviction buys for 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

Note that the tech giant's stock was far cheaper when Berkshire bought it. 10 stocks we like better than Alphabet \u203a\n\nWhen you think of the stocks that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) and its legendary CEO, Warren Buffett, invest in, it's usually stalwart companies like Coca-Cola, insurance businesses, and railroads that come to mind. One of its most famous investments is Apple, which it bought as a value investment and is a fairly simple operation to understand.\n\nBerkshire isn't known to invest in cutting-edge technologies and prefers proven businesses with strong cash flows. So hearing that Berkshire invested in a company with quantum computing aspirations is surprising. But when you dig into this recent investment, it's clear that it fits the Berkshire mold nicely.\n\nSo, what is this new quantum computing investment Berkshire just made? It's none other than Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet's quantum computing efforts are impressive\n\nDuring Q3, Berkshire Hathaway took a position in Alphabet. We don't know for sure if Buffett was the one who made the purchase, as it could have been Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who are known to make more tech-centric investments.\n\nFurthermore, Buffett is on his way out as CEO and is stepping down at the end of the year. So it's possible that Buffett had nothing to do with the purchase, but he has long been a fan of Alphabet.\n\nBuffett previously said that he \"blew it\" by not investing in Alphabet (owner of the Google Search engine) earlier when he noted that Geico, one of Buffett's legendary insurance investments, was paying them each time a Google Search directed traffic to Geico's website. Investors shouldn't be surprised that Berkshire eventually came around to owning Alphabet, but what about its quantum computing endeavors?\n\nBuffett and Berkshire have long advocated for businesses that are fairly simple and can be easily understood. Quantum computing is certainly not that. However, it's unlikely that Berkshire purchased shares of Alphabet because of its quantum computing investments, even though they are impressive.\n\nGoogle's Willow quantum computing chip recently ran the first verifiable quantum computing algorithm -- 13,000 times faster than the world's fastest supercomputer. That's an incredible improvement, but it's not so fast that the results from the quantum computer couldn't be verified by classical computing technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAlphabet has more resources than nearly any competitor in the quantum computing arms race could dream of, making it a top contender in this realm. If Google's quantum computing technology becomes the ultimate winner in the space, it could be a nice boost to the base business, which is the real reason why Berkshire invested in Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet checks a lot of Berkshire investment boxes\n\nAlphabet's base advertising business is still growing despite its maturity. Google search revenue was up 15% in the third quarter, and is likely being boosted by its integration of generative AI and traditional search. A strong base business with massive cash flows is something that Berkshire looks for, and it likely isn't concerned with Alphabet's other bets like quantum computing and self-driving cars.\n\nBerkshire and Buffett have primarily followed a value investing philosophy over the past 50 years. With Berkshire scooping up Alphabet's stock for about $200 per share, they likely purchased Alphabet's stock for about 19 times forward earnings.GOOGL data by YCharts\n\nAlphabet's stock has risen quite a bit since then, but I still think that it's a solid stock to buy right now. It has a ton of momentum in the artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing space, which will boost growth rates alongside its strong advertising business. With long-shot investments such as quantum computing also being made, it has several potential winners growing under its umbrella.\n\nWhether it was Buffett who made the Alphabet purchase or not for Berkshire doesn't matter; Alphabet checks a lot of the boxes that Berkshire looks for in an investment, and I think it's primed for even more upside in 2026 and beyond.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

That's why dividend stocks can be a valuable piece of virtually anyone's portfolio. They reward investors for simply holding on to them.\n\nHowever, not all dividend stocks are alike. Some companies' dividends are at risk of being cut or eliminated because of poor business and financial performance. If you're looking for the smartest dividend stock to buy right now, it'd be one where you don't have to second-guess the stability of its dividend. That's the case with Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO).Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCoca-Cola is a Dividend King, having increased its annual dividend for at least 50 consecutive years (it's currently at 63 years). That's a title that only a small number of companies hold, and one that shows Coca-Cola's longevity, consistency, and shareholder-friendly nature.\n\nWhen you invest in Coca-Cola, you know you're investing in one of the world's most thorough businesses. It has a stronghold on the non-alcoholic beverage market, and its products sell regardless of economic conditions. This has been a recipe for its sustained success, and there are no signs of this changing for the foreseeable future.\n\nCoca-Cola's average dividend yield over the past five years has been around 3%. If that average were to continue, a $1,000 investment would pay out $30 annually. That's not yacht-shopping money, but it can pay off over time as it adds to the natural compound effect of investing.

Currency fluctuations continue to be a recurring drag on reported earnings. Coca-Cola\u2019s reliance on bottlers introduces operational risk. 10 stocks we like better than Coca-Cola \u203a\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) has established one of the most resilient business models in the consumer goods industry. But even a company with a century of brand strength and global distribution isn't immune to long-term risks. Some are slow-moving structural trends, while others come from economic or regulatory forces that may reshape the beverage landscape over time.\n\nThere are three most significant risks investors should keep on their radar. Here's why each one matters for Coca-Cola's long-term outlook.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Health trends and sugar regulation are long-term headwinds\n\nCoca-Cola's most significant risk isn't new, but it's becoming more critical: Global consumption is shifting toward healthier beverages. Governments are becoming more aggressive about sugar regulation, and many consumers -- especially younger ones -- are cutting back on sugary sodas.\n\nAround the world, sugar taxes have already been introduced in dozens of countries. More regulations are expected, from front-of-pack warning labels to restrictions on advertising and portion sizes. These rules raise prices, reduce affordability, and ultimately weigh on volumes.\n\nCoca-Cola has made progress with Coke Zero Sugar and reformulated products, but its identity is still closely tied to its core cola products. That's both a strength and a constraint. While health-focused trends evolve slowly, they have a marginal impact on consumption, and their cumulative effect over many years can be significant.\n\nFor investors, this risk isn't about a sudden collapse in demand -- it's about structural volume pressure that may limit how quickly Coca-Cola can grow, especially in developed markets.\n\n2. Currency fluctuations can drag on reported earnings\n\nMore than half of Coca-Cola's revenue comes from outside the U.S., and that global footprint exposes the company to foreign exchange volatility. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, Coca-Cola's reported revenue and profits fall -- even if the company sells the same number of units overseas.\n\nFX volatility is a recurring issue that investors often underestimate. In many years, FX alone has cut Coca-Cola's reported revenue growth by a few percentage points. For instance, currency fluctuations reduced groupwide revenue by 5% in 2024, driven by a 14%-16% impact in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa regions, as well as Latin America. Over time, that creates a real drag on earnings momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoca-Cola can hedge selectively, but it can't eliminate currency exposure. It's part of the company's structure. And because the business relies heavily on emerging markets for future growth -- regions more prone to currency fluctuations -- FX risk is likely to remain relevant.\n\nIn short, while the long-term business is likely to emerge fine, short-term earnings volatility is a reality shareholders must accept.\n\n3. Dependence on bottlers can create operational friction.\n\nCoca-Cola's asset-light model is one of its biggest strengths, but it also introduces a risk that investors sometimes overlook. By outsourcing manufacturing and distribution to bottlers, Coca-Cola gives up a level of direct operational control. When bottlers face inflation, labor shortages, or supply chain challenges, product availability and service levels can be affected.\n\nAnd because Coca-Cola doesn't run these operations itself, fixing problems isn't always done quickly. In some cases, local bottlers may struggle to invest in new equipment or maintain cold-chain reliability during periods of economic hardship. That can impact brand perception, especially in markets where consistent distribution is most crucial.\n\nCoca-Cola has spent years consolidating its bottlers to improve efficiency; however, the model still relies on a network of partners with varying cost structures, incentives, and financial positions. When conditions are stable, the system runs smoothly. When inflation spikes or logistics get disrupted, bottler execution becomes a meaningful swing factor.\n\nInvestors should view this as the trade-off that comes with high margins: Coca-Cola keeps attractive profits, but bottlers manage the complexity -- which can spill over into business performance.\n\nWhat does it mean for investors?\n\nCoca-Cola's long-term story is about stability. The company's brand, pricing power, and distribution moat are all real advantages. However, even the most successful business models come with risks.\n\nHealth trends and sugar regulation create structural pressure. Currency volatility introduces unpredictable swings in reported earnings. And reliance on bottlers means Coca-Cola's operations are only as strong as the partners that execute its strategy on the ground.\n\nNone of these risks breaks the Coca-Cola thesis. However, they shape the pace and consistency of future growth -- and they're worth tracking for investors holding the stock for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

The bi-annual event, which has been established as the premier convening for decision-makers at the intersection of creativity and artificial intelligence, brought together handpicked leaders from Fortune 500 companies, major studios, and pioneering creative enterprises at The Preserve in Hollywood.\n\nThe LA summit featured executives and innovators from Mattel, Coca-Cola, AWS, Cosm, Adobe, Lovable, alongside Emmy-winning filmmakers, visual artists, and AI pioneers like Grimes and Shantell Martin. The event sparked critical conversations about how AI is reshaping not just creative production, but the very nature of meaning, authorship, and human expression in the digital age.\n\nThree Defining Themes Emerged from the Summit\n\nCreativity at the \"Speed of Culture\": Artists highlighted AI's role in enabling unprecedented creative velocity. Emmy-winning filmmaker Jason Zada produced a music video with will.i.am in three days that gained 30M+ views in a week, noting, \"For the first time, we could move at the speed of culture.\" Visual artist Shantell Martin noted that AI systems allow her to circumnavigate traditional linear workflows and explore creative directions simultaneously. Mindaugas Petrutis, Creator Lead at Lovable, summarized the democratizing potential: \"Only 1% of people in the world can code, but 99% of us have great ideas, and AI tools are finally empowering that 99% to create things themselves.\" The Human Fingerprint \u2013 Intentionality Over Output: As AI raises baseline production quality, speakers emphasized that human choice has never been more crucial. Matt Zien articulated what he calls the emerging \"meaning economy\": Artist and musician Grimes called for \"approaching it with moral philosophy\" as artists navigate new tools, while Christopher Sinnott, Spatial Computing and Immersive Technology at AWS, observed: \"The best of AI has human fingerprints all over it.\" Design Thinking: Building New Worlds: Summit speakers outlined a blueprint for creative leadership in the AI era that emphasizes building over consuming tools. Dom Heinrich, Global Head of AI Design at The Coca-Cola Company, and other speakers championed purposeful expansion of cognitive scope to shape new cultural experiences. The focus shifted from mastering specific platforms to cultivating a builder mentality, asking not \"how do I use this tool?\" but \"what do I want to build, and what will allow me to do that?\"\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"We are at an urgent moment when AI is profoundly impacting our self-perception as humans, leaders, and creators,\" said Dani Van de Sande, Founder of Artist and the Machine. \"The LA summit proved that when you bring innovators across disciplines into the same room for human-centric, creative-first dialogue, you unlock insights that go far beyond efficiency narratives. We're excited to continue this conversation in New York.\"\n\n\u201cAt Lovable, we\u2019re trying to make software creation feel as natural as picking up a pen or a brush,\u201d said Mindaugas Petrutis, Creator Lead at Lovable. \u201cFor years, there\u2019s been this idea that physical art and technology live in separate worlds, and that AI threatens what artists do. What we\u2019re seeing here is the opposite. Lovable gives artists a way to extend their work into new spaces, without losing the soul of what makes it theirs. Watching Shantell M and Moral Turgeman bring a piece they\u2019ve been dreaming about for a decade into an interactive, living environment has been incredible. What we wanted to show with this collaboration is possibility, that artists can use tools like Lovable to expand their practice, invite people into the work, and feel empowered rather than replaced.\u201d\n\nNew York Summit: May 14, 2026\r\nThe May 2026 New York summit will build on the momentum from Los Angeles, convening another carefully curated group of creative leaders, technology innovators, and brand executives to explore the evolving relationship between human creativity and machine intelligence.\n\nFor more information about Artist and the Machine and to apply for attendance, visit https://artistandthemachine.com/\n\nAbout Artist and the Machine\r\nArtist and the Machine is the leading Summit at the forefront of AI & Creativity.

The company\u2019s global distribution network forms a moat built over decades. Coca-Cola\u2019s brand -- known around the globe -- gives it enormous pricing power. 10 stocks we like better than Coca-Cola \u203a\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) has been around for over a century, and during that time consumer habits, distribution channels, and entire industries have undergone significant changes.\n\nYet one thing has remained remarkably consistent: Coca-Cola continues to operate one of the strongest, most durable business models in the global consumer goods industry. The company doesn't rely on rapid reinvention to stay relevant. Instead, it leans on a system that has quietly delivered steady growth, predictable cash flow, and unmatched global reach for generations.\n\nWhat makes Coca-Cola's business model work so well -- even after 100 years? It comes down to three strengths that have proven themselves through wars, recessions, inflation cycles, and shifting consumer preferences.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. An asset-light business model built to last\n\nCoca-Cola's most significant advantage is its asset-light \"concentrate model.\" The company doesn't shoulder the heavy burden of manufacturing or distribution. Instead, it focuses on brand building, product strategy, and producing the concentrate that bottlers use to make finished drinks. Everything else -- plants, equipment, trucks, and local logistics \u2013 goes to the bottling partners. This setup gives Coca-Cola three significant long-term benefits:\n\nConsistently high operating margins Very low capital expenditure requirements Strong and steady free cash flow, regardless of the economic cycle\n\nThe structure has withstood decades of economic volatility. When inflation pushes up the cost of fuel, labor, or packaging, bottlers absorb the pressure first. Coca-Cola still collects high-margin concentrate revenue. This model helped Coca-Cola expand globally throughout the 20th century and remains effective to this day.\n\nEven as consumer companies struggle with rising costs and supply chain issues, Coca-Cola's financial results remain resilient. For instance, the company reported a 5% increase in revenue and 15% higher non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) operating income in the third quarter of 2025. That's the value of a system designed for longevity rather than temporary growth spurts.\n\n2. A distribution moat that's almost impossible to replicate\n\nCoca-Cola's extensive distribution network is another key factor in the company's enduring success after 100 years. Through its bottlers, Coca-Cola has established one of the most extensive beverage distribution systems in the world.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIts products are available in millions of retail outlets, restaurants, convenience stores, and public spaces worldwide. This presence is supported by:\n\nBranded coolers and refrigerators Fountain dispensers Vending machines Decades-long relationships with small retailers\n\nThese aren't just distribution points. They're durable pieces of infrastructure that are hard to displace. If a store has a Coca-Cola fridge, it expects to stock Coca-Cola products. That cooler becomes long-term shelf space that competitors must fight to access -- and usually fail to win.\n\nThis is not a moat that newcomers can replicate even in a decade. It's the result of slow, consistent investment over generations. Of course, Coke still faces competition from its major peer, PepsiCo, but the duopoly has been competing and remains enormously successful over the decades.\n\nEven as online grocery and delivery apps reshape how consumers buy beverages, Coca-Cola's physical footprint gives it a natural advantage. Presence still matters, and Coca-Cola may have the most valuable physical presence in the global beverage industry.\n\n3. Pricing power rooted in one of the world's strongest brands\n\nFinally, Coca-Cola benefits from pricing power that few consumer companies can match. The brand is instantly recognizable, trusted, and part of daily life in many markets. That familiarity gives the company meaningful pricing flexibility, a strength that has become especially important during recent inflation cycles.\n\nFor perspective, the beverage company reported 11% growth in price and mix, significantly outpacing the 2% increase in concentrate sales volume for 2024. That's precisely what pricing power looks like: the ability to raise prices while maintaining moderate volume growth.\n\nThis strength has supported Coca-Cola through numerous inflation cycles spanning its over-100-year history. While the products evolve -- from classic Coca-Cola to Coke Zero to newer flavors and functional beverages -- the brand equity behind them continues to carry significant economic weight.\n\nIn short, pricing power is one of the clearest indicators of a durable brand, and Coca-Cola has consistently demonstrated this durability for generations.\n\nWhat does it mean for investors?\n\nCoca-Cola's business model isn't exciting -- and that's precisely why it remains effective. The asset-light concentrate structure, global distribution moat, and pricing power have all proven effective over decades of economic change. These strengths give Coca-Cola steady margins, predictable cash flow, and durable competitive advantages.\n\nFor long-term investors looking for reliability in a volatile market, the stock is worth paying attention to.\n\nShould you buy stock in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

It just doesn't matter. If and when these stocks finally suffer their long-overdue valuation correction, it will take a while, and will likely create a ripple effect that drags on the rest of the market ... and the economy itself. Specifically, Goldman believes shrinking premium valuations will effectively work against the market's net progress by about 1% per year through 2035.\n\nThen there are interest rates. As the report goes on to explain, much of the widening of the S&P 500's profit margins since 1990 \"has been attributable to falling interest rates and corporate tax rates, neither of which appears likely to decline as substantially during the next decade.\"\n\nInvestors had to know this day of reckoning was coming sooner or later, of course.\n\nAnd yet, Goldman isn't exactly discouraging investors from getting into and remaining in the stock market. It's just saying investors might want to adapt accordingly, by favoring stocks other than the market's present darlings.\n\nTime for some strategic tweaking\n\nThe thing is, the lackluster outlook in question is mostly an American-centric concern. Plenty of other regions are expected to fare better, like Japan, as well as the rest of Asia. Their average market growth outlooks for the coming 10 years are 8.2% and 10.3%, respectively, while emerging markets are expected to dish out average annualized returns of 10.9% through 2035, all led by raw earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis dynamic puts foreign stocks like China's Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) and South America's MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) -- the so-called Amazon of Latin America -- into the spotlight. While Alibaba's roots are in the e-commerce realm, its top growth engine for the coming decade is likely to be artificial intelligence. It's even developed its own AI processing chip that's competitive with hardware made by Nvidia. Meanwhile, MercadoLibre is capitalizing on the rapid proliferation of web-connected smartphones in South America, driving its top line 39% higher (or 49% higher on a constant-currency basis) for the three-month stretch ending in September alone, extending well-established trends.\n\nMercadoLibre and Alibaba also bring something else strategic to the table. That's the fact that both American depositary receipts -- or ADRs -- are denominated in U.S. dollars at a time when Goldman's strategists feel the greenback is about 15% overvalued. As this premium unwinds and reinflates other countries' currencies, it could add approximately 2 percentage points' worth of net growth to most foreign stocks every year through 2035.\n\nThen there's the other outcome of this paradigm shift. Although Goldman's researchers didn't explicitly recommend dividend stocks as a means of beating the market for the next 10 years, the report repeatedly points out that dividends will make up an important part of the total returns from every region's stocks during the decade ahead.\n\nThis bodes well for dividend-focused companies like Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) as well as drugmakers like Pfizer(NYSE: PFE) and Merck(NYSE: MRK). In fact, both pharmaceutical stocks offer above-average yields right now thanks to weakness linked to unwarranted worries that neither has the brightest of foreseeable futures. They do! Merck, for instance, contends its current developmental pipeline could be generating as much as $50 billion in yearly revenue by the mid-2030s, eventually replacing its cancer-fighting Keytruda, which currently accounts for half of its sales but will begin losing the crux of its patent protection in 2028. Its dividend payments should remain intact.\n\nDon't panic -- just adapt\n\nLike any other outlook, take Goldman's with a grain of salt. It acknowledges it's only a best guess using information that's currently available, and could ultimately be wrong.\n\nStill, as veteran investors can attest, the market is forever changing. While philosophical strategies like index-based investing with instruments such the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY) never really go out of style even in subpar market environments, it would be na\u00efve to believe the next few years will look precisely like the last few have when so much has changed... like interest rates, the U.S. government's massive debt overhang, tense trade relations, and the advent of AI that's made so many foreign companies surprisingly competitive so quickly.

Investors are worried about debt levels and volume growth. The stock isn\u2019t a lost cause, but an earnest rebound could take time to materialize. 10 stocks we like better than PepsiCo \u203a\n\nFor all the talk about the wind possibly coming out of the sails of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, a real sector rotation hasn't played out.\n\nRecent headlines suggest investors are skittish about what the near term holds for growth and technology stocks. Such jitters often compel market participants to move into defensive sectors, but broadly speaking, consumer staples stocks -- a defensive group to be sure -- aren't responding.PepsiCo's stock is slumping. A rebound, though possible, could take some time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDown 2.16% year to date, the stock of PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) is one of the Consumer Staples sector's disappointments. Making PepsiCo's lethargy even harder to swallow for investors is that rival Coca-Cola is up more than 14% in 2025 and keeping up with the S&P 500 in the process. Combine those factors, and it might be hard to be bullish on the Gatorade maker, but there's a case for a rebound if the company can allay shareholders' concerns on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, the bad news for PepsiCo\n\nOne strike against PepsiCo is that its debt levels have grown much more rapidly than those of Coca-Cola. At the end of the third quarter, PepsiCo carried long-term debt of $44.13 billion, a 14.61% year-over-year increase, extending a lengthy run during which its liabilities ballooned faster than its competitors.Data by YCharts.\n\nStrike two is the fact that PepsiCo's 2025 organic sales growth has been anemic, and global volumes have declined in each of the first three quarters of the year. One way of looking at those trends, at least as they relate to the U.S., is that at a time when some shoppers view the Consumer Price Index\u00a0as still being elevated, the company can't price its way into revenue growth.\n\nStrike three is more of an interesting fact. PepsiCo is no longer on the podium of the most popular sodas. That's right: not even a bronze medal as Coca-Cola Classic, Dr. Pepper, and Coke's Sprite are the medalists, with PepsiCo ranking fourth in popularity. As someone who grew up during the cola wars of the 1980s, this is stunning.\n\nHow PepsiCo can get its groove back\n\nOne of the investment cases for PepsiCo, although the news is priced into the stock, is the involvement of Elliott Investment Management, which took a $4 billion stake in the company in September. The stock hasn't done much of anything since then, but know this: Activist investors don't get involved unless they sense an opportunity to come out on top.\n\nStory Continues\n\nElliott has made clear it wants PepsiCo to spin off its North American bottling operations -- something Coca-Cola has already done -- and perhaps prune its sprawling brand portfolio. In theory, PepsiCo retaining its North American bottling unit is sensible because it gives it control over the process, but the reality is much different. In the soda margin fight, Coca-Cola comes out far ahead because it doesn't bottle its own drinks.\n\nThe brand-paring option has some viability as well because PepsiCo controls 60 brands, according to its website. By parting ways with a few, it could streamline its operations, raise cash to lower debt, and simplify its investment story.\n\nReducing debt is always a good thing.

Let's break down what makes this iconic stock tick and whether there's real value beneath the brand. Coca-Cola's shares have climbed 15.2% year-to-date and 15.0% over the last year, with the latest close at $71.21. This hints at renewed investor optimism and possibly changing risk perceptions. Recent news has highlighted Coca-Cola's new product launches aimed at healthier beverage options and expanded partnerships across emerging markets. These moves are catching both investors' and competitors' attention, helping fuel the current share price momentum. On our value scorecard, Coca-Cola scores 3 out of 6 for undervaluation. This is solid, but perhaps not the full story. We'll dig into the classic valuation methods next, and at the end, reveal an even better way to assess Coca-Cola's true value.\n\nCoca-Cola delivered 15.0% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Beverage industry.\n\nApproach 1: Coca-Cola Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\n\nThe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its expected future cash flows and then discounting those amounts back to present-day dollars. For Coca-Cola, this involves analyzing the company's ability to generate cash well into the future and translating those figures into a single, current value per share.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s most recent annual Free Cash Flow stands at $5.6 billion. Analyst consensus projects strong growth, with cash flow estimates rising to $15.2 billion by 2029. It is worth noting that while analyst projections only cover five years, Simply Wall St extrapolates further growth based on trends and historical performance to fill out the next decade.\n\nAccording to this DCF analysis, the intrinsic value per share for Coca-Cola is $89.90, which puts it at a 20.8% discount compared to the recent market price of $71.21 per share. By this measure, Coca-Cola stock currently appears undervalued.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUED\n\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Coca-Cola is undervalued by 20.8%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover 916 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows.KO Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Coca-Cola.\n\nApproach 2: Coca-Cola Price vs Earnings (PE Ratio)\n\nFor established, profitable companies like Coca-Cola, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used and reliable metric for valuation. It tells us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company\u2019s earnings. This provides a snapshot of whether the market believes future prospects justify the current price.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInterpreting the \"right\" PE ratio involves looking at the company's growth potential and how risky it is compared to other options. Faster-growing or less risky companies can justify higher PE ratios. In contrast, slower growers or riskier businesses typically trade at lower multiples.\n\nCoca-Cola is currently trading at a PE ratio of 23.5x. When benchmarked against the broader Beverage industry\u2019s average of 17.6x and peers at 26.5x, Coca-Cola sits near the middle. While this might suggest it is valued fairly, it is important to look more closely.\n\nThis is where Simply Wall St\u2019s \"Fair Ratio\" comes in. The Fair Ratio, set at 22.7x for Coca-Cola, is calculated using a proprietary model that considers crucial factors such as the company\u2019s future earnings growth, profit margins, market cap, industry landscape, and specific risks. This approach goes beyond simple peer or industry comparisons by reflecting the unique qualities and opportunities facing Coca-Cola right now.\n\nWith a current PE ratio of 23.5x and a Fair Ratio of 22.7x, Coca-Cola appears to be valued about in line with expectations. The slight difference between the two is minimal and indicates the market price accurately reflects the company\u2019s prospects and risks at this time.\n\nResult: ABOUT RIGHTNYSE:KO PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\n\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1422 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth.\n\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Coca-Cola Narrative\n\nEarlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your personal story, the perspective or thesis you bring to a company, mapped directly into the numbers: your assumptions about fair value, future revenue, profits, and margins.\n\nNarratives link the company\u2019s journey and unique context to a specific financial outlook and, from there, to an estimated fair value. This approach lets you move beyond generic ratios or consensus targets and build your own investment case in an interactive, straightforward way, all through Simply Wall St\u2019s Community page, where millions of investors share and update their Narratives every day.\n\nWith Narratives, you can clarify if a stock is a buy, hold, or sell by comparing your calculated Fair Value to the current Price. This helps you act with confidence instead of getting stuck on static ratios. Narratives are also dynamic; when new news or quarterly earnings appear, they update instantly so you always have the freshest view on what matters most.\n\nFor example, some investors interpreting Coca-Cola\u2019s future expect a fair value near $67.50, while others with a more bullish outlook see it around $77.50 or higher. This reflects different beliefs and scenarios about its growth and resilience.\n\nFor Coca-Cola however, we\u2019ll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Coca-Cola Narratives:\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Coca-Cola Bull Case\n\nFair Value: $77.57\n\nUndervalued by approximately 8.2%\n\nProjected Revenue Growth: 5.3%\n\nContinued expansion in emerging markets, digital initiatives, and value-added products are set to drive revenue and margin growth. Sustainability, asset-light strategy, and e-commerce investments are expected to boost brand equity and operational efficiency, supporting long-term earnings. Key risks include shifting health trends, intensifying competition, supply chain pressures, and regulatory uncertainty, all of which could constrain profitability and adaptability.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Coca-Cola Bear Case\n\nFair Value: $71.00\n\nCurrently trading about 0.3% above narrative fair value\n\nProjected Revenue Growth: 6.6%\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s resilient business model and dividend history appeal to conservative investors seeking dependable returns. The stock\u2019s valuation appears rich relative to potential macro headwinds, shifting consumer trends, and increased risks in emerging markets. Challenges include currency volatility, evolving health regulations, rising input costs, and environmental concerns linked to sustainability commitments.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Coca-Cola?

The companies Buffett likes to invest in don't focus on hype or short-term cycles. Instead, they survive by delivering products and services people use every day, regardless of market conditions.\n\nQuick Read\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) has never sold a single share of Coca-Cola since first purchasing in the late 1980s. Berkshire invested $4.3B in Alphabet during Q3 2025 after Buffett expressed regret for missing earlier opportunities. Berkshire has held American Express continuously since 1991 without selling any shares. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUltimately, Buffett's style of investing rewards patience, and it's because of this that he has become not just one of the world's best investors but also one of the richest people in history. His methodology rewards buying companies that compound over decades, not just a strong quarter here and there.\n\nIt's this philosophy that Berkshire Hathaway was built around, and the stocks he has held the longest all share the same traits. Of course, Buffett is also looking for new companies that can meet this same criteria.\n\nWhy Buffett Gravitates Toward Businesses With Moats\n\nOver time, the world has learned that Warren Buffett seeks companies that can defend their market positions. He's long looked for brand strength, customer loyalty, scale advantages, and predictable cash generation. It's these traits that have rewarded Buffett's investments as his picks allow earnings to compound steadily and over time. Unsurprisingly, the world knows and watches as he also seeks consistent dividends, which Buffett has long argued is a clear sign that management is prioritizing long-term value creation.\n\nIt's these companies below that reflect Buffett's mindset, past and present, and each one has the exact right blend of stability, competitive strength, and reliable shareholder returns.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's hard to imagine a clearer example of Warren Buffett's investing philosophy at work than it is with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). That Buffett has never sold a single share of Coca-Cola exemplifies his holding \"forever\" investment philosophy. Unsurprisingly, Coca-Cola is a company that sells beverages that people buy in both good and bad markets, so there is a steady demand that supports consistent cash flow and has long allowed this beverage favorite to maintain its long history of shareholder returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCurrently, Coca-Cola is paying a dividend yield of 2.87% and an annual dividend of $2.04, all while providing shareholders with a 16.7% year-to-date return in 2025 and a 5-year return of 55.69%. It's these numbers that prove Buffett's belief that by keeping the business model simple, the Coca-Cola brand has remained globally dominant, all while focusing on shareholder returns as a central part of management's philosophy.\n\nAmerican Express\n\nAnother cornerstone of the Berkshire portfolio, along with Coca-Cola, is American Express (NYSE:AXP), the company Buffett has refused to sell a single share of since he first purchased shares in 1991. Well, this story comes with a caveat, as he originally purchased in 1964 and sold his first $13 million investment in the company in 1968, making a 150% return. After purchasing again in August 1991, Buffett hasn't sold a single share of this second investment, and it speaks to his favorite type of stock almost immediately. American Express has a moat from its closed-loop network, premium customer base, and global brand.\n\nAmerican Express also offers a 0.95% dividend yield, but an annual dividend of $3.28 per share, and the company has grown its dividend for the last three years straight, reflecting its strong profitability. That Buffett hasn't sold any shares since 1991 is a definitive look at how Buffett looks at stocks that can protect themselves throughout different market conditions.\n\nAlphabet\n\nA more recent addition to Warren Buffett's portfolio, the acquisition of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock in the third quarter of 2025, indicates that his favorite type of stock hasn't wavered. Having expressed regret for not investing in both 2017 and 2019 and for \"blew it,\" Buffett has made up for that mistake by purchasing almost $4.3 billion in Alphabet stock.\n\nWhat makes this notable is that even against regulatory noise, Buffett sees what the best investors know in that Alphabet is a dominant force in search, cloud services, YouTube, email, and AI infrastructure. Revenue growth of 16% in Q3 2025 and strong EPS performance support Buffett's view that Alphabet's business is fundamentally sound. For shareholders, the 0.29% dividend yield and $0.84 dividend won't jump out as making anyone rich, but the exceptionally low 8.29% percent payout ratio leaves plenty of room for future dividend increases, and it's likely that Alphabet will want to raise the stakes as part of a multi-decade shareholder return strategy.\n\nUltimately, all three of these stocks reflect qualities that Buffett has long valued, and it's these qualities that define his favorite type of stock. Coca-Cola, American Express, and Alphabet all sell or provide services people use every day, and they generate steady cash flow through every market cycle and reward long-term shareholders with dependable income and rising value. Buffett has shown for decades that durable brands and consistent earnings matter more than hype or headlines.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

After years of chasing high-growth tech companies in a zero-interest-rate environment, many investors are now seeking more stable, income-generating assets amid economic uncertainty and falling interest rates. The spectacular run-up in tech valuations, particularly in AI-related stocks, has left many investors concerned about stretched valuations and the sustainability of growth narratives, prompting a defensive shift toward companies that can demonstrate profitability and return cash to shareholders. Especially since, according to Bloomberg, the Magnificent 7 are spending less on buybacks and more on capital expenditures.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points\n\nData is increasingly showing that investors are moving from tech giants to dividend-paying blue-chip stocks.

But that latter profile has taken a hit in recent weeks, as the likes of Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ: ORCL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN),\u00a0 and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) tap the credit market for billions to fund artificial intelligence projects. The result is the first sustained selloff for the group since April, with the Nasdaq 100 leading the broader market lower as investors ditch tech winners in favor of more defensive stocks. One of the beneficiaries: companies with juicy dividend payments. That group, which includes old-economy stalwarts, is often coveted when riskier stocks start to look expensive. They also tend to be calmer in times of turbulence. The Cboe Volatility Index jumped above 24 on Tuesday (11/18), surpassing its long-term average of 19.\n\nBlue-chip stocks are shares of large, well-established, financially stable companies with a consistent and reliable performance history. They are often considered less risky and are a popular choice for long-term investors. Additionally, nearly all leaders in the category pay dependable, recurring dividends each quarter, regardless of the state of the economy.

The assay is an industry-first all-in-one quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based test developed in collaboration with Coca-Cola Europacific Partners.\n\nThe latest development is an addition to the company\u2019s Thermo Scientific SureTect PCR System. The assay offers early and accurate detection of spoilage organisms earlier in the production process and has wide applicability across the beverage testing industry.\n\nLikely Trend of TMO Stock Following the News\n\nFollowing yesterday\u2019s announcement, TMO shares fell 0.4% to close at $573.79.\n\nOn a positive note, in recent years, Thermo Fisher has steadily increased its investment in R&D. The company is launching a slew of products, enhancing its portfolio. We expect the latest development to boost the market sentiment toward TMO stock in the upcoming days.\n\nPresently, Thermo Fisher boasts a market capitalization of $216.42 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate forecasts a 3.9% increase in the company\u2019s earnings and 3.2% growth in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. TMO beat on earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 2.3%.\n\nAbout Thermo Scientific SureTect Beverage Spoilage Multiplex qPCR Assay\n\nThe Thermo Scientific SureTect Beverage Spoilage Multiplex qPCR assay detects more than 100 strains of the most relevant spoilage micro-organisms for beverages, such as preservative-resistant yeasts, molds, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria in a single qPCR reaction \u2014 something no other test on the market currently offers.\n\nBy reducing testing time by as much as 50% relative to traditional culture testing methods, this high-throughput approach enhances manufacturers\u2019 assurance in batch release and strengthens consumers\u2019 trust in the quality of the beverages they consume. By testing for more micro-organisms in one assay, the all-in-one kit also enables cost efficiency and improved environmental sustainability.\n\nImportance of Thermo Scientific SureTect Beverage Spoilage Multiplex qPCR Assay\n\nProduct recalls due to microbial spoilage continue to pose a significant risk to beverage makers, affecting quality, brand reputation and revenues. Traditional contamination testing methods can take days and may miss certain problematic micro-organisms, putting companies at risk of costly recalls and eroded consumer trust. As beverage companies ramp up innovation, especially with limited-edition and seasonal offerings, speed and confidence in quality testing become even more critical.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIndustry Prospects Favor TMO\n\nAs per DelveInsight, the global PCR market size was valued at $4.90 billion in 2021, witnessing a CAGR of 8.7% during 2022-2027 to reach $8.04 billion by 2027. The rise in the prevalence of diseases caused by pathogens, the upsurge in technological innovations, and the increasing applications of PCR in clinical diagnostics are the key factors driving market growth.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother Recent Development by TMO\n\nThermo Fisher recently opened its East Coast flagship Advanced Therapies Collaboration Center (ATxCC) in Philadelphia, marking the company\u2019s second ATxCC in the United States.

After a period of margin pressure caused by inflation, higher global input costs and ongoing supply-chain volatility, management is sharpening execution to rebuild profitability. The company has been clear that right-sizing its entire cost base, through automation, SKU rationalization, labor restructuring and network simplification, will be the financial engine that fuels a faster, innovation-led growth trajectory. With International continuing to deliver resilient mid-single-digit organic growth and North America showing early signs of stabilization, PepsiCo is positioning 2025 as a reset year built on disciplined operational tightening.\r\n\r\nA major part of PepsiCo\u2019s plan is boosting productivity. The company has cut more than 35% of SKUs, reduced 7% of Frito-Lay\u2019s workforce and is shutting some plants, consolidating distribution and using AI to simplify operations. These steps are lowering costs and improving efficiency, helping PepsiCo offset higher ingredient and tariff expenses that recently caused a three-point margin drag. With more cuts ahead, including another 15% SKU reduction in the fourth quarter, the company sees a clearer path to strengthening margins across its beverage and snack businesses.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, PepsiCo is leaning heavily on a stronger pipeline of new products, from functional drinks to clean-label snacks, to drive higher-value growth. The momentum of Pepsi Zero Sugar, the fast rise of poppi and launches like Pepsi Prebiotic and Gatorade Lower Sugar show the company\u2019s shift toward more permissible, health-focused categories. PepsiCo believes that pairing strict cost savings with this innovation push can reignite growth, especially in North America, where PBNA is aiming for a mid-teens operating margin. Whether these efforts can fully restore margins will determine the strength of its 2025 rebound.\n\nAre KO & KDP Turning Cost Cuts Into Fuel for Innovation?\n\nBoth The Coca-Cola Company KO and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP are using cost-cutting efforts to create financial flexibility, allowing them to reinvest in innovation and strengthen their growth pipelines.\r\n\r\nFor Coca-Cola, disciplined cost control is helping fuel a more innovation-driven portfolio refresh. KO has already delivered strong margin expansion, and its savings from supply-chain efficiencies, smarter marketing allocation and productivity programs are giving it room to invest in new categories and premium offerings. Coca-Cola is channeling these funds into zero-sugar growth, expanded flavor innovation and functional beverages, while continuing to modernize legacy brands. With operating margin rising sharply in the latest quarter, KO is proving that cost discipline can directly support innovation and drive both profitability and long-term growth.\r\n\r\nKeurig is also relying on cost savings to support innovation-led growth, especially as margins remain pressured by lingering inflation. The company is benefiting from productivity initiatives that helped expand gross profit, even as input costs weighed on margins. These savings allow KDP to invest in new product platforms across beverages and coffee, strengthen its brewing ecosystem and enhance brand marketing. By redirecting efficiencies into innovation rather than just defending margins, KDP aims to sustain growth in key categories such as cold beverages, coffee pods and functional drinks, positioning the company for a more balanced rebound ahead.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPEP\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\n\nShares of PepsiCo have lost 2.5% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 0.2%.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, PEP trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.49X, slightly below the industry\u2019s average of 18.01X.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP\u2019s 2025 earnings implies a year-over-year decline of 0.7%, whereas its 2026 earnings estimate indicates year-over-year growth of 5.9%.

A capital-light model enables the business to generate stable earnings growth. It pays predictable dividends and looks more reasonably valued than the S&P 500. 10 stocks we like better than Coca-Cola \u203a\n\nIt might seem like a risky time to buy new stocks. The S&P 500 index\u00a0is hovering near its record highs and looks expensive at 30 times earnings, and high Treasury yields, unpredictable tariffs, trade wars, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds could compress those valuations.\n\nBut if I could only buy one stock in this frothy market, I'd stick with Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). This blue chip stalwart is also trading near its all-time high, but it's still a great buy for four simple reasons.\n\n1. A recession-resistant business model\n\nCoca-Cola might seem like a wobbly investment because soda consumption rates are declining worldwide. But over the past few decades, it diversified its portfolio with more brands of bottled water, fruit juices, teas, sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee, and even alcoholic beverages to curb its dependence on sugary sodas. It also refreshed its flagship sodas with new flavors, healthier versions, and smaller serving sizes to attract younger consumers.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCoca-Cola only sells the concentrates and syrups for those drinks, while its independent bottling partners produce and sell the finished beverages. That capital-light model enables Coca-Cola to maintain high gross margins, generate stable earnings growth, and quickly scale up its business across its higher-growth countries. It also allows the company to focus more on marketing its drinks and strengthening its key relationships with retailers and restaurants.\n\nThat evergreen business model is designed to withstand tough economic downturns. From 2004 to 2024, its earnings per share (EPS) rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% on a split-adjusted basis -- even as the Great Recession, the pandemic, and other headwinds rattled the markets. That makes it a good stock to buy, hold, and forget.\n\n2. Predictable dividend hikes\n\nCoca-Cola's stable earnings growth has enabled it to raise its dividends annually for 63 consecutive years. That makes it a Dividend King -- the elite title given to publicly traded companies in the U.S. that have raised their payouts for at least 50 straight years.\n\nThe company's trailing payout ratio of 67% indicates that it spent just over two-thirds of its EPS on its dividend payments over the past 12 months. Analysts expect its EPS to rise 23% to $3.02 this year and easily cover its forward dividend rate of $2.04, so it should keep raising its dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Its yield will attract more income-oriented investors\n\nCoca-Cola's forward yield of 2.9% might not seem too impressive right now, especially when the 10-Year Treasury yield is hovering at about 4.1%. Those yields remain stubbornly high even after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rates five times in 2024 and 2025, mainly because those rate cuts were already priced in before the actual announcements. Expectations for sticky inflation and the issuance of even more government debt to cover fiscal deficits are exacerbating that pressure.\n\nBut over the next few years, those Treasury yields should decline as that pressure eases. When that happens, the 10-Year Treasury should generate a lower yield than Coca-Cola again, and more income-seeking investors should rotate back toward the soda maker's higher-yielding stock.\n\n4. It looks more reasonably valued than the S&P 500\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Coca-Cola's EPS to grow at a CAGR of 8.7% as it launches new products, sells more premium brands (like Topo Chico) in its developed markets, and expands more aggressively in its higher-growth emerging markets. It also plans to use AI to optimize its product development, testing, and marketing capabilities.\n\nCoca-Cola stock trades at 24 times its trailing earnings and 22 times its forward earnings. It isn't a screaming bargain, but it still looks more reasonably valued than the S&P 500. That's why it should continue to attract more investors as a safe haven play -- and why it's one of the only stocks I'd recommend buying right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

MNST.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nBuilding the scenario for the Zacks Bull of the Day, broader valuation concerns have stemmed from the tech sector, with the market also on edge about delayed inflation data due to what was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the market\u2019s ability and willingness to sift out and reward economic processes has been temporarily delayed with fears of an AI bubble adding to the willingness connotation.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, how about buying a medical stock that is already seeing strong momentum but is still cheaply valued?\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This could provide a defensive hedge against any further economic uncertainty, while and when inflation data gets sorted out, especially if it's unfavorable, along with addressing the \u201ccorrection\u201d the market appears to be asking for by pivoting to a value stock.\n\nCollegium Pharmaceutical fits this strategic selection as an attractively valued Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock with the essential operations that investors often seek during market volatility, and the potentially lucrative profitability that successful biopharmaceutical companies can earn, i.e., momentum.\n\nAbout Collegium and its Recent Stock Performance\n\nDeveloping prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, Collegium is focused on pain management drugs that have an abuse-deterrent formulation, with its treatments also spanning to respiratory and skin-related disorders.\n\nAttributing to its improved margins and profitability, Collegium benefits from high-value branded drugs that are protected by patents or exclusivity periods. These include pain drug brands such as Belbuca and Nucynta, along with Xtampza ER (extended-release oxycodone), which has an exclusivity period through 2029.\n\nCollegium stock has ascended to new multi-year highs upon exceeding earnings expectations in each of its last four quarterly reports. COLL is currently trading near multi-year highs of around $45 a share and is up nearly +60% year to date.\n\nCollegium\u2019s Impressive Net Income Margins\n\nMagnifying Collegium\u2019s earnings potential has been its impressive net income margins. As shown below, Collegium has maintained a net margin of around 8.56% in the last five years (Median), with an eye-catching high of 32.73%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn comparison, Collegium\u2019s Zacks Medical-Drugs Industry\u2019s median net income average is at 4.53% during this period, and is only at 1.1% at the moment. To that point, most biopharmaceutical companies generate high-product-level profitability (gross margins) but spend heavily on operating costs, especially as it relates to R&D.\n\nWhy COLL Still Looks Cheap\n\nDespite a sharp YTD rally, Collegium stock still trades at just 6X forward earnings, offering a sharp discount to the benchmark S&P 500 and its Zacks industry average of 18X.\n\nEven better, EPS revisions are nicely up since Collegium exceeded Q3 expectations earlier in the month and raised its full-year revenue guidance.\n\nIn the last 30 days, FY25 EPS revisions have gone from $7.08 to $7.55. Furthermore, this would reflect 17% growth from EPS of $6.45 last year. And although FY27 EPS is projected to dip to $7.40, estimates are up from $6.88 per share a month ago.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCollegium is taking advantage of what has been respectable and steady sales growth, which correlates with a constant demand for health products and services. Recent market jitters suggest the smart money could start to favor such medical stocks as a defensive hedge amid valuation concerns and data setbacks that have shifted the Fed\u2019s easing cycle into a holding pattern.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nSemiconductor-related stocks have taken the brunt of the pullback in correlation with AI bubble fears, and Entegris has been one to avoid in particular.\n\nProviding materials management solutions for microelectronic and semiconductor producers, the valuation for ENTG has become more reasonable, but the trend of declining earnings estimate revisions suggests more downside risk as Entegris deals with industry-related headwinds that are specific to its operations.\n\nCorrelating with such, Entegris stock has dropped 20% this month and currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.\n\nEntegris\u2019 Cautious Outlook\n\nThe extended selloff in ENTG comes as Entegris issued somewhat weak revenue guidance for Q4 that came short of analyst expectations and suggests up to a 5% sequential decrease from the $807.1 million the company brought in last quarter.\n\nAlthough Q4 revenue targets still call for double-digit growth from a year ago, Entegris has grappled with margin compression due to tariffs and weaker U.S. sales to China.\n\nCoreWeave\u2019s Data Center Delay\n\nAdding to geopolitical trade tensions that are impacting Entegris\u2019 outlook is that industry-wide pressures have mounted after AI cloud provider CoreWeave recently announced a data center delay that triggered concerns across the semiconductor supply chain.\n\nAs a materials provider, Entegris has been caught in the downturn along with other companies in the semiconductor ecosystem, such as Arm Holdings, Micron Technology and Lam Research.\n\nDeclining EPS Revisions\n\nUnfortunately, the short-term volatility in Entegris stock is likely to persist as fiscal 2025 and FY26 EPS estimates have dropped 3% and 8% in the last 30 days, respectively.\n\nOn top of this, its top and bottom line growth prospects aren\u2019t as spectacular in terms of the expansion potential for the broader AI trade.\r\n\r\nBottom Line\n\nWith its stock falling 35% from a 52-week high of $112 a share, the short-term headwinds that Entegris may continue to face are unfortunately a reason why some AI bubble fears are realistic, especially for companies that aren\u2019t direct developers of the technology.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nCan Coca-Cola's \"All Weather\" Strategy Keep Earnings Bubbling?\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d strategy is designed to keep its earnings growing steadily, irrespective of economic cycles, weather patterns or shifting consumer trends. This strategy focuses on reducing volatility in demand, strengthening pricing power and deepening global reach.\n\nKO\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d strategy is a multifaceted approach aimed at sustaining steady beverage consumption in a year, reducing its reliance on seasonal demand patterns. The strategy also covers how KO manages its supply chain, using several sources for key ingredients, and how it operates day-to-day, using tools like trade discounts to steady demand and keep distributors involved.\n\nBy balancing its portfolio across geographies and segments, the company positions itself to perform consistently and deliver growth even in the shifting market conditions. Its highly diversified portfolio, including low-sugar options, sparkling waters, premium beverages, and functional drinks, significantly expands its presence beyond the traditional soda category.\n\nCoca-Cola has shifted to a lighter, more efficient operating setup by refranchising its bottling operations, driving efficiency gains and strengthening free cash flow. This provides greater capacity to invest in marketing, product innovation and sustainability initiatives without compromising shareholder returns. In fact, KO\u2019s global franchise system remains a key competitive advantage.\n\nCurrently, the company is executing its \u201call-weather\u201d strategy to navigate the complex operating backdrop. At its core, Coca-Cola\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d strategy helps it offset the impact of unseasonal weather and rising inflation, volatile trade conditions and an evolving geopolitical backdrop. As a result, this positions the company to deliver sustained growth and stronger earnings ahead.\n\nKO\u2019s Competition: PEP & MNST in Focus\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Monster Beverage Corp. are the beverage companies competing with Coca-Cola.\n\nPepsiCo continues to emphasize value leadership by offering a sturdy balance of affordability, innovation and brand equity across its beverage and snacks portfolio. PEP leverages broad distribution strength across traditional retail, convenience, e-commerce and foodservice to deliver strong value visibility at multiple price points. PepsiCo\u2019s focus on productivity and digital transformation remains a cornerstone of its long-term strategy to enhance efficiency, fund innovation and support margin expansion.\n\nMonster Beverage leads the market by delivering strong consumer value and maintaining share in key price segments. Monster Beverage continues to uphold its value leadership in the global energy drinks category, supported by sustained brand equity, strategic innovation and disciplined pricing. The company\u2019s balanced approach to product mix and promotional investments has helped it defend market share and deliver consistent growth, even amid competitive and inflationary pressures. MNST continues to review opportunities for higher prices, domestically and internationally.\n\nKO\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nShares of Coca-Cola have gained 13.8% year to date compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 6.5%.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, KO trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.15X compared with the industry\u2019s average of 17.87X.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for KO\u2019s 2025 and 2026 earnings per share (EPS) implies year-over-year growth of 3.5% and 8%, respectively. The estimates for 2025 and 2026 have increased a penny in the past 30 days.\n\nCoca-Cola stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If so, you're not alone. Plenty of people are confused by the mixed messages stocks are currently delivering.\n\nThere is a solution. That is, limit your options to names that are apt to perform well regardless of the economic or market environment.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) fits this bill nicely right now for four reasons, two of which aren't even specific to the company's business, but are instead linked to the bigger backdrop.\n\n1. Its brands are household names\n\nYou know the company. Coca-Cola is of course the planet's best-selling cola. The name has been so popular for so long, in fact, that it's been woven into the fabric of the global culture. Indeed, branding consultancy Interbrand says Coca-Cola is 2024's seventh-best global brand, right behind Toyota and right in front of Mercedes. That's a big deal simply because so many consumers now buy the product out of habit without really worrying about price.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company isn't just its namesake cola, though. Gold Peak tea, Powerade sports drink, Minute Maid juices, Schweppes ginger ale, Dasani water, and several other beverages are all part of the Coca-Cola family, and the company's worked similar marketing magic for all of them. These are all also household names, making them the go-to option out of habit even when most households are pinching pennies.\n\n2. The Coca-Cola Company is still a dividend hero\n\nCoca-Cola stock offers investors something far more specific, however, that matters all the time -- and especially matters in uncertain environments. That's a reliable dividend.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSure, its forward-looking yield isn't enormous at 2.8%. The percentage yield itself isn't the only detail to consider, though. Dividend growth is also important, in terms of size and frequency.\n\nCoca-Cola is solid by both standards. February's 5.2% year-over-year improvement in its quarterly per-share payout marks the 63rd consecutive year Coca-Cola's dividend payment has been raised. There's no end in sight to the streak either, as this company can consistently afford to pay its dividend from its earnings.\n\n3. In this market environment, reliability is a priority\n\nNow's also the right time to plow into Coca-Cola stock simply because you need a little additional safety at this point in time, and Coca-Cola provides it. Other investors are even willing to pay a bit of a premium to get it -- as they should, in light of how well-shielded this company is from tariff-prompted headwinds.\n\nSee, unlike many American companies, this one doesn't make much of its own products. It punts this work to third-party bottling partners who handle these duties so it can focus on what it does best. That's marketing and branding. Its network of bottlers also does this work in (or at least near) the countries where these goods will ultimately be consumed, so there's actually very little cross-border shipping going on to tax or tariff. The company's biggest border-related headache is simply repatriating profits generated overseas -- not exactly the worst of problems to have.\n\n4. This may be all the discount you're going to get\n\nFinally, while this stock defied the odds back in February by rallying when most everything else was sinking, it's not made any actual forward progress since then, suspiciously stopping right around August's record high of $72.57. This suggests investors may fear Coca-Cola shares are bumping into a psychological ceiling even if they deserve to be priced higher.\n\nTake a step back and look at the longer-term trend, though. This ticker's been making reliable forward (even if a bit erratic) progress for well over a decade now, shrugging off a wide range of potential stumbling blocks. Yet it's still well below analysts' consensus price target of $79.50, the majority of whom still rate Coca-Cola stock as a strong buy.\n\nThe point is, even if the average amateur investor doesn't see it right now, the professional stock-pickers largely all agree that this ticker's stagnation since March doesn't make sense. The crowd may start to agree sooner than later, rekindling this stock's bigger-picture rally as a result.\n\nAlways good, but even better right now\n\nThis isn't the only worthy name to buy right now, of course, nor is right now the only good time to buy this one -- Coca-Cola is a perennial winner even if it's not a high-growth stock. You could always do worse.\n\nBut if you're looking for a smart forever holding to buy that will help your portfolio weather the looming unknown we're currently facing, this simple but reliable choice is a great one for almost any investor. Don't overthink it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company continues to grow revenue and profitability. Coca-Cola's valuation has become more compelling. 10 stocks we like better than Coca-Cola \u203a\n\nIf you're a stock investor looking at the long term, you know there's no use in timing the market. After all, it's a futile exercise, since it's virtually impossible to predict what short-term factors may affect stock prices.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that compelling long-term opportunities don't present themselves. Blue chip companyCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is one such stock.\n\nIt may surprise some investors that this venerable company still offers an attractive opportunity for those looking to hold the stock for a long period. It's time to learn more about Coca-Cola and lay out the reasons that patient investors should purchase the shares.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Growing dividends\n\nCoca-Cola should appeal to those seeking dividend-paying stocks. The stock does not just have a long history of payments, but an impressive record of regular increases.\n\nEarlier this year, the board of directors raised the quarterly payout by more than 5% to $0.51. The latest increase marked 63 consecutive years that shareholders have seen a higher payment. That makes Coca-Cola a Dividend King.\n\nClearly, the company prioritizes dividends in its capital allocation. With a payout ratio of about 67%, Coca-Cola can afford the payments, too.\n\nThe stock has a much higher dividend yield than the overall market, as measured by the S&P 500 index. Coca-Cola's stock yields 2.9%, versus 1.2% for the S&P 500.\n\n2. Steady revenue growth\n\nCoca-Cola first started selling drinks in 1886, and now sells beverages in more than 200 countries. These include soda, water, plant-based beverages, juice, and value-added dairy.\n\nThe company's days of rapid expansion and fast revenue growth seem likely to be behind it. But Coca-Cola has produced steady top-line growth.\n\nThird-quarter revenue, adjusted to remove foreign-currency translations and acquisitions/divestitures, grew 6% compared to a year ago. The increase came solely from higher prices/changing mix. Meanwhile, volume was flat.\n\nIdeally, some of the company's revenue growth should come from higher volume. However, I'm not concerned, since it's a challenging period for consumers dealing with economic uncertainties and higher prices.\n\nAt some point, inflation will abate, and I expect volume will pick up. In the meantime, Coca-Cola's beverages continue to gain market share.\n\n3. Profit growth\n\nCoca-Cola's not merely growing its share of the market at the expense of its margin and profitability. That's obviously important, since a company's profit ultimately correlates with stock price performance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn an adjusted basis, Coca-Cola's operating margin expanded 1.2 percentage points to 31.9%. This came about despite an increase in marketing spending.\n\nWith higher sales and an expanded margin, the company had an impressive 15% increase in operating income.\n\n4. Total return potential\n\nCoca-Cola's stock price has gained 14.3% this year through Nov. 14. That's essentially in line with the S&P 500's 14.5% appreciation.\n\nHowever, Coca-Cola's shares now trade at a more attractive valuation, based on the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The stock has a P/E multiple of 24, compared to 25 at the start of the year, and it reached 28 earlier this year. The current P/E ratio is also lower than the 10-year median of 28.\n\nCoca-Cola's stock also has a better relative valuation than the S&P 500. The index has a P/E ratio of 30.\n\nA higher relative dividend yield combined with an attractive valuation makes a powerful combination. It means investors can sit back and confidently collect dividends, while patiently waiting for the stock price to increase over time due to profit growth and multiple expansion.\n\nThat creates a compelling total return opportunity.\n\nShould you buy stock in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

As a consumer staples company, its products are bought regularly in good times and bad. The company is a Dividend King. 10 stocks we like better than Coca-Cola \u203a\n\nThe question isn't if a bear market will happen; the question is when the next bear market will arrive. Given the lofty levels of the S&P 500, it is reasonable for investors to suspect the answer is sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you are concerned, consider investing in Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO).\n\nHere are three reasons this consumer staples company could be a good addition to your portfolio today.\n\n1. Coca-Cola operates in an attractive sector\n\nBefore digging into Coca-Cola's business, it is notable that it falls within the consumer staples sector.\n\nConsumer staples are products that are purchased regularly and typically have relatively low costs associated with them. Think products like deodorant, toilet paper, food, and beverages. You aren't about to stop buying any of these things regardless of the economy or the stock market.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThere is a risk of trade-down with consumer staples products. For example, Coca-Cola's beverages tend to be at the high end of the sector. That makes them premium products.\n\nConsumers could save money by buying store-brand soda instead of a Coke. However, another key feature of consumer staples is that they tend to have material brand loyalty. People tend to like the products they buy, and so they continue to buy them regardless of what's going on in the world.\n\nIn the case of Coca-Cola, the company's products end up being an affordable luxury. Sure, trading down could save money, but probably not enough to offset the enjoyment derived from drinking a Coke. So at a basic level, the business is resilient to recessions and bear markets.\n\n2. Coca-Cola is a very well-run business\n\nCoca-Cola isn't just another player in the beverage sector. It is the world's single most important nonalcoholic beverage company. With a market cap of $300 billion, it ranks as the fourth largest consumer staples business in the world despite only making one basic product.\n\nThe company has impressive distribution, marketing, and innovation skills that rival those of any consumer staples peer. It is also large enough to act as an industry consolidator, acquiring small but growing brands to complement its already impressive roster of iconic brands. It's one of the best-run companies in the world based on its impressive history.\n\nThe proof is it status as a Dividend King, with more than six decades of annual dividend increases. A company can't build a track record like that by accident; it requires a strong business model that is executed well in good times and bad.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe last six decades have included numerous bear markets and recessions. Coca-Cola has survived every one of them.\n\n3. Its stock is reasonably priced\n\nThe last reason to buy Coca-Cola right now is its valuation. The stock's price-to-sales ratio is slightly above its five-year average. But the price-to-earnings, price-to-book-value, price-to-cash-flow, and price-to-forward-earnings ratios are all below their five-year averages.\n\nCoca-Cola is not a value stock; it is best seen as fairly priced to a little cheap. However, it's a high-quality company that could be a strong entry point for more-conservative investors. Add in the roughly 2.9% dividend yield, and the story gets even better. If there's a bear market, you can focus on the reliable dividend income you are generating instead of the price of the stock.

As a consumer staples company, its products are bought regularly in good times and bad. The company is a Dividend King.10 stocks we like better than Coca-Cola \u203a\n\nThe question isn't if a bear market will happen; the question is when the next bear market will arrive. Given the lofty levels of the S&P 500, it is reasonable for investors to suspect the answer is sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you are concerned, consider investing in Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO).\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nHere are three reasons this consumer staples company could be a good addition to your portfolio today.\n\n1. Coca-Cola operates in an attractive sector\n\nBefore digging into Coca-Cola's business, it is notable that it falls within the consumer staples sector.\n\nConsumer staples are products that are purchased regularly and typically have relatively low costs associated with them. Think products like deodorant, toilet paper, food, and beverages. You aren't about to stop buying any of these things regardless of the economy or the stock market.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThere is a risk of trade-down with consumer staples products. For example, Coca-Cola's beverages tend to be at the high end of the sector. That makes them premium products.\n\nConsumers could save money by buying store-brand soda instead of a Coke. However, another key feature of consumer staples is that they tend to have material brand loyalty. People tend to like the products they buy, and so they continue to buy them regardless of what's going on in the world.\n\nIn the case of Coca-Cola, the company's products end up being an affordable luxury. Sure, trading down could save money, but probably not enough to offset the enjoyment derived from drinking a Coke. So at a basic level, the business is resilient to recessions and bear markets.\n\n2. Coca-Cola is a very well-run business\n\nCoca-Cola isn't just another player in the beverage sector. It is the world's single most important nonalcoholic beverage company. With a market cap of $300 billion, it ranks as the fourth largest consumer staples business in the world despite only making one basic product.\n\nThe company has impressive distribution, marketing, and innovation skills that rival those of any consumer staples peer. It is also large enough to act as an industry consolidator, acquiring small but growing brands to complement its already impressive roster of iconic brands. It's one of the best-run companies in the world based on its impressive history.\n\nThe proof is it status as a Dividend King, with more than six decades of annual dividend increases. A company can't build a track record like that by accident; it requires a strong business model that is executed well in good times and bad.\n\nThe last six decades have included numerous bear markets and recessions. Coca-Cola has survived every one of them.\n\n3. Its stock is reasonably priced\n\nThe last reason to buy Coca-Cola right now is its valuation. The stock's price-to-sales ratio is slightly above its five-year average. But the price-to-earnings, price-to-book-value, price-to-cash-flow, and price-to-forward-earnings ratios are all below their five-year averages.\n\nCoca-Cola is not a value stock; it is best seen as fairly priced to a little cheap. However, it's a high-quality company that could be a strong entry point for more-conservative investors. Add in the roughly 2.9% dividend yield, and the story gets even better. If there's a bear market, you can focus on the reliable dividend income you are generating instead of the price of the stock. That should make sitting still through a downturn much easier.\n\nCoca-Cola is a resilient business and investment\n\nThere's no way for investors to completely avoid bear markets; they will always be a part of the stock market. Preparing for the inevitable is really all you can do. Right now, buying a company in a resilient sector, with a strong business, and a valuation that's reasonable to attractive could be the right move if you are worried that a bear market is on the way.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

An interesting development is that despite Costa Coffee's challenges, market enthusiasm has grown due to Coca-Cola's reputation as a Dividend King, positive analyst sentiment, and recognition from influential commentators for its high-quality dividend profile and broad beverage portfolio.

The recent pause on a Costa sale highlights management\u2019s willingness to address underperformance, but in the near term, the company\u2019s core earnings drivers, from flagship sodas to fast-growing categories, remain largely unaffected, with competitive and regulatory risks still the most critical factors to monitor.\n\nAmong recent announcements, Coca-Cola\u2019s reaffirmation of its full-year outlook for organic revenue and earnings growth stands out, suggesting confidence in broader operations despite Costa\u2019s headwinds. This stability, paired with continued share buybacks and regular dividends, appears to support the key catalysts for shareholder value.\n\nHowever, amid these solid fundamentals, investors should not overlook the contrasting threat that regulatory action or changing health trends could pose to Coca-Cola's...\n\nRead the full narrative on Coca-Cola (it's free!)\n\nCoca-Cola's outlook anticipates $55.1 billion in revenue and $14.8 billion in earnings by 2028.

It\u2019s going to be tough to dethrone Amazon as the leader of a couple of different growth markets. Interest in electric vehicles may be tepid within the United States, but that\u2019s certainly not the case everywhere else. 10 stocks we like better than PepsiCo \u203a\n\nPlenty of companies tout their long-term growth prospects, and many investors believe them.\n\nThe fact is, however, most companies won't quite meet these lofty long-term expectations. It takes something special for a company to thrive for decades on end -- or even in perpetuity -- and reward shareholders for their patience.\n\nThese names are out there though, with some of them hiding in plain sight. Here's a look at three such stocks that could create lasting generational wealth. Or, they could at least dish out enough multiyear gains in the meantime to leave a nice lump sum to your grandchildren.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. PepsiCo\n\nWhen given the choice of beverage stocks to buy, most investors tend to choose Coca-Cola over PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). And understandably so. Not only is Coke the bigger of the two, it's also a more familiar household name.\n\nIf you're going to choose one or the other right now, PepsiCo stock is arguably the better choice here for a couple of reasons.\n\nOne of these reasons is very basic. That is, PepsiCo's dividend is higher, with a forward-looking dividend yield of 3.9% versus Coke's 2.9%. Although there's always more to a dividend stock than its yield (like longevity, or its historical growth), these two stocks' dividend pedigrees are similar enough to still make PepsiCo's bigger yield the smarter overall choice at this time.\n\nCoca-Cola has raised its per-share dividend payment every year for the past 63 years, for instance, but PepsiCo is no slouch with 53 consecutive annual increases of its payout.\n\nAs for the other big reason pick PepsiCo over Coke here, while it's not readily evident from a consumer's point of view, the two beverage companies are operationally quite different.\n\nNot only does PepsiCo own the Frito-Lay family of snack chips as well as Quaker Oats, but PepsiCo owns (or at least controls) most of its bottling and production facilities, whereas Coca-Cola punts the majority of its bottling work to contracted third-party bottlers so it can focus on what it does best. That's marketing. It's been a high-margin business model that's worked well for Coca-Cola for years now, too.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith artificial intelligence (AI) leveling the playing field for beverage companies of all sizes though (at the same time consumers are increasingly willing to try less-established and less-obvious brands), PepsiCo's more complete control of its entire -- and more diversified -- business could prove to be a strategic advantage.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nThere's no denying Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) highest-growth days are in the rearview mirror. After all, when you're already realizing more than $600 billion worth of revenue per year, it's logistically difficult to find more customers, or find more ways to generate more sales from existing customers.\n\nStill, last quarter's top line growth of 13% is pretty impressive for a $2.5 trillion behemoth. And it's this sheer size that makes Amazon such a compelling long-term growth prospect.\n\nWhile it's not outright impossible, dethroning a market leader is pretty difficult to do. An industry's leading name usually becomes its biggest name for good reason, after all, one of which is a fierce focus on the customer experience that Amazon's current CEO Andy Jassy still obsesses over. It's also difficult to displace a market leader when that market leader makes a point of being paranoid about its competition, which Amazon does.\n\nIn other words, Amazon isn't about to be displaced as North America's leading e-commerce outfit, or the planet's leading cloud computing service provider.\n\nNeither business is apt to run into any real headwinds anytime soon either. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that -- despite e-commerce's growth over the course of the past 25 years -- still less than one-fifth of this country's retail spending is done online. Meanwhile, the AI boom is not only creating demand for more remote (cloud-based) computing solutions, but also driving the need for more storage of all the digital data now being created by artificial intelligence. And, there's no end in sight to this dynamic.\n\n3. BYD Company\n\nFinally, add BYD Company(OTC: BYDDY) to your list of stocks that could create lasting generational wealth.\n\nIf you're not familiar with it, BYD is the company that recently displaced Tesla as the world's biggest manufacturer of electric vehicles, as measured by revenue as well as unit sales. It's just not a household name here in America because BYD doesn't sell cars here. Its primary market is China, although it's making surprising inroads in Europe too.\n\nNo place is out of reach in the long run, however. BYD has taken the unusual-but-savvy step of acquiring six massive transport ships (with a seventh on the way), each capable of carrying a few thousand EVs anywhere accessible by ocean.\n\nIt's difficult not to notice this stock's underperformed since the middle of this year. Blame its competitors, mostly, which are putting pressure on its profit margins in an economic environment that isn't exactly robust, particularly in BYD's core market of China.\n\nThis is also apt to be temporary weakness though, turning this ticker's 35% pullback from its June peak into an opportunity rather than a warning. Electric vehicles are still the future, particularly in China, where EY (you may know as Ernst & Young) expects more than 90% of all vehicle sales to be battery-powered automobiles by 2034, up from around 50% this year. The rest of the world shouldn't be too far behind that pace.\n\nThe kicker: BYD is working on solid state lithium batteries that should get electric vehicles over the adoption hump, so to speak. While commercial production is still at least a couple years down the road, this new kind of EV battery charges faster, lasts longer, is safer, and perhaps most importantly, adds meaningfully more driving range to current lithium-based EV batteries.\n\nPlenty of other automobile manufacturers are working on electric vehicles. All of them are going to struggle to catch up with BYD. It's just too far along, and is likely to end up becoming the dominant name in the business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

The strategy also covers how KO manages its supply chain, using several sources for key ingredients, and how it operates day-to-day, using tools like trade discounts to steady demand and keep distributors involved.\r\n\r\nBy balancing its portfolio across geographies and segments, the company positions itself to perform consistently and deliver growth even in the shifting market conditions. Its highly diversified portfolio, including low-sugar options, sparkling waters, premium beverages, and functional drinks, significantly expands its presence beyond the traditional soda category.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola has shifted to a lighter, more efficient operating setup by refranchising its bottling operations, driving efficiency gains and strengthening free cash flow. This provides greater capacity to invest in marketing, product innovation and sustainability initiatives without compromising shareholder returns.

At its core, Coca-Cola\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d strategy helps it offset the impact of unseasonal weather and rising inflation, volatile trade conditions and an evolving geopolitical backdrop. As a result, this positions the company to deliver sustained growth and stronger earnings ahead.\n\nKO\u2019s Competition: PEP & MNST in Focus\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. PEP and Monster Beverage Corporation MNST are the beverage companies competing with Coca-Cola.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo continues to emphasize value leadership by offering a sturdy balance of affordability, innovation and brand equity across its beverage and snacks portfolio. PEP leverages broad distribution strength across traditional retail, convenience, e-commerce and foodservice to deliver strong value visibility at multiple price points. PepsiCo\u2019s focus on productivity and digital transformation remains a cornerstone of its long-term strategy to enhance efficiency, fund innovation and support margin expansion.\r\n\r\nMonster Beverage leads the market by delivering strong consumer value and maintaining share in key price segments. Monster Beverage continues to uphold its value leadership in the global energy drinks category, supported by sustained brand equity, strategic innovation and disciplined pricing. The company\u2019s balanced approach to product mix and promotional investments has helped it defend market share and deliver consistent growth, even amid competitive and inflationary pressures.

It's happening across the brokerage firms right now, and it's happening in size. Advisors are locking in losses to offset the big realized gains from earlier in the year, especially back in April when clients trimmed their winners and booked profits. We know from trading partners across the Street that most of the sell orders for stocks with year-to-date losses are coming in as market orders, which we interpret as tax loss sellers just looking to get out \u2013 if only for 31 days as the IRS dictates. Between now and year-end, these heavy flows are likely to continue. Portfolios are being repositioned, stocks are being rotated out for the 31-day wash-sale rule, and you're getting a lot of tax-selling. Some good companies are getting thrown out just because they're sitting in the red \u2014 not because anything's necessarily broken from a fundamental perspective. To be clear, I'm not a fan of buying losers. A 52-week low is not a buy signal \u2014 most names hit new lows for a reason. But this year might present some opportunities because there's a lot of technical and tax-driven distortion out there. We had a strong start to 2025, a narrow leadership group \u2013 led by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" and now we're seeing potential dumpster-diving opportunities \u2014 temporary dislocations in quality names. Think about what's showing up on the radar right now: the \"Dogs of the Dow\" for 2025 \u2014 your highest-yielding blue chips \u2014 include names like Verizon , Chevron , Amgen , Johnson & Johnson , Coca-Cola and IBM (we own most of these companies). These aren't speculative trades. They're global franchises yielding between 3% and nearly 7%. VZ CVX YTD mountain VZ and CVX year to date And then, if you look beyond the 'Dogs' \u2014 some of tickers on the 52-week-low list you could find decent companies that might be having an off year. You've got Procter & Gamble , which is actually both a Dog of the Dow and a new-low name; Adobe , ADP , Kimberly-Clark , Kraft Heinz , and Charter Communications \u2014 all making fresh lows. Historically, these haven't been super high-risk tickers \u2014 these are established companies. This exercise shouldn't be about trash picking \u2014 it's about sifting through temporary weakness for quality that's been unfairly sold. If you can find a name with a solid balance sheet, strong free cash flow, and a dividend that pays you to wait, it may be worth a look while everyone else is selling it for tax reasons. And that brings me to one of those names I'm actually buying: IBM . IBM YTD bar IBM in 2025 IBM is a current Dog of the Dow yielding just over 2%, and I think it's quietly turning into one of the more interesting opportunities in large-cap tech. The market still treats IBM like an old-school mainframe company, but that's outdated. Nearly half their revenue now comes from software, hybrid cloud, and AI services. In the last quarter, software revenue was up almost 9% and free cash flow came in around $13.5 billion. At roughly 25 times forward earnings, you're getting a high-yielding, cash-rich, AI-levered enterprise name at a discount \u2014 and that's not something you can say about most of mega-cap tech right now. The z17 mainframe refresh is ramping up, Red Hat continues to deliver, and enterprise AI adoption is just starting to flow through. If anything, the year-end weakness we've seen looks like an opportunity. \"Harvesting\" this year doesn't mean chasing broken stories.

There was also growth (18%) from existing buyers expanding their brand and category purchases, while only a third of total growth came from competitive steal.\n\nBrands with a high Brand Traction Score tend to be larger, faster-growing, and more efficient at converting visibility into sales. With NIQ\u2019s Brand Traction Score, FMCG manufacturers can break down the drivers of brand growth and identify marketing and trade optimisation opportunities.\n\nFrom indulgence to dairy: categories driving traction\n\nNIQ\u2019s analysis revealed that within Western Europe - which includes the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy \u2013 Coca-Cola is the brand with the highest traction, with a score of 4871.\n\nCoca-Cola was closely followed by cream cheese brand Philadelphia (458), with Nutella (426) taking third place. Among the top 15, indulgent brands lead, followed by dairy - both categories have benefited from broad product portfolios, versatile usage occasions and shorter purchase cycles. Apart from established international brands, we also see a representation of strong local players and category specialists within the top 15 ranking.\n\nOut of 446 European brands (49%) that managed to grow significantly in unit sales (+5% or more), 81% managed to win over both shoppers and retailers, boosting their appeal on both sides of the shelf 2. Additionally, 60% of these brands grew their brand traction, meaning that their additional listings resulted in proportionately more frequent purchases by more shoppers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe proof is in the Brand Traction pudding\n\nAcross all seven FMCG sectors analysed, the data reveals a consistent pattern: the brands achieving the strongest unit sales growth are also those seeing the greatest increases in brand traction. This underscores that while distribution remains a crucial area for growth, success ultimately depends on prioritising the right products (new or existing) that can more effectively convert shelf presence into sales.\n\nBrands that grow their Brand Traction Score the most and achieve sales growth stand out by investing in what Western European shoppers care about most during a period of economic uncertainty: everyday affordability, healthier choices and sustainable options. By expanding into adjacent categories and launching new products that meet these needs, they are successfully strengthening their presence on the shelf and at the same time expanding the consumption of their brand and their parent category in more households, more often.\n\nEmilie Darolles, President Western Europe, NIQ said: \"The Brand Traction Score is a powerful new metric that reveals how effectively brands turn shelf presence into real purchases. We\u2019ve seen brands that didn\u2019t expand their physical availability still grow sales by strengthening their brand traction, proving that growth isn\u2019t just about gaining new buyers - it\u2019s about converting them more often.\"\n\nDarolles Adds: \"In Western Europe\u2019s highly competitive market, this composite metric brings together NIQ\u2019s integrated data sources to provide the Full View\u2122, giving manufacturers a clear and actionable read on growth opportunities, and enabling brands to improve conversion, enhance in-store performance, and drive sustainable growth.\"\n\n1 Examined among 446 brands with at least 1% penetration in EU5 that grew in terms of unit sales by +5% or more in the past year ending May 2025 compared to year ago  2 This analysis combines Retail and Panel data for the year ending May 2025, providing a more robust assessment of brands performance (based on Retail sales data) as well as a more comprehensive understanding of what makes international brands grow.\n\nAbout the NIQ Brand Traction Score\n\nThe NIQ Brand Traction Score is a powerful new metric that reveals how effectively brands convert shelf presence into real consumer purchases. It blends two key NIQ data sources: insights from our Consumer Panel, which tracks how frequently shoppers buy a brand, and our Retail Measurement data, which measures how widely and deeply that brand is distributed across stores.\n\nThe Brand Traction Score reflects how many purchase occasions are generated for every individual store listing. For example, if a brand is available in 100 distribution points and records 500,000 purchase occasions, its Brand Traction Score would be 5,000, meaning each listing delivers 5,000 purchases.\n\nA higher score indicates a brand that not only reaches more consumers but also converts visibility into sales more efficiently. This makes the Brand Traction Score a valuable tool for manufacturers and retailers alike - helping them pinpoint brands with the strongest shopper pull and uncover opportunities to accelerate growth.\n\nAbout NIQ\n\nNielsenIQ (NIQ) is a leading consumer intelligence company, delivering the most complete understanding of consumer buying behaviour and revealing new pathways to growth. Our global reach spans over 90 countries covering approximately 85% of the world's population and more than $7.2 trillion in global consumer spend.

By generating consistently high profits, the business has been able to increase its dividend for decades. The combination of earnings growth and valuation changes will drive Coca-Cola shareholder returns going forward. 10 stocks we like better than Coca-Cola \u203a\n\nWith its more than 200 drink brands that can cater to any consumer taste, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is a dominant force in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink industry. Having been founded in 1886, the company today has a presence in more than 200 countries and territories. And 2.2 billion servings of its products are consumed every single day.\n\nThese stats are phenomenal, underscoring the leading position the business has. It's clear that Coca-Cola needs no introduction. But could investing $10,000 in this beverage stock make you a millionaire one day?Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHere's why Coca-Cola is an outstanding company\n\nCoca-Cola is without a doubt a high-quality business. This is something that even the great Warren Buffett believes to be true, as Berkshire Hathaway owns 400 million of the company's outstanding shares. When the Oracle of Omaha has a positive view of a company, perhaps the average investor should take a closer look.\n\nCoca-Cola's most notable characteristic is its brand name. Decades of selling beverages that consumers have built an affinity toward can support how well the brand resonates. Coca-Cola is associated with happiness, not just quenching one's thirst. The company's ability to also drive impactful marketing campaigns has helped tremendously. This is one of the world's strongest brands.\n\nThat has supported Coca-Cola's ongoing pricing power. During the latest fiscal quarter (Q3 2025 ended Sept. 26), the business benefited from a 4% jump in prices, which isn't a new trend. Because consumers are loyal to the brand, Coca-Cola can constantly ask them to pay more over time. By selling a product that lends itself to small, repeat purchases, the business gains financially.\n\nInvestors shouldn't ignore how profitable Coca-Cola is. It outsources the capital-intensive aspects of bottling and distribution to third-party partners. As a result, the business has registered a fantastic trailing-10-year operating margin of 26.4%. Coca-Cola generates plenty of free cash flow that directly benefits shareholders.\n\nIn February, the company's board of directors approved another dividend hike. This marked the 63rd straight year of increases. Very few businesses have this sort of track record.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCan Coca-Cola stock beat the market?\n\nEven though this is a wonderful business, investors should think about the stock's ability to produce impressive returns. One factor to consider is growth. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, the company's earnings per share are projected to increase at a compound annual rate of only 6.3% between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2027. That's nothing to get excited about. It's difficult to expand rapidly when you've been around for so long and your products are already ubiquitous.\n\nValuation also plays a part. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. If this multiple were much cheaper, it would obviously add more upside for interested investors.\n\nIt's evident that Coca-Cola shares don't have what it takes to produce market-beating returns over the long term. The business is very mature, with muted potential to significantly grow revenue and earnings. And the valuation doesn't exactly present a bargain opportunity. In the past decade, the stock has generated a total return of 136% (as of Nov. 14). I believe the trend of underperforming the broader S&P 500 will continue.\n\nConsequently, it's not a surprise that Coca-Cola isn't a millionaire-maker stock. In order for a $10,000 starting sum to turn into $1 million, it would require a monster 100-fold gain. There are very few stocks on Earth that can put up this kind of return. Coca-Cola is not one of them.\n\nInvestors should focus their efforts on trying to build a diversified portfolio of high-quality companies, instead of hoping a single position can make them rich. This is a promising way of handling your investments for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

That wisdom translates nicely to investing.\n\nWhile you have the freedom to follow any strategy you choose, it's often far easier to build wealth than you might guess. All you need to do is pick the right stocks, hold them for a long time, and try to leave them alone unless there is a good reason not to.\n\nWarren Buffett is famous for this idea of buying and holding fantastic stocks. But which stocks are the right ones? Companies with a history of paying and raising dividends are a great place to look. Here are three examples of what might be considered easy wealth builders.\n\nThey won't make you rich overnight, but buying and holding them can make you quite wealthy over two or three decades.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nBeverage giant Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) dates back to the late 1800s. Since then, its legendary namesake soda has been the driving force behind a company that has become a global juggernaut. Today, Coca-Cola owns approximately 200 brands of sodas, teas, coffee, juices, water, and other beverages, and sells them in more than 200 countries.\n\nCoca-Cola's global name recognition and vast distribution network have become competitive moats. Other companies can't get the shelf space and priority that Coca-Cola commands at stores and other points of sale. When an innovative new brand emerges, Coca-Cola often acquires it or launches an alternative that it can quickly grow by plugging it into countless sales locations worldwide.\n\nThe company's steady success has produced 62 consecutive annual dividend increases, and analysts anticipate Coca-Cola growing earnings at a mid- to high-single-digit annualized pace over the long term, so that streak should continue for years to come. Owning Coca-Cola stock is a proven ticket to wealth, especially if you reinvest the dividends.\n\n2. McDonald's\n\nFast-food giant McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) is central to American culture, which has helped it thrive both in the United States and abroad. Today, McDonald's has more than 44,000 locations across roughly 100 countries. The company's franchising business model generates recurring revenue from fees and royalties, making McDonald's an excellent dividend stock.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMcDonald's boasts a massive, efficient supply chain that enables it to offer fast, affordable food. That has built its value-centric reputation and made McDonald's a stalwart among consumers. While people may pull back on restaurant food when money is tight, McDonald's is likely to remain a cost leader in the industry, which could actually help it capture market share during recessions.\n\nManagement has raised the stock's dividend for 49 consecutive years. McDonald's continues to expand, with goals to grow its store count to 50,000 locations by the end of 2027. Analysts estimate that McDonald's will continue to grow its earnings at a mid- to high-single-digit annualized rate, which should continue funding dividend increases for the foreseeable future.\n\n3. Philip Morris International\n\nIt may surprise you to see leading tobacco company Philip Morris International(NYSE: PM) on this list. After all, smoking cigarettes is an increasingly uncommon habit, even if tobacco companies have managed to raise prices to offset decades of steady industrywide volume declines. Philip Morris separated from Altria Group in 2008 and sells Marlboro cigarettes in non-U.S. markets.\n\nPhilip Morris has raised its dividend annually since 2008, building on a decades-long history of increases under Altria. Philip Morris may have the brightest future of any tobacco stock due to its emerging dominance in smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes, such as heated tobacco devices and oral nicotine salt pouches. Its Iqos and Zyn brands have been wildly successful, growing to 41% of the company's total sales.\n\nPhilip Morris still has plenty of tread left on its legacy Marlboro cigarette business, which currently enjoys its highest market share since 2008 at 10.9%. That, paired with the growth in smoke-free products, has analysts calling for low-double-digit annualized earnings growth moving forward. Look for the dividend hikes to continue piling up. A starting dividend yield of 3.8% makes the stock a potential cash cow for your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes.

Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

The new policy specifically exempts coffee from the previously imposed reciprocal tariffs that were as high as 10% to 15%. The rollback was motivated by inflationary pressures and mounting criticism over rising grocery prices, with coffee prices up around 19% over the past year.\n\nThe National Coffee Association said the decision will ease cost-of-living pressures for the millions of Americans who drink coffee and provide greater security for U.S. companies that rely on imported beans. Trade deals with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Argentina were noted to have played a role in securing the tariff reduction for coffee.\n\nExperts expect the rollback to reduce input costs for coffee roasters, retailers, and related companies, although tariffs on imports from some top sources such as Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam remain unchanged for now. Some analysts indicate the price reduction will help but may not immediately affect retail-level prices due to factors such as hedging, supply contracts, and global market dynamics.\n\nCoffee futures fell 5.4% on Monday after sitting near their highest levels in more than five decades earlier in the year due to continued weather disruptions, trade tariffs, and structural supply imbalances in major producing countries. Key factors in addition to tariffs tightened global coffee supply and pushed prices for arabica and robusta coffee futures up. Extreme weather in producing regions has been a major consideration. Brazil, which supplies roughly one-third of the world\u2019s coffee, has faced severe drought and heat, cutting yields and bean sizes. Vietnam and Colombia have also struggled with erratic rainfall and dry spells.\n\nOn the tariff front, the U.S. enacted tariffs of 40% on Brazilian and 20% on Vietnamese coffee earlier this year. Those two countries account for more than half of global output, sharply reducing export flows and raising U.S. import costs broadly.\n\nCompanies potentially impacted by the level of coffee prices include Starbucks Corporation (SBUX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX]), Dutch Bros (BROS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BROS]), First Watch Restaurant Group (FWRG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FWRG]), Coffee Holding (JVA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JVA]), Dunkin' Brands, J.M.

The company operates more like a mutual fund than a traditional corporation. Berkshire Hathaway is well-prepared for the future thanks to one very important balance sheet figure. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway \u203a\n\nBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) is making headlines today because longtime Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett is handing off the reins to key lieutenant Greg Abel. This is a significant development, but it is unlikely to lead to substantial changes in the way the giant conglomerate is run. If you are looking at Berkshire Hathaway today, you should probably look past the CEO transition and focus on this one factor instead.\n\nWhat is Berkshire Hathaway?\n\nAs noted, Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate. That simply means it is a company that owns a significant number of other companies. Most conglomerates operate in a handful of different industries with a small number of various subsidiary companies. At the end of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway owned 189 different companies under its corporate umbrella. That's a huge number.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWhat's interesting about the 189 businesses, however, is that they span a huge range of different industries. Berkshire Hathaway has several large companies that it breaks out individually, including railroad, utility, and energy companies. However, it also owns companies in the retail, travel, chemicals, and manufacturing sectors. And even that's just a small sampling of what CEO Warren Buffett has created during his tenure.\n\nThe owned portfolio is just the start, too, because Berkshire Hathaway also owns a large portfolio of publicly traded stocks. Some of the biggest holdings include Chevron(NYSE: CVX), Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), and American Express(NYSE: AMX). There are many more stocks in the mix, with Buffett explaining that he largely views the company's publicly traded stocks and its privately owned businesses in much the same way.\n\nWhich brings Buffett's investment approach to the fore. He likes to buy well-run businesses when they are attractively priced and then hold them for the long term to benefit from the growth of those businesses over time. What he doesn't do is micromanage the businesses, letting the companies operate fairly autonomously. In this way, Berkshire Hathaway is more like a mutual fund than a traditional corporation. You are, effectively, investing alongside Buffett.\n\nAbel has a big leg up as he takes over\n\nAfter the start of the new year, however, you will be investing alongside Greg Abel since he will be the CEO at that point. It is a notable change, but he has been training under Buffett for decades. And Buffett will be staying on as the chairman of the board of directors, so Abel will still report to Buffett. It is unlikely that Buffett will let Abel flounder without offering some assistance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe one reason now is a great time to consider buying Berkshire Hathaway is because Abel is taking over with a huge safety net. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, the company's balance sheet had more than $380 billion in cash and equivalents on it. To put that into perspective, the median market cap of the S&P 500 index(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is about $400 billion. A median represents the middle value of a list, with half of the group above and half below that value. Berkshire Hathaway's cash hoard is shockingly large.\n\nThere are two benefits to having so much cash. First, when the next bear market arrives, Berkshire Hathaway as a business will have the cash it needs to come through the downturn in relative stride. Second, Abel will likely have sufficient cash on hand to start acquiring companies and publicly traded stocks during the bear market, as investors indiscriminately sell assets.\n\nSure, Abel will have big shoes to fill, but Buffett is leaving him with a very large gift, so he will get off to a good start. And if you have been considering adding Berkshire Hathaway to your portfolio, the company's substantial cash reserves are a compelling reason to buy the stock today.\n\nIs there ever a bad time to hire a good money manager?\n\nUltimately, the unique nature of Berkshire Hathaway alters the investment equation. You shouldn't view it as a company so much as hiring Buffett and Abel to manage money on your behalf. There's really never a bad time to hire a good money manager.\n\nThe transition to Abel is a wildcard for sure, but with Buffett still around and the enormous cash stockpile at Abel's disposal, there's no big reason to avoid adding Berkshire to your portfolio today. In fact, it could even turn out to be a great time to buy the stock, especially if you are concerned about the odds of an impending bear market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, recent strong performance raises the question: is there still a buying opportunity here, or is all future growth already reflected in the price?\n\nMost Popular Narrative: 5% Overvalued\n\nAccording to AllTrades, Coca-Cola\u2019s current share price of $71.16 stands slightly above the narrative\u2019s estimated fair value of $67.50. This latest perspective is powered by projections that paint Coca-Cola as a unique income compounder with a resilient premium.\n\n\u2022 Business: KO remains firmly entrenched in its core beverage moat, with growth in premium categories such as Zero Sugar, energy drinks, and functional waters. \r\n\r\n \u2022 Financials: Revenue growth of approximately 4 to 5% CAGR, operating margins of 28 to 30%, and FCF of about $15 to $17 billion annually.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\n\nWhat makes these projections so bullish? The real surprise lies in the interplay between steady margin assumptions and a future valuation multiple more often seen in faster-growth industries.

Its P/E ratio is 23.5x, above the global beverage industry average of 18.1x, but below its peer average of 26.4x. It also sits just above the fair ratio of 22.7x, signaling that while KO trades at a premium, it is not excessively stretched compared to similar giants. The gap suggests both valuation risk and opportunity depending on how the market\u2019s preferences change. Could KO\u2019s premium hold, or is a reversion closer to that fair ratio possible?\n\nStory Continues\n\nSee what the numbers say about this price \u2014 find out in our valuation breakdown.NYSE:KO PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\n\nBuild Your Own Coca-Cola Narrative\n\nIf you see things differently or want to dig into the numbers yourself, you can build your own view from scratch in just a few minutes.
