The November 18 release of Gemini 3 Pro with its new Deep Think reasoning mode has impressed analysts with benchmarks and pricing that outperformed expectations, especially compared to Microsoft\u2019s recent Ignite conference and ChatGPT 5\u2019s August release.\n\nGemini 3 topped benchmarks for coding, tool use, math, science, and multimodal reasoning. The model is immediately available across Google\u2019s ecosystem and third-party platforms like GitHub and Replit, potentially helping Google\u2019s profitable API business.\n\nGoogle\u2019s custom TPU chip, now in its seventh generation, has become a significant advantage. Reitzes notes that Gemini 3 was trained primarily on Google TPUs, giving Alphabet a price advantage. Outside of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, the TPU is considered the most proven AI chip with the most tangible momentum.\n\nThis progress has created concerns for OpenAI, with CEO Sam Altman acknowledging in an internal memo that Google\u2019s advances could create \"temporary economic headwinds.\" This admission, combined with reports of slower user growth, has impacted investor confidence in OpenAI and affected stocks like Oracle, AMD, Microsoft, CoreWeave, Broadcom, and Nvidia.\n\nAMD and Oracle appear most exposed to OpenAI\u2019s success. AMD has fallen 23% from its October high, while Oracle is down 39% from its September peak. AMD\u2019s deal with OpenAI involves adding 6GW of capacity starting in the second half of 2026, while Oracle has included a $300 billion deal with OpenAI in its RPO backlog.\n\nFor investors seeking safer options amid AI volatility, Reitzes suggests Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Apple is described as a \"toll road\" to mobile AI that can benefit regardless of which company ultimately dominates the AI race. The analyst maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a $345 price target.\n\nIBM offers stability through its mainframe cycle and infrastructure software, with promising developments in quantum computing. Cisco is gaining ground selling optics to hyperscalers for AI while benefiting from a campus switching cycle in enterprise.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) faces challenges from Google\u2019s AI image generation and editing tools, which could potentially draw users away from Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud ecosystem despite their partnership to integrate Gemini 3.\n\nRelated articles\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini 3 advances shake up AI competitive landscape\n\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\n\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-gemini-3-advances-shake-140624037.html", "symbols": ["1GOOG.MI", "1GOOGL.MI", "AAPL.US", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEC.F", "ADBE.US", "AMD.US", "CSCO.US", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.BA"], "tags": ["AI", "EARNINGS", "PRICE TARGET", "PRICE-TARGET", "SEMICONDUCTORS", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.022, "neu": 0.832, "pos": 0.147}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T14:05:00+00:00", "title": "As Business Email Scams Threaten Law Firms, eMazzanti Technologies President Carl Mazzanti Offers Cybersecurity Solutions", "content": "HOBOKEN, N.J., Nov. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Following FBI warnings of advanced Business Email Compromises that target\u00a0law firms, eMazzanti Technologies President and Co-founder Carl Mazzanti recently presented a Continuing Legal Education session \u2014 hosted by LEAP Legal Software \u2014 focusing on how firms can leverage Cybersecurity Solutions to protect themselves, their client funds, and sensitive information. eMazzanti Technologies is a leading Managed Services Provider, Microsoft expert and a key Watchguard partner.eMazzanti Technologies President Carl Mazzanti\n\nDuring the session, Mazzanti highlighted the increasing sophistication of Cybercriminals targeting law firms. \"According to the FBI, Business Email Compromise is one of the most common and financially damaging online crimes,\" he warned. \"Besides the direct financial toll, a successful BEC or other attack can result in significant reputational damage to your firm. Class action lawsuits have been filed against firms, alleging they did not take sufficient steps to guard against Cyberattacks.\"\n\nSolos, small and large law firms alike handle high volumes of PII and other sensitive data, so bad actors are targeting you, he added. \"Nation-state and other Cybercriminals have enhanced their attacks with Artificial Intelligence (AI), so it is crucial to work with an experienced Managed Services Provider like eMazzanti Technologies to stay current with the latest Cybersecurity regulations and best practices.\"\n\nDuring the webinar, Mazzanti discussed various strategies to combat email scams, including the use of AI-powered automated defenses. \"AI is the anti-inflation, and technology can significantly reduce your firm's vulnerability to Cyberattacks,\" Mazzanti explained. \"However, we can also train your employees so they can recognize red flags that signal phishing, fraud and other attacks.\"\n\nBest practices highlighted by Mazzanti include:\n\nSecuring your email with advanced filtering techniques to prevent malicious emails from reaching your inbox Using geo-blocking \u2014 restricting or blocking access to your online content based on a user's geographic location \u2014 to reduce your firm's target profile and enhance security Working with eMazzanti professionals to periodically conduct penetration testing to identify and fix your firm's weak points before bad actors can exploit them. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication as a gatekeeper. This ensures that even if a hacker has your password, they cannot gain access to your systems\n\n\"By staying vigilant and adopting advanced cybersecurity measures, law firms can protect their clients and their reputation from the ever-evolving threats of Cybercrime,\" Mazzanti noted. \"Together, we can build a safer digital environment for all.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor more information about eMazzanti Technologies and our cybersecurity solutions, please visit our website at [www.emazzanti.net](http://www.emazzanti.net); contact us by phone at (201) 360-4400, or email us at info@emazzanti.net](mailto:info@emazzanti.net).\n\nAbout eMazzanti Technologies\n\neMazzanti's team of trained, certified IT experts deliver rapid response, increased revenue growth, data security, and productivity for organizations of all sizes.

Both Micron and SK Hynix enjoy pricing power and multiyear revenue visibility for their HBM and advanced DRAM offerings. SK Hynix is already the leader in the HBM market, while Micron is focused on expanding its market share. 10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology \u203a\n\nInvestors who are looking for high-potential artificial intelligence (AI) stocks often pick well-known semiconductor players such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, hyperscalers such as Amazon and Microsoft, or software players like Palantir and SoundHound AI.\n\nBut many investors are missing one real AI opportunity that's staring us in the face.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI models continue to get larger and more complex. Additionally, as the systems mature, hyperscalers and enterprises are transitioning from infrequent AI training workloads to more frequent AI inferencing workloads. And now, memory bandwidth and capacity are proving to be bigger bottlenecks than AI computing capacity in large AI clusters.\n\nWithin that dynamic, leading memory players such as MicronTechnology(NASDAQ: MU) and SK Hynix (OTC: HXSCL) -- already crucial players in the global buildout of AI infrastructure -- are well-positioned to prosper.\n\nFavorable memory market trends\n\nThe server clusters built around cutting-edge AI processing chips increasingly require higher-performance, energy-efficient, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced DRAM in order to operate efficiently. In fact, every new generation of AI GPUs uses increasingly more HBM and advanced DRAM.\n\nSo naturally, data center companies are increasing their spending on memory as part of their ongoing AI infrastructure buildouts. The global HBM market is forecast to grow from $17 billion in 2024 to $98 billion in 2030, while HBM's revenue share in the DRAM market is estimated to grow from 18% to 50% in that same time frame. This trend favors Micron and SK Hynix, which stand to benefit from the higher memory content of systems designed to handle large, scalable AI workloads.\n\nMicron and South Korea-based SK Hynix can expect to enjoy solid pricing power and higher margins, as there is currently a chronic shortage of advanced DRAM. According to DigiTimes, many major hyperscalers are securing only 70% of their server DRAM orders, despite accepting 50% price hikes in the fourth quarter.\n\nMicron is capitalizing on this opportunity\n\nU.S.-based Micron has gradually transformed itself from a cyclical DRAM and NAND producer into a full-stack, AI-optimized memory and storage player. The company's performance in its fiscal 2025 (which ended Aug. 28) was impressive, with revenues soaring 49% to $37.4 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share surging nearly 538% to $8.29. Increasing memory demand from data center operators has been the key growth catalyst. In fiscal 2025, its data center business accounted for 56% of Micron's total revenues.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicron's DRAM market share was close to 22.5% in September. Management also forecast that its HBM market share would be similar to its DRAM share in the third quarter of calendar 2025, as it ramps its third-generation extended (HBM3E) and fourth-generation (HBM4) HBM products. That was an achievable goal, considering that Micron was already the second-largest player in the HBM market in the second quarter of calendar 2025, with a 21% share, according to market research firm Counterpoint Research.\n\nMicron's HBM strategy seems to have been quite successful, as its HBM revenues reached nearly $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which translates to an annual run rate of close to $8 billion. The company has already entered into pricing agreements for a significant chunk of its HBM3E supply in 2026, and expects to sell out its entire 2026 supply in the next few months.\n\nThe company is also advancing its technology leadership and has ramped up production of its 1-gamma DRAM node to achieve mature yields 50% faster than the previous-generation process node. The company was the first to ship a 1-gamma DRAM chip and plans to leverage its superior process technology across its entire DRAM portfolio.\n\nSK Hynix remains the leader\n\nWhile Micron is slowly expanding its market share, SK Hynix is already the leader in the HBM market, with a 62% share as of the second quarter of 2025. SK Hynix has also completed development of its next-generation HBM4 and plans to begin shipping that product in the fourth quarter, followed by a rapid scale-up of production in 2026.\n\nSK Hynix has also finalized its 2026 HBM supply plan for major clients, and management expects HBM supply to remain tight even in 2027. As memory companies increasingly allocate production capacity to HBM, the marketplace is now experiencing shortages of some traditional memory products, too. SK Hynix is also a leader in the DRAM market, with a 35% share in the third quarter. Hence, some of its customers have started issuing pre-purchase orders for DRAM and NAND products for 2026.\n\nThe company also delivered exceptional performance in the third quarter, as revenues soared 39% year over year to 24.4 trillion Korean won (about $16.6 billion). Operating profit also rose 62% to an all-time high of 11.4 trillion Korean won (about $7.7 billion).\n\nAI winners\n\nSK Hynix expects the AI memory market to grow by almost 30% annually through 2030. The company is also a key HBM supplier to Nvidia; Micron supplies the GPU leader with smaller HBM volumes.\n\nWith a favorable demand environment for their offerings and strong technological advantages, both Micron and SK Hynix are well positioned to keep capturing a significant share of this growing and profitable market.\n\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, these huge complexes, which the company owns or operates through long-term leases, do not account for its full footprint. AWS also has server racks in hundreds of so-called colocation facilities, renting space that as of last year provided about a fifth of the computing power at Amazon\u2019s disposal, the report added [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-24/amazon-data-center-tally-tops-900-amid-ai-frenzy-documents-show?srnd=phx-technology].\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.\n\nKnown as \u201ccolos\u201d in the industry, the rented data centers are usually subdivided among different clients. The AWS presence in such facilities ranges from a few server racks in a dedicated room to most or all of massive buildings in places such as Frankfurt and Tokyo, according to the report.\n\nAWS does not disclose the places of individual data centers for security reasons and to keep operational details out of the hands of rivals. The documents indicate Amazon\u2019s cloud computing operations at a time when investors are interested to know if AWS has enough capacity to meet the large computing demands for AI. They also suggest that AWS is one of the world\u2019s largest renters of colo space, indicating that it has the flexibility to offer customers several services worldwide, the report noted.\n\nAs of early 2024, AWS was depending on over 440 colocation data centers. The company also operated from over 220 additional rented \u201cedge\u201d locations, which provide access points to Amazon\u2019s network near major metropolitan areas, often inside telecommunications facilities operated by third parties, the report added.\n\nAmazon's presence at some of these locations is designed to give customers the ability to swiftly route data from their own servers or those of other cloud providers to Amazon\u2019s own infrastructure, as per the report.\n\nAWS spokesperson Aisha Johnson said to the news outlet that Amazon\u2019s approach to data centers \u201cbalances ownership with flexibility,\u201d and was driven by rising demand for AWS services.\n\n\u201cWhile we own and operate the majority of our data centers, we strategically leverage third-party options when they provide additional capacity or geographic reach,\u201d Johnson noted. \u201cThis long-term planning approach allows us to make precise decisions that align with our customers\u2019 evolving requirements.\u201d\n\nAWS is the world\u2019s largest provider of rented computing power, but its leadership position is being challenged by Microsoft (MSFT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT]) and Alphabet's (GOOG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG]) (GOOGL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL]) Google, which have seen their sales soar alongside the launch of AI services.\n\nData center tracker Baxtel puts Amazon\u2019s data center numbers at 449 across 49 markets. Another provider DC Byte places AWS footprint at 364 facilities in 33 countries. Researchers note that tracking Amazon\u2019s full footprint, including colos, is not possible because the agreements between AWS and its landlords are generally private, the report added.\n\nAmazon collaborates with at least 180 different entities in its colocation arrangements, ranging from colo data center operator Equinix to Japanese telecommunications company NTT, and Markley, which operates a data center in Boston, the report noted.\n\nEnvironmental groups and consumer advocates warn that the rapid rate of data center buildout by companies is straining electricity grids and prolonging the life of fossil-fueled power plants.\n\nJohnson noted that other industries, not just data centers, are contributing to rising energy demand, and that the company is investing billions of dollars in carbon-free energy projects, including renewables and nuclear power. \u201cThese investments are designed to add new clean energy to the grid \u2014 helping to meet growing demand while reducing reliance on fossil fuels over time.\" Johnson added.\n\nMORE ON AMAZON\n\n \t* Amazon: Scoop Up This Bargain Hiding In Plain Sight Now [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846170-amazon-scoop-up-bargain-hiding-in-plain-sight-now]\n \t* Amazon: OpenAI Deal Is A Game Changer [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846091-amazon-openai-deal-is-a-game-changer]\n \t* Amazon: Anthropic X Microsoft Deal Changes Nothing [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845632-amazon-anthropic-x-microsoft-deal-changes-nothing]\n \t* SA Asks: Is Tesla losing the robotaxi race to commercialization?

Both indexes are still set for their \u200dbiggest monthly drops since March, with the Nasdaq still down over 6%.\n\nBesides the concerns around AI valuations that drove that selloff in the first place, optimism around a Fed cut doesn't change that October and November's payroll data -- key to rates expectations -- will only be released after the bank's December meeting.\n\nAnd policymakers are split on the path ahead. Boston Federal Reserve President Susan \u200bCollins said on Saturday she's still leaning against a December rate cut.\n\nU.S. markets will also have to digest retail sales, producer price and jobless claims data this week.\u200c\n\nThey looked subdued otherwise, with the dollar down 0.2% against a basket of currencies, while Treasury yields were largely steady after sizeable drops last week.\n\nIn a sign that risk sentiment remains fragile, Bitcoin dropping 2% to around $86,000, though it has bounced off Friday's low that had left it near the key $80,000 level below which losses may accelerate.\n\nMarkets remain on alert for intervention in the Yen by Japanese authorities, who tend to move in quiet periods with lower liquidity. The yen edged lower against the dollar on Monday, nearing last week's 10-month lows.\n\nThanksgiving could be an opportunity, but analysts are already questioning how effective a move might be.\n\nIn Europe, Ukraine peace talks remain front and centre after the U.\u2060S. and Ukraine agreed to modify an earlier proposal seen as too favourable to Moscow.\n\nEuropean defense stocks,\u200b while sitting on huge gains this year, continued to slide on Monday, dropping to their lowest since August.\u200b\n\nGeopolitics aside, the big focus is on Britain's much anticipated Wednesday budget, when finance minister Rachel Reeves will have to convince investors that she can deliver credible belt-tightening plans after U-turning on plans to raise income tax levels.\n\nBut there is some good fiscal news too. Italy saw its credit \u200drating upgrade from Moody's in 23 years on \u2060Friday.\n\nChart of the day\n\nU.S. equity markets have a long way to come back after last week, still sitting on heavy losses in November that have set them up for their worst monthly performance since March, when tariff worries rattled markets ahead of the big intra-month swing in April.\n\nToday's events to watch\n\n* Two-year U.\u2060S.

(GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META) continues in 2026. These sales have capped a record year of global issuance.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIndia\u2019s Richest Family Powers Push for Green Space in Mumbai Where Train Dreams Meet Reality in Texas San Francisco Hotels That Echoed City\u2019s Decline Sell for 75% Off Despite Star Architect\u2019s Alleged Misconduct, New Harlem and Princeton Museums Shine High-Rises Are Changing the Slovak Capital of Bratislava Beyond Recognition\n\nWith tech firms expected to turn to debt for as much as $1.5 trillion by 2028 to fund expansion in artificial intelligence and data centers, that could widen spreads across the whole market, Morgan Stanley argues. Bond buyers are starting to worry about being compensated for the risks of a bubble in the sector, given recent turmoil in tech stocks.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is that a flood of data center financing could cause supply indigestion, particularly in dollars, but with euro markets also absorbing part of the funding needs,\u201d said JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Matthew Bailey.\n\nInvestors are now questioning whether these massive investments in artificial intelligence will pay off. There are no broad signs of panic in credit, with many of the sales so far having come from top-tier names.\n\nAlphabet raised $17.5 billion in the US and \u20ac6.5 billion ($7.5 billion) in Europe, the second-largest corporate deal in the region this year, while Meta sold $30 billion and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) did $18 billion. Demand was huge, with Meta getting a record peak orderbook of $125 billion.\n\nSupply Glut\n\nHedge fund Man Group Plc noted that high-yield firms are also issuing, including former bitcoin miners. These companies\u2019 data center plans come with \u201caggressive deadlines\u201d and a heavy reliance on the supporting lease contracts, it said in a blog post titled \u201cWhy Bond Investors Aren\u2019t Totally Buying the AI Hype.\u201d\n\n\u201cA glut of supply of lower quality names in the AI space might be too much for markets to stomach,\u201d Man Group\u2019s Jon Lahraoui and Hugo Richardson wrote. \u201cThe hyperscaler frenzy continues, but we remain watchful of future AI slop,\u201d they added.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Bailey estimates that Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, (META) Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) alone have capital expenditure needs of around $570 billion for 2026, up from $125 billion back in 2021. Meanwhile UBS Group AG sees total tech debt supply at over $900 billion next year.\n\nLeer m\u00e1s\n\nThe fact that the big players have strong balance sheets and significant capacity to take on debt means they can offer new issue premiums to appeal to investors that other borrowers may be forced to match, Morgan Stanley analysts warned.\n\n\u201cTech issuers have also shown themselves to be less price-sensitive given the strategic importance of these projects \u2014 a dynamic that can still reprice the broader market,\u201d the US bank said in its recent Global Insights outlook report. \u201cLarge issuers who are less sensitive to price is a new dynamic credit markets haven\u2019t contended with for a long time.\u201d\n\nStill Underinvested\n\nSpreads in the corporate bond market have been mostly range bound this year after recovering from the blow out on April\u2019s US tariff announcements. Driving this has been the huge swathes of cash flowing into the asset class, chasing yields at high levels compared to recent years.\n\nFor European investment-grade investors, the rise in issuance from Big Tech and its diversification for the euro market gives an opportunity for exposure that is currently still underrepresented, according to Marco Stoeckle, head of credit strategy at Commerzbank AG.\n\n\u201cEuro investors are essentially underinvested in high quality US tech issuers,\u201d he said. \u201cDemand therefore should not be the main problem as long as credit profiles remain on the right track.\u201d\n\nMonetization Risk\n\nEven with record overall bond supply in Europe this year, it hasn\u2019t been enough to satiate this demand. Next year, global investment-grade bond issuance is seen rising by 3% in euros and 13% in dollars, skewed toward non-financial companies and AI-related spending from tech firms and utilities, HSBC Holdings Plc wrote in its market outlook.\n\nFinancing AI capex is becoming a defining feature of the fixed income world, according to Brandywine Global Investment Managment portfolio manager Tracy Chen. While she likes data center asset-backed securities for stable credit fundamentals and relative insulation from any consumer fragility, she highlighted future monetization risk, or the potential to generate enough revenues.\n\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology initiative this year released a report indicating that 95% of organizations are getting zero return from generative AI projects. Investors and lenders are already hedging their bets by trading more derivatives that offer payouts if individual tech companies default on their debt.\n\n\u201cRefinancing risk and the maturity wall will become more acute if the macro market destabilizes,\u201d Chen said.

But those sorts of enormous complexes, which the company owns or operates through long-term leases, don\u2019t account for its full footprint. The cloud unit also stashes server racks in hundreds of so-called colocation facilities, renting space that as of last year provided about a fifth of the computing power at Amazon\u2019s disposal, according to the documents.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIndia\u2019s Richest Family Powers\u00a0Push for Green Space in Mumbai San Francisco Hotels That Echoed City\u2019s Decline Sell for 75% Off Where Train\u00a0Dreams Meet Reality in Texas Despite Star Architect\u2019s Alleged Misconduct, New Harlem and Princeton Museums Shine High-Rises\u00a0Are Changing the Slovak Capital of Bratislava Beyond Recognition\n\nCalled \u201ccolos\u201d in the industry, the rented data centers are typically sub-divided among different clients. The AWS presence in such facilities ranges from a few server racks in a dedicated room to most or all of enormous buildings in places like Frankfurt and Tokyo, the documents show.An Amazon Web Services data center in Stone Ridge, Virginia, US.Photographer: Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nAWS doesn\u2019t disclose the locations of individual data centers for security reasons and to keep operational details out of the hands of competitors. The documents shine a light on Amazon\u2019s cloud computing operations at a time when investors are keen for insights into whether AWS has sufficient capacity to meet the enormous computing demands for artificial intelligence. They also show that AWS is one of the world\u2019s largest renters of colo space, suggesting it has the flexibility to offer customers a range of services around the globe.\n\n\u201cThere are big data centers everyone talks about, but the reality is there are also these smaller cloud resources that are invisible,\u201d said Nic Benders, chief technical strategist at New Relic, which helps businesses manage their technology infrastructure. \u201cThe cloud providers do not like to tell you where they are.\u201d\n\nAs of early 2024, AWS was relying on more than 440 colocation data centers. The company also operated from more than 220 additional rented \u201cedge\u201d locations, which provide access points to Amazon\u2019s network near major metropolitan areas, often inside telecommunications hubs operated by third parties. The company\u2019s presence at some of these sites is designed to give customers the ability to quickly route data from their own servers or those of other cloud providers to Amazon\u2019s own infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAWS spokesperson Aisha Johnson said Amazon\u2019s approach to data centers \u201cbalances ownership with flexibility,\u201d and was driven by rising demand for AWS services.\n\n\u201cWhile we own and operate the majority of our data centers, we strategically leverage third-party options when they provide additional capacity or geographic reach,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cThis long-term planning approach allows us to make precise decisions that align with our customers\u2019 evolving requirements.\u201d\n\nAWS is the world\u2019s largest seller of rented computing power, though that leadership position is being tested by rivals like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which have seen their sales surge alongside the rollout of AI services. Still, Amazon\u2019s cloud unit produced $33 billion in revenue in the third quarter and remains the company\u2019s most-profitable division, contributing $11.4 billion in operating income in the period.\n\nFor many people, AWS\u2019 reach became clear last month when a malfunction in a key database service knocked out web sites around the world, an episode that lasted about 15 hours before the company was able to fully restore service.\n\nAmazon has periodically offered clues to the scale of its server farm footprint. In late 2023, then-AWS chief Adam Selipsky said Amazon had three times the number of data centers of its nearest competitor. That\u2019s Microsoft, which at the time was touting a fleet of 300 buildings.\n\nBaxtel, a data center tracker, places Amazon\u2019s footprint at 449 data centers across 49 markets. DC Byte, another provider, pegs the AWS fleet at 364 facilities in 33 countries. Researchers say tracking Amazon\u2019s full footprint \u2014 including colos \u2014 is impossible because the agreements between AWS and its landlords are generally private.\n\nAll told, Amazon partners with at least 180 different entities in its colocation arrangements, the documents show, ranging from colo data center operator Equinix Inc. to Japanese telecommunications giant NTT Inc. and Markley, which operates a data center in Boston.\n\nWhen an AWS customer \u2014 from Netflix Inc. to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u2013 rents computing power from Amazon, they do so from any of 38 regions around the world. Each region is powered by at least three data centers, further dividing Amazon\u2019s network into what the company calls availability zones.\n\nAmazon\u2019s preference, industry analysts say, is to own facilities or operate them on long-term leases, particularly in the US, its most important market. After 20 years of operating data centers, the company believes it can operate the facilities more efficiently than partners. AWS owns about 24 million square feet of buildings. It leases roughly the same amount, according to the company\u2019s annual report.\n\nBut Amazon also taps into space from third parties, especially when setting up shop in new areas or trying to quickly respond to changes in demand. The company has been racing in recent years to keep up with rising use of its services, both to support businesses migrating their software to Amazon\u2019s servers and meet new demand to train and power AI services. In China, local laws require the company to sell its services alongside a joint venture partner.\n\nLooking at electricity consumption \u2013 a measure of the intensity of computing use inside a facility \u2013 some of AWS\u2019 biggest colocation data centers are in or on the outskirts of major cities, the documents show. That includes facilities in and around Frankfurt, Montreal, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo.\n\nExplainer: How the Data Center Boom Tests Grids, Capital Markets\n\nEnvironmental groups and consumer advocates have warned that the rapid data center buildout by Amazon and its biggest rivals is straining electricity grids and prolonging the life of fossil-fueled power plants. Amazon has been the biggest corporate backer of renewable energy projects in recent years, one element of its aim to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. At the same time, its megaprojects in places like Indiana and Mississippi are helping spur the construction of new natural gas plants.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Johnson said other industries \u2014 not just data centers \u2014 are contributing to rising energy demand, and that the company is investing billions of dollars in carbon-free energy projects, including renewables and nuclear power. \u201cThese investments are designed to add new clean energy to the grid \u2014 helping to meet growing demand while reducing reliance on fossil fuels over time,\u201d she said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPermabull Tom Lee Sees Bitcoin as High as $200,000 by January\u2019s End The Dirty Secret of Biodegradable Plastic Weed Drinks That Get You Very, Very High Could Be Gone Soon Cutting Ties With China Is Harder Than Companies Expected The New Requirement for MBAs Seeking Consulting Jobs: AI Proficiency\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-data-center-tally-tops-110000218.html", "symbols": ["1AMZN.MI", "AMZ.DU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.HM", "AMZ.MU", "AMZ1.F", "AMZN.BA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.SN", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "MSFT.US"], "tags": ["AI", "CLOUD-COMPUTING", "DATA-CENTERS", "OPERATING INCOME", "RENEWABLE-ENERGY", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.901, "pos": 0.081}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T10:30:00+00:00", "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog ServiceNow, Microsoft, Atlassian and Salesforce", "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 24, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeServiceNow NOW, Microsoft MSFT, Atlassian TEAM and Salesforce CRM.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nServiceNow Deepens Partnership with Microsoft: Can It Drive Top-Line Growth?\n\nServiceNow is expanding integrations with Microsoft, including a new one with Microsoft Agent 365 targeted at providing seamless, enterprise-grade orchestration, governance, and collaboration across AI agents and workflows. The expanded partnership connects ServiceNow\u2019s AI Platform with Microsoft 365, Copilot, Foundry and GitHub. These integrations will help enterprises manage autonomous AI agents with unified controls, consistent policies, and end-to-end visibility.\n\nThe deepening relationship between ServiceNow and Microsoft will now integrate NOW\u2019s AI Control Tower with Microsoft Foundry and Copilot Studio to automatically discover, manage, and enforce governance across AI agents running on Microsoft platforms. ServiceNow Build Agent now integrates with GitHub\u2019s Model Context Protocol Server, allowing secure access to GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions. Moreover, an upcoming integration between ServiceNow\u2019s Now Assist and Microsoft Agent 365 will bring enterprise workflows directly into Word, Outlook and Teams.\n\nThe expanding Microsoft collaboration bodes well for ServiceNow\u2019s prospects. NOW\u2019s expanding portfolio, growing workflow adoption and rich partner base are expected to improve its top-line growth.\n\nServiceNow raised subscription revenue guidance for 2025 post third-quarter 2025 results, which is now expected between $12.835 billion and $12.845 billion, suggesting 20% on a non-GAAP constant currency (cc) basis and 20.5% on a reported basis from 2024\u2019s reported figure. However, this is slower than NOW\u2019s subscription revenue growth rate of 23% in 2024. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2025 guidance reflects tightening budgets of the U.S. federal agencies, which is expected to hurt subscription revenues.\n\nTough Competition Hurts NOW\u2019s Prospects\n\nNOW faces stiff competition from the likes of Atlassian and Salesforce. Atlassian is a global leader and innovator in the enterprise collaboration and workflow software space. The company is poised to grow given the rising demand for automated and improved communication systems within organizations. Atlassian is currently focused on selling more subscription-based solutions. Subscriptions have been the company\u2019s fastest-growing segment, which has witnessed a CAGR of approximately 40% between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSalesforce is focusing on enhancing its AI capabilities and data cloud business. Data Cloud platform pulls customer data from many systems and makes it usable across Salesforce products. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company reported a 140% year-over-year surge in Data Cloud customer adoption.\n\nSalesforce is also integrating the Data Cloud platform with its other tools like Agentforce, Tableau and Slack. These integrations are helping enterprises easily analyze their data and apply AI across operations. CRM\u2019s Agentforce has secured more than 6,000 paid deals since its launch just three quarters ago, indicating strong demand for AI tools that enhance enterprise workflows.\n\nNOW\u2019s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\n\nNOW shares have dropped 24.6% year to date, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s return of 25.9%.\n\nServiceNow stock is overvalued, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 10.83X compared with the broader sector\u2019s 6.61X.

Wall Street remains bullish about all three stocks after their recent declines. Other quantum computing stocks also enjoy Wall Street's favor, including Quantum Computing Inc. and Microsoft. 10 stocks we like better than D-Wave Quantum \u203a\n\nHow do you determine which stock is the best pick in a given market? Some investors turn to Wall Street analysts for their opinions. After all, these analysts are paid big bucks to thoroughly research the stocks they cover. And a lot of research is required in a complex field like quantum computing.\n\nIf you're considering investing in up-and-coming quantum computing stocks D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS), IonQ(NYSE: IONQ), or Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), it could be helpful to know what analysts think. Which of these stocks is Wall Street most bullish about?Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRising quantum computing stars with different approaches\n\nWhile D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti are rising stars in the development of quantum computers, each company is taking a distinct approach. Their technological strategies could ultimately determine which of them achieves tremendous success or flames out.\n\nD-Wave uses quantum annealing in the development of its quantum computers. This method utilizes superconductors, which exhibit zero electrical resistance at extremely low temperatures. One major plus of D-Wave's quantum annealing technology is that it already markets useful quantum computers. The key downside, however, is that the technology is geared toward specific applications, such as optimization and search, rather than general-purpose computing.\n\nIonQ is the leader in developing quantum systems based on a trapped-ion architecture. This architecture involves trapping ions of a rare-earth metal called ytterbium. The company uses these trapped ions to create qubits, which are used to construct logical gates for executing algorithms. IonQ's trapped-ion approach requires less cooling than superconducting approaches. Its error correction rate is also superior to other methods.\n\nLike D-Wave, Rigetti Computing employs superconductors to develop quantum computers. Instead of using quantum annealing, though, Rigetti creates superconducting qubits to construct logical gates. The company's Cepheus-1-36Q currently ranks as the world's largest multi-chip quantum computer.\n\nWhat Wall Street thinks about D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti?\n\nAfter soaring earlier this year, shares of D-Wave Quantum, IonQ, and Rigetti Computing have plunged at least 50% below their peaks since last month. Despite their recent declines, Wall Street remains bullish about all three of these quantum computing stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSix of the nine analysts surveyed by S&P Global(NYSE: SPGI) in November who cover IonQ rated the stock as either a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\" The other three analysts recommended holding the stock. The consensus 12-month price target for IonQ reflects a potential upside of 72%.\n\nEnthusiasm also runs high for Rigetti. Six of the seven analysts surveyed by S&P Global in November gave the stock a \"buy\" or better rating, with the sole outlier recommending holding shares. The average price target for Rigetti is 74% above the current share price.\n\nHowever, Wall Street appears to be most bullish about D-Wave Quantum. Nine out of 10 analysts assigned \"buy\" or \"strong buy\" ratings to the stock. The consensus price target reflects a potential upside of 85%.

Some investors turn to Wall Street analysts for their opinions. After all, these analysts are paid big bucks to thoroughly research the stocks they cover. And a lot of research is required in a complex field like quantum computing.\n\nIf you're considering investing in up-and-coming quantum computing stocks D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS), IonQ(NYSE: IONQ), or Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), it could be helpful to know what analysts think.

Continue \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRising quantum computing stars with different approaches\n\nWhile D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti are rising stars in the development of quantum computers, each company is taking a distinct approach. Their technological strategies could ultimately determine which of them achieves tremendous success or flames out.\n\nD-Wave uses quantum annealing in the development of its quantum computers. This method utilizes superconductors, which exhibit zero electrical resistance at extremely low temperatures. One major plus of D-Wave's quantum annealing technology is that it already markets useful quantum computers. The key downside, however, is that the technology is geared toward specific applications, such as optimization and search, rather than general-purpose computing.\n\nIonQ is the leader in developing quantum systems based on a trapped-ion architecture. This architecture involves trapping ions of a rare-earth metal called ytterbium. The company uses these trapped ions to create qubits, which are used to construct logical gates for executing algorithms. IonQ's trapped-ion approach requires less cooling than superconducting approaches. Its error correction rate is also superior to other methods.\n\nLike D-Wave, Rigetti Computing employs superconductors to develop quantum computers. Instead of using quantum annealing, though, Rigetti creates superconducting qubits to construct logical gates. The company's Cepheus-1-36Q currently ranks as the world's largest multi-chip quantum computer.\n\nWhat Wall Street thinks about D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti?\n\nAfter soaring earlier this year, shares of D-Wave Quantum, IonQ, and Rigetti Computing have plunged at least 50% below their peaks since last month. Despite their recent declines, Wall Street remains bullish about all three of these quantum computing stocks.\n\nSix of the nine analysts surveyed by S&P Global(NYSE: SPGI) in November who cover IonQ rated the stock as either a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\" The other three analysts recommended holding the stock. The consensus 12-month price target for IonQ reflects a potential upside of 72%.\n\nEnthusiasm also runs high for Rigetti. Six of the seven analysts surveyed by S&P Global in November gave the stock a \"buy\" or better rating, with the sole outlier recommending holding shares. The average price target for Rigetti is 74% above the current share price.\n\nHowever, Wall Street appears to be most bullish about D-Wave Quantum. Nine out of 10 analysts assigned \"buy\" or \"strong buy\" ratings to the stock. The consensus price target reflects a potential upside of 85%. There's one fly in the ointment, though: The lone contrarian analyst thinks D-Wave will underperform over the near term.\n\nOther quantum computing stocks that Wall Street likes\n\nInvestors don't have to limit their horizons to only D-Wave Quantum, IonQ, and Rigetti Computing.

The index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning its largest constituents have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft are the world's most valuable companies, with a combined market capitalization of $11.9 trillion, and all three are in the information technology sector. Hence, this is the largest sector in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.\n\nHere are the top five sectors in the index, along with their weightings, and some of their most noteworthy stocks.\n\nSector Sector Weighting Noteworthy Stocks Information technology 35.06% Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple Financials 13.03% Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Communication services 10.32% Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix Consumer discretionary 10.05% Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's  Healthcare 9.75% Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie\n\nData source: Vanguard, State Street. Sector weightings are accurate as of Nov. 19, 2025, and are subject to change.\n\nThe other six sectors in the S&P 500 are industrials, consumer staples, energy, utilities, real estate, and materials, so the index is highly diversified.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, it's hard to ignore the significant influence of the information technology sector. The S&P 500 soared by 214% over the last 10 years, and the information technology sector was responsible for more than half of that overall gain, thanks to its own eye-popping return of 640%. In fact, if we exclude the sector entirely, the S&P's return over the last decade shrinks to just 79%.\n\nThis dynamic is likely to remain in place thanks to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, quantum computing, and more, which could fuel significant returns in stocks like Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the most cost-effective ways for investors to gain like-for-like exposure to the S&P 500. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. In dollar terms, an investment of $10,000 would incur an annual fee of just $3, whereas that fee could be as high as $74 in other funds, according to Vanguard.\n\nTurning $500 per month into $1 million\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered a compound annual return of 10.5% since its inception in 1957, and if it continues to grow at that pace, it could turn a consistent monthly investment of $500 into $1 million in under 30 years:\n\nMonthly Investment Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $500 $106,829 $409,298 $1,269,709\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nThe S&P has delivered an even better average annual return of 14.4% over the last five years, as themes like AI fueled incredible growth for some of the index's largest constituents, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and more.

According to Capital Group, the index experiences a decline of 10% or more once every two and a half years, on average, and it slips into a bear market (a decline of 20% or more) every six years.

Historical headwinds, such as the astronomical price-to-sales ratios of quantum computing stocks, are front and center for investors. However, the most significant risk for pure-play quantum computing stocks comes from a group of \"magnificent\" companies that are flush with cash and craving large addressable opportunities. 10 stocks we like better than IonQ \u203a\n\nOver the last three years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the primary catalyst driving Wall Street's major stock indexes to record highs. But in 2025, it's taken a back seat to a technology that's produced truly jaw-dropping gains.\n\nOver the trailing year, as of the closing bell on Nov. 19, quantum computing pure-play stocksIonQ(NYSE: IONQ), Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT) have delivered respective returns of 90%, 1,860%, 1,530%, and 385%. For comparison, the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite has rallied 20% over the trailing year.\n\nGains of this magnitude imply that investor hype surrounding quantum computing is tangible and may not fade anytime soon. While there are viable reasons to be excited about the real-world applications of Wall Street's hottest innovation, the biggest risk of all to this quartet of quantum computing stocks has gone virtually undetected by the investing populace.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did quantum computing stocks go parabolic in 2025?\n\nIn simple terms, quantum computing involves the use of specialized computers that can make rapid, simultaneous calculations at a considerably faster pace than the world's quickest supercomputers. Quantum computers are capable of tackling complex problems that classical computers are ill-equipped to handle.\n\nOne example of the real-world utility of quantum computers is their ability to speed up the real-time processing and learning capabilities of AI algorithms. Split-second decision-making is particularly important for AI software and systems.\n\nInvestors have also been enamored with the high ceiling for quantum computing hardware and services. Boston Consulting Group estimates this technology can add $450 billion to $850 billion to the global economy by 2040. Meanwhile, online publication The Quantum Insider is looking for this worldwide economic impact to reach the $1 trillion plateau by 2035.\n\nBut if there's one tangible factor that's really lit a fire under the shares of IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. in recent months, it's the prospect of brand-name collaborations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor instance, \"Magnificent Seven\" members Amazon and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are both giving their respective quantum-cloud service subscribers access to IonQ's and Rigetti's quantum computers. Amazon's Braket and Microsoft's Azure Quantum can allow clients to run simulations and test their quantum computing hardware.\n\nAdditionally, quantum computing pure-play stocks soared following an Oct. 13 announcement from banking giant JPMorgan Chase that it plans to make direct equity and venture capital investments in 27 \"sub-areas.\" Quantum computing was one of these 27 investment targets identified by JPMorgan's initial research.\n\nAlthough everything would seem to be going swimmingly for quantum computing pure-play stocks, their parabolic ascent may prove fleeting.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis under-the-radar risk threatens to wipe out the first-mover advantage of pure-play stocks\n\nHistory tells us there are several reasons to be skeptical of the supercharged returns for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc.\n\nTo begin with, every hyped technology and game-changing innovation since the arrival of the internet in the mid-1990s has eventually navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly an innovation or trend would earn widespread adoption, gain utility, and/or be optimized.

Historical headwinds, such as the astronomical price-to-sales ratios of quantum computing stocks, are front and center for investors.  However, the most significant risk for pure-play quantum computing stocks comes from a group of \"magnificent\" companies that are flush with cash and craving large addressable opportunities.10 stocks we like better than IonQ \u203a\n\nOver the last three years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the primary catalyst driving Wall Street's major stock indexes to record highs. But in 2025, it's taken a back seat to a technology that's produced truly jaw-dropping gains.\n\nOver the trailing year, as of the closing bell on Nov. 19, quantum computing pure-play stocksIonQ(NYSE: IONQ), Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT) have delivered respective returns of 90%, 1,860%, 1,530%, and 385%. For comparison, the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite has rallied 20% over the trailing year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nGains of this magnitude imply that investor hype surrounding quantum computing is tangible and may not fade anytime soon. While there are viable reasons to be excited about the real-world applications of Wall Street's hottest innovation, the biggest risk of all to this quartet of quantum computing stocks has gone virtually undetected by the investing populace.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did quantum computing stocks go parabolic in 2025?\n\nIn simple terms, quantum computing involves the use of specialized computers that can make rapid, simultaneous calculations at a considerably faster pace than the world's quickest supercomputers. Quantum computers are capable of tackling complex problems that classical computers are ill-equipped to handle.\n\nOne example of the real-world utility of quantum computers is their ability to speed up the real-time processing and learning capabilities of AI algorithms. Split-second decision-making is particularly important for AI software and systems.\n\nInvestors have also been enamored with the high ceiling for quantum computing hardware and services. Boston Consulting Group estimates this technology can add $450 billion to $850 billion to the global economy by 2040. Meanwhile, online publication The Quantum Insider is looking for this worldwide economic impact to reach the $1 trillion plateau by 2035.\n\nBut if there's one tangible factor that's really lit a fire under the shares of IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. in recent months, it's the prospect of brand-name collaborations.\n\nFor instance, \"Magnificent Seven\" members Amazon and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are both giving their respective quantum-cloud service subscribers access to IonQ's and Rigetti's quantum computers. Amazon's Braket and Microsoft's Azure Quantum can allow clients to run simulations and test their quantum computing hardware.\n\nAdditionally, quantum computing pure-play stocks soared following an Oct. 13 announcement from banking giant JPMorgan Chase that it plans to make direct equity and venture capital investments in 27 \"sub-areas.\" Quantum computing was one of these 27 investment targets identified by JPMorgan's initial research.\n\nAlthough everything would seem to be going swimmingly for quantum computing pure-play stocks, their parabolic ascent may prove fleeting.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis under-the-radar risk threatens to wipe out the first-mover advantage of pure-play stocks\n\nHistory tells us there are several reasons to be skeptical of the supercharged returns for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc.\n\nTo begin with, every hyped technology and game-changing innovation since the arrival of the internet in the mid-1990s has eventually navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly an innovation or trend would earn widespread adoption, gain utility, and/or be optimized. This eventually leads to lofty investor expectations not being met.\n\nQuantum computing is still in the very early stages of commercialization, which exposes it to a high risk of a bubble-bursting event.\n\nFurthermore, quantum computing stock valuations are otherworldly. Whereas price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 in market-leading businesses have historically alerted investors to potential stock market bubbles, the forward-year P/S ratios for IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. are many multiples above this historical mark.\n\nBut there's an even bigger risk to these four quantum computing stocks that virtually everyone is missing.

Even with that long history, this is one of its largest deals. Nonetheless, it pales in comparison to Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI.\n\nThe relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft dates back to 2019, predating the 2021 founding of Anthropic. But time is not the only factor. Microsoft and OpenAI announced an updated agreement on Oct. 28.

That represents a 27% stake based on OpenAI's valuation from recent fundraising rounds.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI is under contract with Microsoft to purchase $250 billion worth of Azure services through 2032.

OpenAI and Microsoft are each free to \"independently continue advancing innovation and growth.\" In other words, Microsoft can partner with whichever players in the AI space it wants to.\n\nMoreover, now Microsoft will provide the computational horsepower to both Anthropic's Claude AI and OpenAI's ChatGPT, making Azure the critical cloud ecosystem for a significant portion of the AI environment.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOpenAI's latest agreement with Microsoft explicitly spells out where the companies can work separately and together on artificial general intelligence (AGI). Analysts often refer to AGI as \"human-level intelligence AI,\" meaning that, in theory, such systems could match or surpass human capabilities in cognitive tasks. Depending on where AGI advances, Microsoft is now more strongly positioned to capitalize on those innovations.\n\nThese deals position Microsoft to benefit from more technological innovations driven by two of the most advanced AI models. It also provides it with the flexibility to work more with Anthropic should its offerings stand out over time.\n\nUltimately, the OpenAI partnership remains Microsoft's most important AI agreement, but this Anthropic deal cements\u00a0 Microsoft's position as a more critical AI company.\n\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia has made several partnerships to strengthen its artificial intelligence (AI) leadership.10 stocks we like better than Nvidia \u203a\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has asserted itself as the leader of the artificial intelligence (AI) data revolution, primarily because of the essentialness of its graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nNvidia's GPUs are the brains behind the AI applications driving the new tech boom, like ChatGPT and similar generative AI tools, and the company is estimated to have more than a 90% share of the data center GPU market, which is where the AI revolution is happening.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nThe chip giant's success is the fruit of decades of planning and investment, beginning with its invention of the GPU in 1999 and followed but its CUDA software library that helps make its GPUs easy to use for developers, creating stickiness.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\nPartnerships and alliances\n\nHowever, since the initial frenzy following the ChatGPT launch, Nvidia has established itself as the kingpin of AI in another way. It's forged a vast network of partnerships and alliances, connecting it to many of the other top players in AI, and reinforcing their dependence on Nvidia.\n\nThose include:\n\nArm Holdings: Nvidia owns 1.1 million shares in Arm, and works closely with it on products like the Arm-based Grace Blackwell Superchip.CoreWeave: Nvidia owns 24.3 million shares in CoreWeave, one of the two major neocloud, or AI-specific cloud computing platforms. Nvidia helped prop up CoreWeave's IPO, and the two companies are customers of one another.Nebius: Nebius is the other major neocloud provider, and Nvidia owns 1.19 million shares of Nebius. Like CoreWeave, Nebius depends heavily on Nvidia hardware.Intel: Nvidia surprised the market by agreeing to take a $5 billion stake in Intel back in September, and the two plan to work together on certain AI and personal computing products. OpenAI: Also in September, Nvidia announced a deal with OpenAI to invest $100 billion in the start-up over time, while OpenAI said it would deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers with Nvidia systems over time.\n\nOn the heels of the partnerships with Intel and OpenAI, Nvidia is now making a big move with another AI start-up, Anthropic.\n\nWhat Nvidia is doing with Anthropic\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia announced a blockbuster deal Tuesday morning with Anthropic. Microsoft will invest $5 billion in the start-up, while Nvidia will put in $10 billion, a move that will push Anthropic's valuation up to around $350 billion, about double where it was in its last funding round in September.\n\nBoth tech giants will form strategic partnerships with Anthropic as well. Anthropic has committed to purchase $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure and to contract additional compute capacity of up to 1 gigawatt, which comes from Nvidia chips, after an initial commitment of 1 gigawatt from Grace Blackwell and the upcoming Vera Rubin systems. The two companies will also work together to optimize Nvidia architecture for Anthropic workloads.\n\nWhat the Anthropic deal means for Nvidia\n\nWith the investment and partnership with Anthropic, Nvidia is tying itself to the No. 2 generative AI start-up, hedging its bet against OpenAI. Microsoft is doing the same thing, in fact.\n\nDoing so makes sense for Nvidia. By investing in these companies, it ensures it has a stake in them and a seat at the table. The partnerships mean that the start-ups are even more dependent on Nvidia, and it helps give it an edge over the competition, though OpenAI also signed a deal with AMD.\n\nThe surge in Anthropic's valuation could add to concerns about a bubble, but the start-up is aiming for $9 billion in run-rate revenue by the end of the year, and nearly tripling run-rate revenue to $26 billion. Based on that forecast, it's understandable why Nvidia and Microsoft would want to own a piece of Anthropic.\n\nFor Nvidia, the Anthropic deal might be its most important deal yet -- that title probably goes to the OpenAI deal -- but it's another savvy move that should only further cement its status as the dominant force in AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Still others attended pre-conference events in Brazil's finance hub Sao Paulo and in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nTech firms including Microsoft and Google, \u200cenergy company Occidental Petroleum, carmaker General Motors and lender Citigroup were among those represented on a provisional U.N. list of attendees of the official summit.\n\n\"We've seen no discernible change in the engagement of U.S. \u200ccompanies on climate policy over the course of this year. And that was certainly reflected in attendance levels,\" said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general for policy at the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"We are also seeing growing concern across industry about the growing costs of extreme weather events \u2014 underscoring the need for effective policy responses.\"\n\nExecutives said they didn't think now was a good time to opt out of the climate conversation, with rising temperatures unleashing ever more threats to factories, supply chains and the bottom line.\n\n\"We're doing it because it's good for the business. It \u2060helps create supply security,\" said PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer (\u200cCSO) Jim Andrew on the sidelines of the talks.\n\n\"We need farmers to be successful, we need them to keep farming,\" he added, given the company makes the bulk of its revenues from foods including Walkers Crisps and Quaker Oats.\n\nFILLING THE VOID\n\nDarren Woods, the boss of top U.\u200dS. oil company ExxonMobil was among the U.S. executives, mayors and other sub-national leaders who attended the pre-COP events.\n\nAll those players have an important role in the future of climate action, according to Lou Leonard, Inaugural Dean of Clark University's School of Climate, Environment, and Society.\n\nExisting policies from federal and non-federal actors would lead to a 35% reduction in U.S. emissions by 2035, \u200ba recent analysis led by the Center for Global Sustainability (CGS) at the University of Maryland showed.\n\nMuch of that is being driven by companies.\n\n\"Despite the headlines, the private sector \u200ccontinues to invest in and deploy clean energy,\" said Gina McCarthy, former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and now Managing Co-Chair of 'America Is All In', a coalition of non-federal leaders.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Last year, clean energy jobs in the U.S. expanded three times faster than the rest of the nation's workforce.\"\n\nThe two-week-long COP30 conference also included many smaller U.S. companies in sectors set to profit from the world's shift to low-carbon energy, including in carbon markets.\n\n\"Being here is about connecting globally,\" said Brennan Spellacy, chief executive at carbon credits platform Patch, \"Most of my meetings here are with English, French, and German sustainability leaders and CSOs.\"\n\nU.S. \u2060COMPANIES HAVE A CRUCIAL ROLE\n\nPresident Trump has called climate change a hoax. But regardless of the U.S. \u200bfederal position, regulations are changing across the world to hasten the energy transition even though the final deal at COP30 \u200bdisappointed some.\n\n\"Irrespective of what's coming out of the United States, in terms of rhetoric, the market is moving (and) policymakers are recognising the direction of travel,\" said Jack Hurd, head of both the World Economic Forum's Earth System Agenda and the Tropical Forest Alliance. \u200d\n\nMore U.S. companies are also disclosing their \u2060climate strategies despite the U.S. dropping plans for a federal rule requiring it, although the quality of plans from companies across the globe remains low, data from disclosure platform CDP showed.\n\nWhether they were at the main event or not, the fact U.S. companies appeared was significant, said Maria Mendiluce, CEO at the We Mean Business Coalition.\u2060\n\n\"The U.S. has a decisive role in global climate, energy and industrial policy, so sub-national leaders, non-state actors and businesses showing up at COP30 matters.\"\n\n\"Even when domestic politics are unsettled, the \u200cU.S. shapes markets, capital flows and technology pathways.

Keeping that in mind, here are two industry titans with attractive long-term potential and one whose momentum may slow.\n\nOne Mega-Cap Stock to Sell:\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS)\n\nMarket Cap: $251.4 billion\n\nFounded in 1924 during the post-WWI economic boom by former JP Morgan partners, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a global financial services firm that provides investment banking, wealth management, and investment management services to corporations, governments, institutions, and individuals.\n\nWhy Does MS Fall Short?\n\nLarge asset base makes it harder to grow tangible book value per share quickly, and its annual tangible book value per share growth of 1.7% over the last five years was below our standards for the financials sector\n\nMorgan Stanley is trading at $158.65 per share, or 15.3x forward P/E.

It produces mission-critical software and bundles it together, resulting in cream-of-the-crop gross margins. The company's elite unit economics lead to robust profit margins that improve over time. This speaks to the scale advantages and operating efficiency across its diverse portfolio, which spans everything from Office and Azure to Minecraft. Microsoft has a virtuous cycle of returns. Its dominant market position enables it to generate strong free cash flow, and it reinvests these funds into promising ventures that further strengthen its competitive moat.\n\nAt $473.18 per share, Microsoft trades at 28.7x forward price-to-earnings.

See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it\u2019s free for active Edge members.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMcDonald's (MCD)\n\nMarket Cap: $220.3 billion\n\nWith nicknames spanning Mickey D's in the U.S. to Makku in Japan, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a fast-food behemoth known for its convenience and broken ice cream machines.\n\nWhy Should MCD Be on Your Watchlist?\n\nAggressive expansion of new stores reflects an offensive push to quickly grow and sell in markets where it has few or no locations Attractive franchise model leads to wonderful unit economics and a best-in-class gross margin of 57% Robust free cash flow margin of 26.7% gives it many options for capital deployment, and its growing cash flow gives it even more resources to deploy\n\nMcDonald\u2019s stock price of $309.92 implies a valuation ratio of 23.5x forward P/E.

Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500\u2019s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one\u2019s looking - and paying a fraction of the price.

Here's the skinny on why Apple stock will be eclipsed by Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), with its $3.64 billion market cap, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), with its $3.53 trillion market cap, by year-end 2026 when it comes to total value.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nAlphabet's extending lead in AI\n\nAlphabet -- the parent company behind Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud -- recently set a new bar in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with the launch of the Gemini 3 chatbot. Gemini 3 crushes the benchmarks in AI capabilities across language queries, image generation, and deep research. Even though OpenAI's ChatGPT has more users, Gemini is the best chatbot out there today, according to third-party analysts.\n\nGemini is now powering AI overviews on Google search results, which management says already has 2 billion users every month. The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly active users (MAUs), making it one of the fastest-growing applications in the world, catching up to ChatGPT quickly. What's more, 70% of Google Cloud customers are utilizing Gemini, with 13 million developers building on the models. Not only can Alphabet monetize its AI capabilities through consumers, but by selling its capabilities through Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue is growing 34% year over year, and while we don't have figures around Gemini's revenue growth, it is likely growing much faster. Overall, Alphabet revenue is now growing 15% in constant currency, and with healthy profit margins. With no end in sight to the growing demand for AI, I expect Alphabet's revenue to keep growing at a double-digit rate over the next few years.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDiversified bets on AI infrastructure\n\nWhile Microsoft has lagged in developing consumer chatbots, it has perhaps been even better than Google Cloud at capturing AI contracts for its cloud computing division, Microsoft Azure.\n\nAzure has signed deals with AI start-ups competing with Google's Gemini, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, which come with huge sums of projected lifetime spending. For example, just this week, Anthropic cozied up to Azure and committed to buying $30 billion in credits on Azure. Last quarter, Azure revenue grew 39% year over year in constant currency, with overall cloud revenue up 27% to $30.9 billion, or run-rate revenues of $123.6 billion.\n\nMicrosoft has plenty going for it with its Office suite of products, too. This revenue segment, which also includes LinkedIn, grew revenue 14% year over year last quarter to $33 billion. At such a large scale, Microsoft is now seeing huge amounts of operating leverage, with operating income of $38 billion last quarter on $77.7 billion in revenue, or a margin of 49%.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nWhy both stocks will be worth more than Apple\n\nWhen comparing both Microsoft and Alphabet to Apple, there are two metrics that show why the former stocks are better positioned than the latter to be larger in 2026: growth and price.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet have grown much faster than Apple in recent history. Over the last three years, Microsoft's revenue has grown 44% and Alphabet's has grown 37% (cumulatively). Apple's is only up 7.4%.\n\nApple has failed to innovate and bring out successful new products, especially in the AI space, that can drive growth for the business. In fact, it is rumored that the struggling Siri chatbot will be utilizing Gemini in the future, which Apple will be paying Alphabet $1 billion a year for the privilege of.\n\nApple stock is also priced higher than Microsoft and Alphabet. Apple has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 compared to 34.5 for Microsoft and 29 for Alphabet. So not only is Apple growing slower than its Magnificent Seven peers, but doing so while trading at a higher valuation. I bet this paradigm flips in 2026, leading Microsoft and Alphabet to finish the year with larger market caps than Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company recently introduced NVQLink to connect quantum and classical computers. Nvidia is following a familiar pick-and-shovel strategy with quantum computing that has worked very well with AI. 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia \u203a\n\nBack in California's gold rush in the mid-1800s, thousands of individuals flocked to the region hoping to find gold and strike it rich. However, the easy money was instead made by the suppliers who sold tools to the gold prospectors.\n\nToday, the term \"pick-and-shovel investing\" honors that legacy. Oftentimes, providers of ancillary products and services achieve greater success than pure-play companies do.\n\nCould this be the case with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the quantum computing market? Maybe so. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nSimulation paves the way for reality\n\nSeveral companies are racing to develop large-scale quantum computers that can be utilized in a wide range of practical applications. They include tech giants such as Google Quantum AI parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) as well as rising stars like D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). However, Nvidia isn't in this group.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Nvidia doesn't have a vested interest in quantum computing, though. And the chipmaker doesn't have to wait for quantum computing to fulfill its potential to make money, either.\n\nResearchers must develop simulations of quantum systems to design and test algorithms and circuits. However, access to quantum processing units (QPUs) today is limited and expensive. Nvidia recognized this challenge and offers a solution: Use its graphics processing units (GPUs) on classical computers for quantum simulation.\n\nNvidia Quantum Cloud supports quantum simulation using the company's GPUs and its CUDA-Q quantum computing platform. Roughly 75% of organizations deploying QPUs use CUDA-Q.\n\nThree of the four largest cloud service providers have integrated Nvidia Quantum Cloud into their platforms: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) Cloud Infrastructure. The notable exception is Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, AWS allows QPU developers to use Nvidia's CUDA-Q.\n\nNvidia's bridge to the future\n\nNvidia's quantum opportunities aren't limited to simulation. The likelihood is that most practical quantum computers will be hybrid systems that connect QPUs with classical supercomputers for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe problem is that qubits (the basic units of information in quantum computers) are notoriously unwieldy, at least for now. Because they're prone to errors, complex calibration processes and control algorithms are required to keep them on track. Nvidia is addressing this challenge in two ways.\n\nFirst, the company's GPUs are ideally suited for powering the supercomputers needed in hybrid quantum-classical systems. Second, Nvidia has developed a low-latency, high-throughput bridge between QPUs and its GPUs called NVQLink.\n\nNvidia found and CEO Jensen Huang describes NVQLink as \"the Rosetta Stone connecting quantum and classical supercomputers.\" He recently predicted, \"In the near future, every Nvidia GPU scientific supercomputer will be hybrid, tightly coupled with quantum processors to expand what is possible with computing.\"\n\nA familiar path\n\nMaking money as a pick-and-shovel play in quantum computing should be relatively straightforward for Nvidia. The company has successfully navigated a similar path in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOpenAI, Google, and others have developed powerful large language models (LLMs). Many of these companies are also pioneering agentic AI and working on artificial general intelligence (AGI) and AI superintelligence (ASI). Nvidia opted not to compete on their turf. Instead, it's supporting them with the chips and software tools that make their jobs easier.\n\nIn many respects, Nvidia's strategy in quantum computing mirrors the approach it has taken with AI. With the company generating revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025 and projecting revenue of $65 billion next quarter, Nvidia's AI strategy is paying off handsomely. I think supplying the picks and shovels for the quantum computing gold rush will prove to be a winning approach over the long run, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

This is one of the most aggressive rounds of layoffs in the company's history.\n\nThat odd mix of record AI expenditure and big cutbacks is changing how your portfolio is exposed to Big Tech without you even noticing.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI makeover: Record spending, real people out\n\nMicrosoft seems to be unstoppable on the surface.\n\nThe company's Azure cloud business is expanding at a high rate of more than 10%. AI \"copilots\" are built into a variety of things, such as Office and GitHub. The stock is a major part of practically every large-cap index fund.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nInvestors hope good news from Nvidia gives the rally more life Palantir CEO Karp just settled major debate Spotify just solved a major problem for listeners Amazon lawsuit could be a warning to other employers\n\nThe firm is undertaking two things at once behind the scenes:\n\nAI spend surges: Company blog and filings reveal plans to pour $80 billion this fiscal year into AI-ready data centers. Headcount falls: A July memo confirmed over 15,000 layoffs in 2025, including 9,000 in a single month.\n\nSatya Nadella, the CEO, has said that the layoffs are \"weighing heavily\" on him. He has also made it plain that Microsoft is restructuring around AI, which implies that there will be more capital investment and fewer layers of personnel.\n\nThat doesn't make sense from a worker's point of view. Wall Street sees it as the new normal.AI spending reshapes the future of Big Tech operationsShutterstock\n\nThe new Big Tech model is revenue growth not headcount growth\n\nMicrosoft is merely the most obvious illustration of a bigger change.\n\nTech corporations in Silicon Valley are making more money than ever while secretly laying off workers. Over 141,000 IT jobs had been lost in 2025, according to a Washington Post research report that analyzed data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. This is a 17% increase over the same time last year. Over the previous two years, IT jobs have dropped by around 3% a year throughout the country and by over 19% in California.\n\nRelated: Palantir fans: You\u2019re not going to like what just happened\n\nWhy are the cutbacks still happening while AI sales are up through the roof? A few reasons keep popping up:\n\nStory Continues\n\nAI makes each worker more productive, so businesses don't have to recruit back as many people as they used to. The pandemic's \"growth at all costs\" mentality died when borrowing rates went up; boards now want efficiency. Investors like discipline, particularly when a firm can prove that its revenues are going up even when its number of employees is staying the same or going down.\n\nThat\u2019s the world Microsoft, and a lot of other tech giants, are in now. It\u2019s no longer just about beating the top line. It\u2019s about proving it can grow earnings while keeping payroll tight and redirecting cash into AI infrastructure instead.\n\nThe $300 billion AI bill hiding behind the layoffs\n\nThe human part of this is shown in pink slips. On the capex line, you can see the money side.\n\nAnalysts and data-center trackers currently estimate that the four U.S. hyperscalers, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, will spend more than $300 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, primarily for AI-driven data centers and networking, according to CNBC.\n\nRelated: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S26 makes big bet on thin phones, in-house chips\n\nIn a general sense:\n\nMicrosoft plans to spend around $80 billion on AI-focused data centers and cloud infrastructure in fiscal year 2025. Amazon's capital expenditures are estimated to be above $100 billion in 2025. CFO Brian Olsavsky says a significant portion of this money is for AWS and AI. Alphabet boosted its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $91 billion to $93 billion as it pushes to construct AI infrastructure for Search, YouTube, and the cloud.\n\nFor earnings, the trade looks like this:\n\nRight present, layoffs are cutting operational costs since wages and benefits are leaving SG&A and R&D. AI infrastructure shows up as capital expenditures that lose value over time, which means they don't have a big effect on earnings right away. Investors profit if the AI gamble pays off by bringing in more money, greater automation, and higher margins. Shareholders will have to pay for a highly costly weapons race that also costs thousands of people their jobs if it doesn't. Nvidia and other chipmakers are on the opposite side of that deal. Every time Microsoft and other companies fire a team and buy additional GPUs, the \"AI arms dealers\" that sell that technology become a greater part of your portfolio narrative.\n\nFor earnings, the trade looks like this:\n\nAs salary and benefits leave SG&A and R&D, layoffs lower operational costs. AI infrastructure investment depreciates over years, minimizing earnings effect.\n\nIf the AI investment yields more money for AI, leads to greater automation, and results in higher margins, investors benefit. Shareholders will pay for a highly costly weapons race that also costs thousands of people their jobs if it doesn't.\n\nRelated: The $1 billion bet: how Nokia stake fits Nvidia's AI roadmap\n\nNvidia and other chipmakers are on the opposite side of that deal. Every time Microsoft and other companies fire a team and buy additional GPUs, the \"AI arms dealers\" that sell that technology become a greater part of your portfolio narrative.\n\nHow this quiet reset hits your index funds\n\nYou don't have to own Microsoft to be at risk.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the biggest companies in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon are close behind it. You have wagered that their AI-heavy, lean-headcount plan will work if you hold a wide index fund.\n\nRelated: Is Nvidia\u2019s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn\u2019t think so\n\nFor now, Wall Street loves this because:\n\nMore people are working for the company, but revenue is expanding faster than that. In a harder rate environment, cost reduction, simpler org charts, and AI solutions assist protect operational profits. Big AI capital expenditures make it hard for smaller competitors to climb over the moat.\n\nBut it also means your retirement plan is increasingly vulnerable to one fundamental question: Is the AI reward worth the cost in terms of money and people?\n\nFour numbers that tell you if the AI bet is working\n\nYou don't need a spreadsheet full of calculations to see whether Microsoft's AI shift (and the ones that replicate it) is really benefiting you. These four lines from each earnings report reveal much of the story:\n\nRevenue per employee: Rising output with flat or lower headcount signals real AI-driven efficiency. AI capex as % of revenue: A higher ratio shows the company is committing to AI infrastructure. Operating margin trend: Margins must improve despite big AI spending and layoffs. Share count + capital returns: Buybacks and dividends indicate cash flows are strengthening, not just shifting on paper.\n\nYou can get all of this information from Microsoft's filings and investor presentations. The same criteria works for Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Apple.\n\nThe AI bet you already own whether you like it or not\n\nThe new formula from Microsoft is simple: more GPUs and fewer humans.\n\nYou may not have known it, but if you have an S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 fund, you've already voted for that formula. Your money is helping to pay for a $80 billion AI build-out at the same corporation that recently fired more than 15,000 workers.\n\nRelated: Why Nvidia\u2019s 'big sellers' might secretly be its biggest believers\n\nYou don't have to like that trade-off. But you should be able to see it plainly.\n\nFor individual investors in the AI age, the key question isn't simply what Microsoft will make next. When you look at your next quarterly statement and decide whether you still want to own the AI experiment you're in, you have to ask yourself if exchanging bodies for data centers really seems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Nov 23, 2025, where it first appeared in the Economy section.

Its Robotaxi business is finally beginning to roll out in a few markets, but its autonomous Cybercab is not in production. Tesla\u2019s valuation is astronomically high.These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) form an elite group of companies known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" due to their industry leadership and market influence.\n\nAs many of these companies continue to deliver market-beating returns, the Magnificent Seven now comprise a remarkable 35% of the value of the S&P 500.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nIn a series of articles, I'll be ranking each of these stocks and discussing why some are still chock-full of untapped potential, while others should be avoided by investors.\n\nHere's why Tesla is my least favorite of the bunch to buy in 2026.\n\nImage source: Tesla.\n\nTesla's core business growth is slowing\n\nIf Tesla can effectively monetize some of its larger bets, such as its planned Robotaxi network, its humanoid robots, or its other artificial intelligence (AI) endeavors, it could easily be the single best Magnificent Seven stock to buy and hold for the next five to 10 years.\n\nBut that's a big \"if.\"\n\nThe major difference between Tesla and the other Magnificent Seven companies is that its core business is struggling.\n\nBy comparison, revenue growth remains strong for Apple's iPhone and services categories. Amazon Web Services generates gobs of free cash flow that funds the company's other ambitions. Alphabet and Microsoft each generate sizable earnings from a variety of digital segments, including cloud computing infrastructure, where they're both major players. Meta Platforms has its highly profitable \"family of apps\" segment, which brings in more than enough to support its billions of dollars in losses from Reality Labs, which contains its metaverse-related operations. And Nvidia's compute and networking segment continues to deliver jaw-dropping results, while its smaller segments are also highly profitable.\n\nBy contrast, Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) deliveries were trending downward in the first half of 2025, though it remains the market leader. Its energy storage business is on firmer footing, but it makes up a small part of the top line. In the third quarter, Tesla grew automotive revenue just 6% year over year as deliveries rebounded, up 7%. However, the company's operating margin fell to just 5.8% -- a steep decline from 10.8% a year earlier.\n\nTesla is spending a ton of money on artificial intelligence and robotics, but it has yet to see a payoff from those investments.\n\nThis past summer, Tesla launched its autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and it has since expanded it to a few other markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area. However, it remains to be seen how profitable it will be at scale.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, so far, that service is being provided by standard Model Y EVs that have been outfitted with Tesla's Robotaxi technology, not the much-discussed Cybercab, which is not yet in production. And in most markets, regulators are still requiring human monitors for those autonomous vehicles.\n\nThere are better buys than Tesla for 2026\n\nTesla's Robotaxis feature pioneering-edge AI, which presents distinct challenges compared to embedding AI within smartphones or personal computers, so the company deserves credit for making progress in that field.\n\nHowever, the risks of investing in Tesla simply aren't worth the potential rewards at this time, especially given the fact the stock is trading at 178 times expected 2026 earnings.\n\nSince Tesla's valuation appears to be increasingly disconnected from its core EV business and based more on the potential of new ventures that have yet to prove themselves, investors may want to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the stock at this time. There are many other compelling buys in big tech.\n\nStay tuned to find out how the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks stack up in my rankings for 2026.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's My No. 7 Pick.", "content": "Key Points\n\nTesla lacks one key quality that the other \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies all possess. Its Robotaxi business is finally beginning to roll out in a few markets, but its autonomous Cybercab is not in production. Tesla\u2019s valuation is astronomically high. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) form an elite group of companies known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" due to their industry leadership and market influence.\n\nAs many of these companies continue to deliver market-beating returns, the Magnificent Seven now comprise a remarkable 35% of the value of the S&P 500.\n\nIn a series of articles, I'll be ranking each of these stocks and discussing why some are still chock-full of untapped potential, while others should be avoided by investors.\n\nHere's why Tesla is my least favorite of the bunch to buy in 2026.Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla's core business growth is slowing\n\nIf Tesla can effectively monetize some of its larger bets, such as its planned Robotaxi network, its humanoid robots, or its other artificial intelligence (AI) endeavors, it could easily be the single best Magnificent Seven stock to buy and hold for the next five to 10 years.\n\nBut that's a big \"if.\"\n\nThe major difference between Tesla and the other Magnificent Seven companies is that its core business is struggling.\n\nBy comparison, revenue growth remains strong for Apple's iPhone and services categories. Amazon Web Services generates gobs of free cash flow that funds the company's other ambitions. Alphabet and Microsoft each generate sizable earnings from a variety of digital segments, including cloud computing infrastructure, where they're both major players. Meta Platforms has its highly profitable \"family of apps\" segment, which brings in more than enough to support its billions of dollars in losses from Reality Labs, which contains its metaverse-related operations. And Nvidia's compute and networking segment continues to deliver jaw-dropping results, while its smaller segments are also highly profitable.\n\nBy contrast, Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) deliveries were trending downward in the first half of 2025, though it remains the market leader. Its energy storage business is on firmer footing, but it makes up a small part of the top line. In the third quarter, Tesla grew automotive revenue just 6% year over year as deliveries rebounded, up 7%. However, the company's operating margin fell to just 5.8% -- a steep decline from 10.8% a year earlier.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTesla is spending a ton of money on artificial intelligence and robotics, but it has yet to see a payoff from those investments.\n\nThis past summer, Tesla launched its autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and it has since expanded it to a few other markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area. However, it remains to be seen how profitable it will be at scale.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, so far, that service is being provided by standard Model Y EVs that have been outfitted with Tesla's Robotaxi technology, not the much-discussed Cybercab, which is not yet in production. And in most markets, regulators are still requiring human monitors for those autonomous vehicles.\n\nThere are better buys than Tesla for 2026\n\nTesla's Robotaxis feature pioneering-edge AI, which presents distinct challenges compared to embedding AI within smartphones or personal computers, so the company deserves credit for making progress in that field.\n\nHowever, the risks of investing in Tesla simply aren't worth the potential rewards at this time, especially given the fact the stock is trading at 178 times expected 2026 earnings.\n\nSince Tesla's valuation appears to be increasingly disconnected from its core EV business and based more on the potential of new ventures that have yet to prove themselves, investors may want to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the stock at this time. There are many other compelling buys in big tech.\n\nStay tuned to find out how the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks stack up in my rankings for 2026.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It's hardly a list, as it's composed of just one company, Nvidia.\n\nHowever, several others aren't too far behind. One of them is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google, which has a current market cap of $3.4 trillion.

See the stocks \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet isn't the corporation closest to the $5 trillion mark. Other than Nvidia, which has already achieved that milestone but is currently worth less than that, Microsoft and Apple are both ahead. The former has a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion, while the latter is valued at $3.9 trillion.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning Amazon, which is currently trailing at $2.4 trillion. However, it may be able to catch up, provided it gains significant market value while its peers decline over the next couple of years.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe Alphabet could perform at least as well as Amazon for the foreseeable future. Both are leaders in the cloud computing market. Amazon has a larger market share, but Alphabet is growing sales in that division more quickly.\n\nThe rest of their businesses put Alphabet squarely in the lead for one reason -- margins.\n\nAMZN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon generates higher sales, but Alphabet has higher profits and higher margins. Meanwhile, Alphabet still reigns supreme in search, despite challenges from artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.\n\nThe company has made changes to address this issue, including an AI overview and an AI mode within its renowned search engine. Furthermore, Alphabet eliminated a major risk this year and avoided the worst outcome -- that of losing its Chrome browser, a crucial part of its advertising empire -- in its antitrust lawsuit. In my view, Alphabet has enough momentum to stay ahead of Amazon in the next couple of years.\n\nWhat about Apple? Despite the iPhone maker's recent better-than-expected financial results, it's still facing significant threats.\n\nThe tariff situation is constantly evolving, and more news on that front could negatively impact Apple's stock price, as it still manufactures most of its products in China, a country President Trump has targeted with tariffs. Alphabet is also already cashing in on its AI strategy, whereas Apple has been lagging behind its similarly sized tech peers.\n\nAlphabet's AI offerings through its cloud division, including its AI overviews and AI mode, as well as algorithms that increase engagement on YouTube -- leading to higher ad revenue -- are all important tailwinds for the company. So Alphabet could perform much better than Apple and beat the iPhone maker to a $5 trillion valuation.\n\nWhat about Microsoft? Both companies are thriving in the cloud and AI spaces. Microsoft arguably has an edge over Alphabet in both. However, Alphabet appears more reasonably valued when considering traditional valuation metrics.\n\nGOOG Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nThat's one reason Alphabet could overtake even Microsoft to become the next $5 trillion company.\n\nThe more important question\n\nOf course, outcomes are always hard to predict. A lot could happen in the next 12 months (or so) that would disrupt Alphabet's path to a $5 trillion market cap, and one of its peers could get there before.\n\nWill Alphabet perform well enough in the next couple of years to be the next company to reach this goal? That's less important than determining whether the stock is worth holding for long-term investors, regardless of what happens in the short term. In that department, Alphabet looks like a great pick. It's a leader in several industries, boasting massive growth prospects in digital advertising, cloud computing, AI, and streaming.\n\nThe tech giant also has a hand in innovative and potentially disruptive new sectors, such as self-driving vehicles. Further, Alphabet benefits from a strong competitive advantage, thanks to its brand name, switching costs in cloud computing, and network effects in internet search.\n\nAfter eliminating a major antitrust threat, the company's prospects look stronger than ever. All things considered, Alphabet appears to be a buy, even if it doesn't become the next $5 trillion company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

The highly profitable tech giant is positioned to benefit from multiple secular tailwinds. Alphabet is also one of the cheapest stocks to own among big tech companies. 10 stocks we like better than Alphabet \u203a\n\nOver the past three years, institutional and retail investors have poured record sums into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. In particular, a small collective known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- comprised of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- are among the most closely held stocks across the entire S&P 500.\n\nOne notable investor who stayed on the sidelines throughout the AI revolution, however, is Warren Buffett. Over the last few years, Buffett's investment conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, was stockpiling record levels of cash while everyone else raced to buy more technology stocks.BRK.B Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThese dynamics are beginning to shift. According to Berkshire's latest 13F filing, the investment firm bought 17.8 million shares of Alphabet during the third quarter -- a stake that is now worth about $4.3 billion. Notably, Alphabet was the only stock Berkshire purchased in the third quarter.\n\nLet's break down Buffett's investment philosophy and explore how Alphabet fits into that equation. From there, I'll take a look at Alphabet's valuation metrics to help determine if now is a good time to follow Buffett's lead.\n\nWhat types of stocks does Warren Buffett like to buy?\n\nIf you want to learn how to invest like Warren Buffett, you're in luck. While the Oracle of Omaha ranks among the world's wealthiest people, Buffett's approach to investing is quite simple.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio does not feature speculative companies involved in volatile industries. Instead, Buffett seeks out durability. Against this backdrop, it's not surprising that companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Chevron are some of Buffett's largest positions.\n\nEach of these is considered a blue chip company that produces steady, predictable cash flow. Moreover, these businesses often reinvest their profits into shareholder rewards programs such as dividends or stock buybacks.\n\nIn essence, Buffett pounces on businesses with best-in-class brand recognition that sell products that people need in their daily lives. Given these dynamics, many of the positions in Berkshire's portfolio could be seen as stocks that long-term investors can own forever.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAlphabet meets Buffett's checklist\n\nAlphabet checks off many of Buffett's boxes. The company owns two of the most recognizable brands on the planet: internet search platform Google and video-sharing website YouTube.\n\nGiven the level of internet surface area that Alphabet covers, it's obvious why advertisers are eager to capitalize on the engagement the company generates. This gives Alphabet enormous leverage in the form of pricing power, which directly translates into a steady, highly profitable operation.\n\nBeyond advertising, Alphabet has also built a thriving cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Underneath this umbrella sits a custom hardware offering, called tensor processing units (TPUs). Layering cloud software with custom silicon gives Alphabet a direct line into the semiconductor industry -- enabling it to take on incumbents like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nLastly, Alphabet also has a large consumer electronics business in Android -- which competes with Apple -- and is also taking on Tesla in the world of autonomous driving through its subsidiary, Waymo.\n\nAlphabet's diverse ecosystem provides the company with an enviable degree of flexibility -- a form of malleability that positions it to pivot and grow during virtually any economic cycle or emerging technology trend. In turn, the company is consistently profitable, which Alphabet uses to reinvest in innovation as well as reward shareholders through a modest dividend program.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA Buffett masterclass: Finding value in a sea of growth\n\nIn my view, it's unlikely that Buffett decided to initiate a position in Alphabet purely based on the AI narrative. Berkshire's portfolio has always featured a limited number of technology businesses.\n\nHowever, among the tech stocks that Buffett has chosen, a common theme arises. In addition to Apple, Berkshire also has positions in Amazon and now Alphabet. Each of these companies has built diversified ecosystems across software, hardware, and consumer services.GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28, Alphabet stock is no longer trading at a bargain. While paying a premium is uncharacteristic of Buffett, Alphabet is still the second-cheapest stock among the Magnificent Seven -- suggesting investors may not be fully pricing in the company's next growth phase.\n\nIn my eyes, Buffett is still sticking to his playbook -- identifying relative value in an otherwise frothy market. Furthermore, I think the timing of Berkshire's purchase of Alphabet stock is telling. In other words, if Buffett and his constituents felt that AI was a fad or a bubble, then Berkshire would not have bought Alphabet stock.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, I think Alphabet remains an attractive opportunity given its proven durability and compelling long-term potential -- with or without AI playing a role in the thesis.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Notably, Alphabet was the only stock Berkshire purchased in the third quarter.\n\nLet's break down Buffett's investment philosophy and explore how Alphabet fits into that equation. From there, I'll take a look at Alphabet's valuation metrics to help determine if now is a good time to follow Buffett's lead.\n\nWhat types of stocks does Warren Buffett like to buy?\n\nIf you want to learn how to invest like Warren Buffett, you're in luck. While the Oracle of Omaha ranks among the world's wealthiest people, Buffett's approach to investing is quite simple.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio does not feature speculative companies involved in volatile industries. Instead, Buffett seeks out durability. Against this backdrop, it's not surprising that companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Chevron are some of Buffett's largest positions.\n\nEach of these is considered a blue chip company that produces steady, predictable cash flow. Moreover, these businesses often reinvest their profits into shareholder rewards programs such as dividends or stock buybacks.\n\nIn essence, Buffett pounces on businesses with best-in-class brand recognition that sell products that people need in their daily lives. Given these dynamics, many of the positions in Berkshire's portfolio could be seen as stocks that long-term investors can own forever.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAlphabet meets Buffett's checklist\n\nAlphabet checks off many of Buffett's boxes. The company owns two of the most recognizable brands on the planet: internet search platform Google and video-sharing website YouTube.\n\nGiven the level of internet surface area that Alphabet covers, it's obvious why advertisers are eager to capitalize on the engagement the company generates. This gives Alphabet enormous leverage in the form of pricing power, which directly translates into a steady, highly profitable operation.\n\nBeyond advertising, Alphabet has also built a thriving cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Underneath this umbrella sits a custom hardware offering, called tensor processing units (TPUs). Layering cloud software with custom silicon gives Alphabet a direct line into the semiconductor industry -- enabling it to take on incumbents like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nLastly, Alphabet also has a large consumer electronics business in Android -- which competes with Apple -- and is also taking on Tesla in the world of autonomous driving through its subsidiary, Waymo.\n\nAlphabet's diverse ecosystem provides the company with an enviable degree of flexibility -- a form of malleability that positions it to pivot and grow during virtually any economic cycle or emerging technology trend. In turn, the company is consistently profitable, which Alphabet uses to reinvest in innovation as well as reward shareholders through a modest dividend program.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA Buffett masterclass: Finding value in a sea of growth\n\nIn my view, it's unlikely that Buffett decided to initiate a position in Alphabet purely based on the AI narrative. Berkshire's portfolio has always featured a limited number of technology businesses.\n\nHowever, among the tech stocks that Buffett has chosen, a common theme arises. In addition to Apple, Berkshire also has positions in Amazon and now Alphabet. Each of these companies has built diversified ecosystems across software, hardware, and consumer services.\n\nGOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28, Alphabet stock is no longer trading at a bargain. While paying a premium is uncharacteristic of Buffett, Alphabet is still the second-cheapest stock among the Magnificent Seven -- suggesting investors may not be fully pricing in the company's next growth phase.\n\nIn my eyes, Buffett is still sticking to his playbook -- identifying relative value in an otherwise frothy market. Furthermore, I think the timing of Berkshire's purchase of Alphabet stock is telling. In other words, if Buffett and his constituents felt that AI was a fad or a bubble, then Berkshire would not have bought Alphabet stock.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, I think Alphabet remains an attractive opportunity given its proven durability and compelling long-term potential -- with or without AI playing a role in the thesis.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.
