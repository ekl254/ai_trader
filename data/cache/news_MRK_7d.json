There appears to be a tug-of-war now between the AI bubble bears and the AI/Hyperscaler bulls who say the foundation for huge technological change is upon us. With the potential for a December rate cut back on the table, that could fuel an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nPre-Market Stock Futures:\n\nThe shortened holiday week is here, and the futures are trading higher this morning. Most traders and investors are returning with a severe case of whiplash after the stock market posted some of the wildest swings we have seen this year last week. Skyrocketing after the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings and then plunging. An attempt on Thursday to follow through fell apart before noon, and stocks ended in the red. Friday offered the promise of a rally after New York Fed President John Williams said more rate cuts were possible. That fizzled by mid-morning, only to reverse again in the afternoon, ending Friday with all the major indices substantially higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last seen on Friday at 46,245, up 1.08%; the S&P 500 closed at 6602, up 0.98%; and the NASDAQ, which took the biggest shots last week, at 22,273, up 0.88%. With attendance on Wall Street likely to slow by Wednesday, look for a break in the recent extreme volatility.\n\nTreasury Bonds:\n\nYields were lower across the curve on Friday as buyers returned to take advantage of earlier-week selling. Needless to say, the comments from the New York Fed President boosted the potential for a December 25 basis-point cut, which would bring the Fed funds rate to 3.50%-3.75%, in turn spurring Friday's positive trading. The 30-year-long bond closed the session at 4.72% while the benchmark 10-year note finished the day at 4.07%.\n\nOil and Gas:\n\nThe oil energy complex once again took it in the chin on Friday as both of the major benchmarks finished the day lower. The impetus behind the selling was again attributed to the potential settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war, in which President Trump told President Zelensky of Ukraine he wanted an answer on his peace proposal by Thanksgiving Day. Brent Crude closed trading Friday at $62.49, down 1.4% while West Texas Intermediate was last seen down 1.69% at $58, the lowest close for the Texas Tea since last May. Natural gas was the only winner Friday, finishing up 2.19% at $4.57. With prospects for a cold winter and rising electricity demand, investors need to look at the top stocks in the sector now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGold:\n\nGold was flat on Friday, closing modestly lower at $4,064. While the bullion churned back and forth all last week, the critical $4,000 support level appears to be holding. As we reported last week, the UBS team sees the potential for Gold to reach $4,900 as early as the first quarter of 2026.\n\nCrypto:\n\nThe crypto market experienced a sharp downturn early on Friday, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) slumping to multi-month lows. This was part of a broader \"flight from risk\" as investors moved away from riskier assets amid concerns over tech stock valuations and U.S. interest rate uncertainty. Friday's stock market reversal helped stem some of the damage, with Bitcoin trading at $83,750 at 4 PM EST and Ethereum at $2,741. Please keep in mind that cryptocurrencies trade 24/7/365.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Building on its leadership in oncology, the company has a broad clinical development program that evaluates novel mechanisms of action to address longstanding unmet needs for patients with hematologic neoplasms and malignancies. Among Merck\u2019s research efforts are studies evaluating multiple investigational medicines as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies across a range of hematologic neoplasms and malignancies.\n\nAbout MK-1045\n\nMK-1045 (previously CN201) is a novel, investigational CD19xCD3 T-cell engager, designed to redirect T-cells to specifically deplete malignant or pathogenic B cells. It is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 trial for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NCT06189391) and in a Phase 1b/2 trial for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (NCT05579132).\n\nAbout bomedemstat (MK-3543)\n\nBomedemstat (MK-3543) is an investigational, orally available small molecule that inhibits lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), an enzyme that is potentially important for regulating the rapid reproduction of blood stem cells and the maturation of blood cells in the bone marrow. Bomedemstat is being studied across myeloproliferative neoplasms, including essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Two Phase 3 trials are ongoing: Shorespan-006 (NCT06079879), an open-label study comparing bomedemstat to best available therapy in patients with essential thrombocythemia who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, and Shorespan-007 (NCT06456346), a double-blind study evaluating bomedemstat versus hydroxyurea in patients with essential thrombocythemia who have not previously received cytoreductive therapy.\n\nAbout nemtabrutinib (MK-1026)\n\nNemtabrutinib is an investigational oral, reversible, non-covalent BTK inhibitor that suppresses oncogenic B-cell receptor signaling with activity against wild-type BTK and BTK pathway mutants. Nemtabrutinib aims to address a common mechanism of resistance with currently available covalent, BTK inhibitors by binding in an alternative way to the BTK protein. Merck is advancing research with nemtabrutinib across B-cell malignancies through its BELLWAVE clinical program. Two Phase 3 trials are ongoing: BELLWAVE-008 (NCT05624554), comparing nemtabrutinib to chemoimmunotherapy in previously untreated CLL/SLL without TP53 aberrations, and BELLWAVE-011 (NCT06136559), evaluating nemtabrutinib versus investigator\u2019s choice of BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib) in previously untreated CLL/SLL.\n\nAbout zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140)\n\nZilovertamab vedotin is an investigational ADC that targets ROR1. ROR1 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in multiple hematologic malignancies. Merck is committed to research with zilovertamab vedotin across B-cell malignancies and has established a robust program of clinical trials under the name waveLINE. The waveLINE program includes a Phase 3 study in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL (waveLINE-003, NCT05139017), a Phase 3 study in patients with previously untreated DLBCL (waveLINE-010, NCT06717347), a Phase 2 study in patients with select B-cell lymphomas (waveLINE-006, NCT05458297), a Phase 2 study in patients with germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL (waveLINE-011, NCT06890884) and a Phase 2 study in patients with previously untreated DLBCL (waveLINE-007, NCT05406401).\n\nAbout Merck\n\nAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

Nearly half of patients experience recurrence even after surgery, and many are unable to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy, leaving a significant unmet need.\n\nMerck's blockbuster cancer drug KEYTRUDA, which contains the active ingredient pembrolizumab, is administered intravenously, while KEYTRUDA QLEX, which is a fixed-dose combination of pembrolizumab plus berahyaluronidase alfa, is administered as a subcutaneous injection. KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nKEYTRUDA QLEX was approved as recently as September of this year. Padcev, co-developed by Astellas and Seattle Genetics, now a part of Pfizer, is an antibody-drug conjugate approved for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer and urothelial cancer.\n\nThe FDA approval was supported by results from a phase 3 trial, which tested Keytruda, alone or together with Padcev, given around the time of surgery (perioperative), in people with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who are cisplatin-ineligible or who decline cisplatin, dubbed KEYNOTE-905.\n\nAfter a median follow-up of 25.6 months, perioperative KEYTRUDA plus Padcev reduced the risk of event-free survival events by 60% compared to surgery alone. The regimen also demonstrated a 50% improvement in overall survival and achieved a pathologic complete response rate of 57.1% versus 8.6% with surgery alone.\n\nSafety data indicated that adverse reactions were observed in at least 20% of patients during treatment. Serious immune-mediated adverse events such as pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis were also observed, consistent with the known safety profile of PD-1 inhibitors.\n\n\"This approval represents the first PD-1 inhibitor plus ADC regimen for this patient population and may be practice-changing for patients who previously had only surgery as an option,\" said Dr. Matthew Galsky, study investigator at Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Center.\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX will be available in the U.S. for eligible bladder cancer patients following this approval.\n\nThe approval represents the first and only antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and PD-1 inhibitor regimen for this patient population and a potential new standard of care.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, KEYTRUDA generated $8.1 billion in sales, reflecting a 10% year-over-year increase.\n\nMRK has traded in the range of $73.31 to $105.07 over the past year.

Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

That way, I won\u2019t have to worry about financial stability and can improve my total return, as stock market weakness usually causes dividends to become a much bigger driver of total returns. \n\nIn addition to undervalued players in healthcare and consumer staples like Merck (MRK [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK]), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ]), and PepsiCo (PEP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP]), I like the REIT and midstream space, which are the two best examples of predictable cash flows.\n\nSafe net lease players like Realty Income (O [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O]), NNN REIT (NNN [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NNN]), and Essential Properties Trust (EPRT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPRT]) should do especially well on a relative basis. In midstream, I like ONEOK (OKE [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE]), Antero Midstream (AM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AM]), Kinder Morgan (KMI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMI]), and Canadian players like TC Energy (TRP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRP]) and Enbridge (ENB [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENB]). All of these companies are C-Corps. In the MLP space, I prefer Western Midstream (WES [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WES]) and MPLX (MPLX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPLX]) over everyone else.\n\nRoberts Berzins [https://seekingalpha.com/author/roberts-berzins-cfa]: Given the record highs of largest indices (SPY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY]) (QQQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ]) and the overall excitement about the potential productivity gains from the AI, it would be only prudent to add a bit of defense in the portfolio.\n\nBy defense I mean concrete picks, which are uncorrelated to the AI stocks, like high-quality, long-duration REITs, such as in the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (VNQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ]). The premise here is that if the AI-concentrated market starts to plunge, the long-term Treasury yields should go up. And if the economy fell into recession, odds would be high that the Fed would embark on quantitative easing, which is also positive for Treasury yields.\n\nFor REITs like Realty Income (O [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O]), this is exactly what is needed to drive up valuations, given the inherently high-duration factors that stem from long-term, relatively fixed leases. Plus, by deploying capital into O, investors would be able to access an attractive dividend yield of 5.6% that is underpinned by an upper investment grade balance sheet and cash flows that are desynchronized from the AI play.\n\nMORE ON SPDR S&P 500 ETF TRUST, INVESCO QQQ TRUST ETF, ETC.\n\n \t* The AI Bubble Hangover: Distinguishing The Revolution From The Ruin [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846299-the-ai-bubble-hangover-distinguishing-the-revolution-from-the-ruin]\n \t* The Tardy September Jobs Report Shows Overall Weakness [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846276-the-tardy-september-jobs-report-shows-overall-weakness]\n \t* Cracks Are Developing In The 'Everything' Bubble [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846260-cracks-developing-in-the-everything-bubble]\n \t* Wall Street's slide likely driven by signals in crypto - Fundstrat's Lee, IBKR's Sosnick [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524686-wall-streets-slide-likely-driven-by-signals-in-crypto---fundstrats-lee-ibkrs-sosnick]\n \t* Volatility spikes to a one month high as market sentiment shifts sour [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524592-volatility-spikes-to-a-one-month-high-as-market-sentiment-shifts-sour]\n\n ", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524699-sa-what-are-the-best-defensive-stocks-right-now?utm_source=feed_news_all&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;feed_item_type=news", "symbols": ["AM.US", "ENB.US", "EPRT.US", "JNJ.US", "KMI.US", "MPLX.US", "MRK.US", "NNN.US", "O.US", "OKE.US", "PEP.US"], "tags": ["BALANCE SHEET", "CONSUMER", "CONSUMER-STAPLES", "CONSUMER\u00a0", "DEFENSIVE-STOCKS", "DIVIDENDS", "ENERGY\u00a0", "FINANCIALS", "FINANCIALS\u00a0", "HEALTHCARE\u00a0", "MIDSTREAM", "REITS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.037, "neu": 0.812, "pos": 0.151}}, {"date": "2025-11-23T12:01:58+00:00", "title": "Analysts Shift to Hold as Cidara\u2019s (CDTX) Recent Acquisition Deal Caps Upside", "content": "Cidara Therapeutics Inc.

(NYSE:MRK), Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez downgraded his rating on Cidara Therapeutics from Buy to Neutral on November 17, according to TheFly. Before the deal, Fernandez had assigned a price target of $167, but after the downgrade, he raised it to the offer price of $221.5.\n\nBillion Photos/Shutterstock.com\n\nOn November 14, Merck announced the acquisition of Cidara Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:CDTX) in an all-cash deal at $221.5 per share, valuing the transaction at $9.2 billion. The offer price represented a 109% premium over the November 13 closing price of $105.99. Under the deal\u2019s terms, a Merck subsidiary will acquire all of Cidara\u2019s outstanding shares through a tender offer and is expected to close the deal in the first quarter of 2026, after receiving required approvals.\n\nWith this deal, Merck plans to expand its infectious disease portfolio with Cidara\u2019s lead drug-Fc conjugates (DFC) candidate, CD388, a late-stage, long-acting antiviral designed to prevent influenza in people at high risk of complications. CD388 is currently in Phase 3 (ANCHOR Study) and has held Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations following positive Phase 2b results.\n\nAccording to reports, this addition should help Merck offset revenue declines from upcoming patent expirations of its key drug, Keytruda. Underpinning the importance of this deal, Merck CEO Rob Davis noted that CD388 is an \u201cimportant driver of growth through the next decade.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the announcement, Cidara Therapeutics Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:CDTX) stock rallied by over 105% to close near the offer price. With that, the stock has rallied 717% year to date.\n\nApart from Guggenheim, analysts, including those from H.C. Wainwright, JPMorgan, and RBC Capital, also downgraded the stock to Hold. Morgan Stanley analyst Maxwell Skor expects the deal to sail through as per plans, and thus downgraded the stock to Equal Weight, raising his price target to the offer price of $221.5.\n\nCidara Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:CDTX) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. It develops anti-infectives for the treatment and prevention of fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CDTX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Here\u2019s why.", "content": "Medicare Part B premiums are going up by 9.7% in 2026. - Getty Images\n\nBlame medical inflation and more people in need of costly care for the 9.7% jump in Medicare Part B premiums next year.\n\nStarting in January, people on Medicare will pay $202.90 in 2026 for their monthly Part B premiums, which provide coverage for services like doctor\u2019s visits, outpatient procedures and medications administered by a healthcare professional. That\u2019s up from $185.00 in 2025.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of tension\u2019: My brother and I manage a $5 million trust. How do we solve our many disagreements? Why trouble for the biggest foreign buyer of U.S. debt could ripple through America\u2019s bond market Watch out: Bitcoin isn\u2019t what you think it is\n\nThe government has a simple explanation for the largest-ever dollar increase for these premiums, citing \u201cprojected growth in overall healthcare spending.\u201d Medicare\u2019s spending growth is supposed to increase 8.9% across 2026 and 2027, outpacing the 5.6% jump in predicted health spending growth in general.\n\nPhysician-administered drugs like Merck\u2019s MRK cancer medication Keytruda and Regeneron\u2019s REGN Eylea treatment for age-related eye diseases make up the biggest chunk of Medicare Part B spending \u2014 though a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) spokesperson said \u201ccost fluctuations for individual drugs\u201d weren\u2019t \u201csignificant enough\u201d to be a major cost driver for premiums in 2026.\n\nWhy is healthcare spending going up?\n\nThe CMS decides how to set Part B premiums using a calculation that assesses projected spending and the status of the Medicare trust, which is funded by revenue and premiums, to finance Medicare spending. But sometimes the calculation can take into account the previous year\u2019s spending if it was higher than expected, according to Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow in economic studies for the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center on Health Policy.\n\nThere are a range of factors that can influence spending for Medicare in any given year, like expensive new drugs for diseases affecting millions of people or higher costs of managed care as more people choose Medicare Advantage.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re seeing the inflation in the medical sector,\u201d said Julie Carter, counsel for federal policy at the Medicare Rights Center, referring to the CMS. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot driving up medical costs.\u201d\n\nThe CMS predicts that the fastest-growing categories for all of Medicare in 2026 are managed care, which means Medicare Advantage, and outpatient hospital services.\n\nAt the same time, people are living longer, tend to need more costly care and are using the system to get it. (People underused their healthcare during the pandemic, and some experts like Fiedler believe some are still catching up on missed or delayed care.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nPlus, more care is moving from inpatient settings to less expensive outpatient facilities. Part B, however, only includes spending on outpatient services.\n\nWill my Part B premium go up a lot in the future too?\n\nPart B premiums will likely increase again in 2027, possibly by 6% to 7%. Back in June, Medicare predicted that Part B premiums will increase again in 2027, to $218.60. That\u2019s up 7.7% from the current cost of $202.90. It\u2019s also a 5.8% increase compared to the earlier projection that Part B premiums for 2026 would be $206.50.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s two schools of thought about what premium costs may look like over the next few years. Healthcare costs in general are rising, and hospitals may raise prices if more people, including those younger than age 65, go without health insurance and end up getting care they can\u2019t pay for, according to Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Program on Medicare Policy. This would likely lead the CMS to raise the price of premiums.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that premiums will continue to increase without additional efforts to slow the growth in Part B spending,\u201d she said. \u201cThe number of people on Medicare is rising. There has been, and continues to be, a shift from inpatient to outpatient services.\u201d\n\nBut there are also a few events that could stem Part B growth in the near term. Starting next year, costs are set to go down for Medicare Part D since the government negotiated prices for 10 drugs, and that\u2019s projected to lower costs for Medicare as a whole by $6 billion. Then, in 2028, the first batch of negotiated prices for some Part B drugs is set to go into effect.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the fact that premiums went up a lot this year is necessarily an indicator that that\u2019s going to continue,\u201d Fiedler said.\n\nWill my premiums ever go down?\n\nIt\u2019s rare, but it\u2019s happened.\n\nBack in 2021, the CMS announced that Medicare Part B premiums would go up by 14.5% to $170.10 in 2022, based on predicted demand at the time for Biogen BIIB and Eisai\u2019s ESAIY JP:4523 newly approved Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug, Aduhelm. But there were questions about whether the drug worked as well as the companies claimed, and Aduhelm\u2019s $56,000 price tag was cut in half before it was eventually discontinued.\n\nThe CMS ended up lowering Part B premiums in 2023 to $164.90 as a result of the price cut.\n\nThe most recent double-digit percentage increase in Part B premiums was 10% in 2017, though the cost of premiums stayed the same in 2018.\n\nDoes this mean I should pick a Medicare Advantage plan?\n\nAbout 7 million people on Medicare spend at least 10% of their income on their Part B premiums alone, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis last year that highlighted the impact of even single-digit percentage increases.\n\nAnd with Part B premiums continuing to rise, some experts have raised questions about whether more people may opt for Medicare Advantage plans, which sometimes have no monthly premium.\n\nHowever, there is growing concern that the cost of care for beneficiaries on private coverage is far more expensive than getting care from Medicare.\n\n\u201cMedicare is paying $80 billion [more] for Medicare Advantage enrollees than it would pay for if they were covered under traditional Medicare,\u201d KFF\u2019s Neuman said.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\n\u2018He lived alone in Section 8 housing\u2019: My late uncle\u2019s landlord disposed of his art collection.

Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 34% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.NYSE:MRK Historic Dividend November 22nd 2025\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Merck\n\nMerck Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.80 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.24. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 6.1% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Merck has grown earnings per share at 15% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.\n\nMerck Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Merck is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Merck that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Merck is not associated in any way with Tutanota, its mini-tender offer or the offer documentation.\n\nTutanota has made similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for shares of other publicly traded companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than 5% of a company's outstanding shares. This lets the offering company avoid many of the disclosure and procedural requirements the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires for tender offers. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors the same level of protections as provided by larger tender offers under U.S. federal securities laws.\n\nOn its website, the SEC advises that the people behind mini-tender offers \"frequently use mini-tender offers to catch shareholders off guard\" and that investors \"may end up selling at below-market prices.\" The SEC's website also contains important tips for investors regarding mini-tender offers.\n\nLike Tutanota\u2019s other offers, this one puts individual investors at risk because they may not realize they are selling their shares at a discount.

New York Federal Reserve President John Williams stated he sees \u201croom for a further adjustment\u201d in the near term, sparking a significant market rally. Following his remarks, the probability of the central bank cutting rates at its December meeting jumped from 39% to over 73%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. This positive sentiment provided relief to markets amid concerns over high valuations, particularly in AI-related stocks.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nResearch Tools & Consumables company Mettler-Toledo (NYSE:MTD) jumped 3.6%.

In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock gained 7.8% on the news that the major indices popped (Nasdaq +3.4%, S&P 500 +2.5%) in response to the positive outcome of U.S.-China trade negotiations, as both sides agreed to pause some tariffs for 90 days, signaling a potential turning point in ongoing tensions.\n\nThis rollback cuts U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports to 10%, giving companies breathing room to reset inventories and supply chains. However, President Trump clarified that tariffs could go \"substantially higher\" if a full deal with China wasn't reached during the 90-day pause, but not all the way back to the previous levels. Still, the agreement has cooled fears of a prolonged trade war, helping stabilize expectations for global growth and trade flows and fueling renewed optimism. The optimism appeared concentrated in key trade-sensitive sectors, particularly technology, retail, and industrials, as lower tariffs reduce cost pressures and restore cross-border demand.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAgilent is up 13.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $151.06 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $152.60 from January 2025.

These approvals represent the first PD-1 inhibitor plus ADC regimens for this patient population.\n\nThese approvals are based on data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-905 trial (also known as EV-303), which was conducted in collaboration with Pfizer and Astellas. Results, which were presented at the recent European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, showed that after a median follow-up of 25.6 months, KEYTRUDA plus Padcev, as perioperative treatment, demonstrated a statistically significant 60% reduction in the risk of event-free survival (EFS) events versus surgery alone in patients with MIBC who are not eligible for or declined cisplatin-based chemotherapy (HR=0.40 [95% CI, 0.28-0.57]; p<0.0001; 48/170 [28%] versus 95/174 [55%]; median EFS not reached [NR] [95% CI, 37.3-NR] versus 15.7 months [95% CI, 10.3-20.5]). KEYTRUDA plus Padcev also demonstrated a statistically significant 50% improvement in overall survival (OS) versus surgery alone (HR=0.50 [95% CI, 0.33-0.74]; p=0.0002; 38/170 [22%] versus 68/174 [39%]; median OS NR [95% CI, NR-NR] vs 41.7 [95% CI, 31.8-NR]). The trial demonstrated a statistically significant difference in pathologic complete response (pCR) rate (57.1% [95% CI: 49.3, 64.6] vs. 8.6% [95% CI: 4.9, 13.8]; p<0.0001). The effectiveness of KEYTRUDA QLEX for its approved indications has been established based upon evidence from the adequate and well-controlled studies conducted with KEYTRUDA and additional data from MK-3475A-D77 comparing the pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety profiles of KEYTRUDA QLEX and KEYTRUDA.\n\nKEYTRUDA QLEX is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to berahyaluronidase alfa, hyaluronidase or to any of its excipients. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time during or after treatment with KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. Additionally, fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after treatment. Consider the benefit vs risks for these patients. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1/PD-L1-blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled trials due to the potential for increased mortality. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on their mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can each cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

These approvals, based on striking event-free and overall survival benefits, may represent an important practice-changing advance for these patients who\u2019ve had no new options in decades.\"\n\n\"Our company\u2019s ongoing commitment to putting patients at the center of finding new innovations in cancer care has made the introduction of these new options a reality for patients who are truly in need,\" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. \"Moreover, we are honored to provide these patients who previously had only one option \u2014 surgery \u2014 with a choice to receive their immunotherapy either intravenously or subcutaneously.\"\n\nStudy design and additional data supporting the approval\n\nKEYNOTE-905, also known as EV-303, is an open-label, randomized, multi-arm, controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03924895) evaluating perioperative KEYTRUDA, with or without Padcev, versus surgery alone in patients with MIBC who are either not eligible for or declined cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The trial enrolled 344 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive either:\n\nNeoadjuvant KEYTRUDA 200 mg over 30 minutes as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 and enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle for 3 cycles prior to surgery, followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA 200 mg over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle for 14 cycles and adjuvant enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles (n=170). Immediate radical cystectomy (RC) and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) alone (n=174).\n\nTreatment continued until completion of study medications, disease progression, not undergoing or refusal of RC and PLND, disease recurrence in the adjuvant phase, or unacceptable toxicity. Assessment of tumor status, including CT/MRI, was performed at baseline, within 5 weeks prior to RC and PLND, and at 6 weeks post radical cystectomy. Following RC and PLND, assessment of tumor status, including cystoscopy and urine cytology for patients who did not undergo surgery, was performed every 12 weeks up to 2 years, and every 24 weeks thereafter.\n\nA total of 149 (88%) patients in the KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin arm and 156 (90%) patients in the RC and PLND alone arm underwent RC and PLND.\n\nThe trial was not designed to isolate the effect of KEYTRUDA in each phase (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) of treatment.\n\nThe major efficacy outcome measure of this trial was EFS defined as the time from randomization to the first of: disease progression preventing curative surgery, failure to undergo surgery for participants with muscle invasive residual disease, incomplete surgical resection, local or distant recurrence after surgery, or death. OS and pCR rate as assessed by blinded independent pathology review were additional efficacy outcome measures.\n\nFor the 167 patients who received KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant phase, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks was 1.4 months (range: 1 day to 2.7 months) and the median number of cycles of KEYTRUDA was 3 (range: 1 to 3) out of the planned 3 cycles in the neoadjuvant phase. For the 96 patients who received KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant phase, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks was 8.5 months (range: 1 day to 12.9 months) and the median number of cycles of KEYTRUDA was 12 (range: 1 to 14) out of the planned 14 cycles in the adjuvant phase. Across the combined neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases (n=167), the median number of cycles of KEYTRUDA was 5 (range: 1, 17) out of the planned 17 cycles.\n\nIn KEYNOTE-905, the most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) occurring in cisplatin-ineligible patients with MIBC treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin (n =167) were rash (54%), pruritus (47%), fatigue (47%), peripheral neuropathy (39%), alopecia (35%), dysgeusia (35%), diarrhea (34%), constipation (28%), decreased appetite (28%), nausea (26%), urinary tract infection (24%), dry eye (21%), and weight loss (20%).\n\nIn the neoadjuvant phase of KEYNOTE-905, serious adverse reactions occurred in 27% (n=167) of patients; the most frequent (\u22652%) were urinary tract infection (3.6%) and hematuria (2.4%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.2% of patients, including myasthenia gravis and toxic epidermal necrolysis (0.6% each). Additional fatal adverse reactions were reported in 2.7% of patients in the post-surgery phase before adjuvant treatment started, including sepsis and intestinal obstruction (1.4% each). Permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 15% of patients; the most frequent (>1%) were rash (2.4%, including generalized exfoliative dermatitis), increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, diarrhea, dysgeusia, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (1.2% each). Of the 167 patients in the KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin arm who received neoadjuvant treatment, 7 (4.2%) patients did not receive surgery due to adverse reactions. The adverse reactions that led to cancellation of surgery were acute myocardial infarction, bile duct cancer, colon cancer, respiratory distress, urinary tract infection, and two deaths due to myasthenia gravis and toxic epidermal necrolysis (0.6% each).\n\nOf the 146 patients who received neoadjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin and underwent radical cystectomy, 6 (4.1%) patients experienced delay of surgery (defined as time from last neoadjuvant treatment to surgery exceeding 8 weeks) due to adverse reactions.\n\nIn the adjuvant phase of KEYNOTE-905, serious adverse reactions occurred in 43% (n=100); the most frequent (\u22652%) were urinary tract infection (8%); acute kidney injury and pyelonephritis (5% each); urosepsis (4%); and hypokalemia, intestinal obstruction, and sepsis (2% each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 7% of patients, including urosepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, death, myocardial infarction, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and pseudomonal pneumonia (1% each). Permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 28% of patients; the most frequent (>1%) were diarrhea (5%), peripheral neuropathy, acute kidney injury, and pneumonitis (2% each).\n\nAbout KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg\n\nKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body\u2019s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.\n\nMerck has the industry\u2019s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.\n\nAbout KEYTRUDA QLEX\u2122 (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) injection for subcutaneous use\n\nKEYTRUDA QLEX is a fixed-combination drug product of pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa. Pembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody and berahyaluronidase alfa enhances dispersion and permeability to enable subcutaneous administration of pembrolizumab. KEYTRUDA QLEX is administered as a subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, avoiding the 5 cm area around the navel, over one minute every three weeks (2.4 mL) or over two minutes every six weeks (4.8 mL).\n\nSelected KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) and KEYTRUDA QLEX\u2122 (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) Indications in the U.S.\n\nUrothelial Cancer\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated, in combination with enfortumab vedotin, for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, as single agents, are each indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma:\n\nwho are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with enfortumab vedotin, as neoadjuvant treatment and then continued after cystectomy as adjuvant treatment, are each indicated for the treatment of adult patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, as single agents, are each indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy.\n\nSee additional selected KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.\n\nSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX\n\nContraindications\n\nKEYTRUDA QLEX is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to berahyaluronidase alfa, hyaluronidase or to any of its excipients.\n\nSevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are monoclonal antibodies that belong to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.\n\nMonitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX require interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\n\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 5% (13/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including fatal (0.4%), Grade 3 (2%), and Grade 2 (1.2%) adverse reactions.\n\nPneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.\n\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.\n\nImmune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.2% (3/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 3 (0.8%) and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions.\n\nHepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.4% (1/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions.\n\nKEYTRUDA With Axitinib or KEYTRUDA QLEX With Axitinib\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, when either is used in combination with axitinib, can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib or KEYTRUDA QLEX and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.\n\nWith the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.\n\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\nAdrenal Insufficiency\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity.

Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 2% (5/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.8%) adverse reactions.\n\nHypophysitis\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA,\n\nincluding Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\n\nThyroid Disorders\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity.\n\nThyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients.\n\nHyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement.

Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity.\n\nImmune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.6% (4/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 4 (0.8%) and Grade 3 (0.8%) adverse reactions.\n\nOther Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\n\nThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA, KEYTRUDA QLEX, or were reported with the use of other anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis (2.8%), duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.\n\nHypersensitivity and Infusion- or Administration-Related Reactions\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause severe or life-threatening administration-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. With KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion- and administration-related systemic reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. Infusion-related reactions have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Hypersensitivity and administration related systemic reactions occurred in 3.2% (8/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy, including Grade 2 (2.8%). Interrupt injection (if not already fully administered) and resume if symptoms resolve for mild or moderate systemic reactions. For severe or life-threatening systemic reactions, stop injection and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX.\n\nComplications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)\n\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n\nIncreased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma\n\nIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.\n\nEmbryofetal Toxicity\n\nBased on their mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can each cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nIn study MK-3475A-D77, when KEYTRUDA QLEX was administered with chemotherapy in metastatic non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients.

Pembrolizumab exposures in pediatric patients 12 years and older who weigh greater than 40 kg are predicted to be within range of those observed in adults at the same dosage.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA as a single agent have been established in pediatric patients with melanoma (stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection in pediatric patients 12 and older), MCC, and MSI-H or dMMR cancer.\n\nUse of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients for these indications is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA QLEX have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age for the treatment of melanoma, MCC, and MSI-H or dMMR cancer.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX have not been established in pediatric patients for other approved indications shown.\n\nAdverse reactions that occurred at a \u226510% higher rate in pediatric patients when compared to adults were pyrexia (33%), leukopenia (30%), vomiting (29%), neutropenia (28%), headache (25%), abdominal pain (23%), thrombocytopenia (22%), Grade 3 anemia (17%), decreased lymphocyte count (13%), and decreased white blood cell count (11%).\n\nGeriatric Use\n\nOf the 564 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin, 44% (n=247) were 65-74 years and 26% (n=144) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients. Patients 75 years of age or older treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 4% in patients younger than 75 and 7% in patients 75 years or older.\n\nOf the 167 patients with MIBC treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin, 37% (n=61) were 65-74 years and 46% (n=77) were 75 years or older. Patients 75 years of age or older treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 4% in patients younger than 75 and 12% in patients 75 years or older.\n\nAdditional Selected KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX Indications in the U.S.\n\nMelanoma\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.\n\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic nonsquamous non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, as single agents, are each indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) \u22651%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:\n\nstage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic.\n\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, as single agents, are each indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS \u22651%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Let's demystify the numbers together and see if there's opportunity hiding beneath the surface. Despite its reputation as a solid pharmaceuticals and life sciences player, Merck KGaA's stock is down 4.5% over the last week and has dropped 20.0% year-to-date. This has raised questions about shifting growth prospects or changing risk perceptions. Recent headlines have focused on Merck KGaA's ongoing research partnerships and its strategic expansion in the biotech space. Both could signal long-term innovation potential. Market watchers are also talking about regulatory trends and sector headwinds that could be influencing investor sentiment recently. Currently, Merck KGaA scores a 5 out of 6 on our undervaluation checklist. This suggests there is significant value according to standard metrics. Next, we will break down those approaches and, later in the article, introduce a fresh perspective that goes even deeper into valuation.\n\nFind out why Merck KGaA's -19.3% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.\n\nApproach 1: Merck KGaA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\n\nThe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates what a company is worth by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to their present value. For Merck KGaA, this approach uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, which looks at recent cash flows and estimates how they will evolve over coming years.\n\nCurrently, Merck KGaA generates Free Cash Flow of approximately \u20ac1.92 billion. Analysts forecast that annual cash flows will grow in the coming years, reaching an estimated \u20ac3.57 billion by the end of 2029. Beyond this point, projections are extrapolated to provide a full ten-year outlook, showing steady growth. FCF is expected to surpass \u20ac4.4 billion by 2035.\n\nBased on these cash flow projections, the DCF model calculates an intrinsic value of \u20ac254.63 per share. Compared to recent market prices, this carries an implied 55.9% discount, which suggests Merck KGaA may be undervalued based on its anticipated future earnings power.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUED\n\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Merck KGaA is undervalued by 55.9%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover 918 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows.MRK Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Merck KGaA.\n\nApproach 2: Merck KGaA Price vs Earnings\n\nThe Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is one of the most recognized ways to value profitable companies like Merck KGaA. It tells us how much investors are willing to pay for each euro of current earnings, and works best for businesses with stable and positive earnings profiles. PE ratios can signal whether a stock trades at a premium or discount compared to its earning power.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGrowth expectations and perceived risk play a big part in setting a \"normal\" PE for any company. Rapidly growing or lower-risk companies tend to have higher \u201cfair\u201d PE ratios, while riskier or slower-growing peers usually see lower multiples. For Merck KGaA, the current PE ratio stands at 16.5x, which is below both the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 23.5x and the peer group average of 42.9x. This could suggest the market sees slower growth or higher risk for Merck KGaA compared to its peers.\n\nSimply Wall St\u2019s proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" goes a step further than basic peer or sector comparisons. It estimates what the PE multiple should be for Merck KGaA, considering factors like expected earnings growth, profit margins, size, and specific risks. For Merck KGaA, the Fair Ratio is calculated at 24.8x, notably above the current market PE. Because the Fair Ratio incorporates company-specific strengths and risks, it is a more tailored benchmark than a blunt industry average. With shares trading at 16.5x earnings versus a fair value of 24.8x, Merck KGaA appears significantly undervalued using this approach.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUEDXTRA:MRK PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\n\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1421 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth.\n\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Merck KGaA Narrative\n\nEarlier we mentioned that there's an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your personal story about a company, where you outline what you believe about its future revenue, earnings, and margins, then see how those views translate into a financial forecast and a Fair Value estimate. By connecting Merck KGaA\u2019s business developments to the numbers, Narratives give you a tailored picture of what the company is really worth, not just what the market or analysts suggest.\n\nNarratives are easy to use and available to every investor on the Simply Wall St platform\u2019s Community page, already trusted by millions. They help you decide when to buy or sell by letting you compare your own Fair Value directly against the current Price, making investment decisions more intuitive and transparent. The best part is that these Narratives are dynamic, updating instantly as news arrives or quarterly results are released, so your view always reflects the latest information.\n\nFor example, some investors may believe Merck KGaA\u2019s innovation pipeline and global health trends justify a robust Fair Value near \u20ac191, while others focused on competitive pressures and patent risks might use a much lower value of \u20ac100. Narratives let you see and test these perspectives for yourself.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Merck KGaA?

Koselugo is already approved to treat certain pediatric patients with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable PN in the United States, the EU, Japan, China and other countries.\n\nIn the United States, a granule formulation of Koselugo was also recently approved by the FDA for young children aged one year and older with NF1 PN.\n\nRationale Behind the FDA Nod for AZN\u2019s Koselugo Expanded Use\n\nThe FDA approval of the label expansion of AstraZeneca\u2019s Koselugo to treat adult patients with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable PN was backed by data from the global phase III KOMET study. In the primary endpoint analysis of the KOMET study, treatment with Koselugo demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall response rate (ORR) of 20% compared to 5% with placebo by cycle 16.\n\nORR represents the proportion of patients who achieve either a confirmed complete response (tumor disappearance) or a partial response (a tumor volume reduction of at least 20%).\n\nAdditionally, approximately 86% of patients receiving Koselugo therapy achieved an observed duration of response of at least 6 months.

Per AZN, up to half of individuals with NF1 develop non-cancerous PN in the brain, spinal cord, or nerves, which may emerge later in life and grow substantially, causing disfigurement, pain, and various functional impairments.\n\nKoselugo enjoys the FDA\u2019s Orphan Drug designation in the United States, the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of NF1.\n\nAstraZeneca has a collaboration deal with Merck MRK for Koselugo. In the third-quarter 2025 earnings release, AstraZeneca announced modifying the Koselugo partnership with Merck, having assumed full global responsibility for the drug\u2019s costs, revenues and profits. Previously, AZN and MRK split Koselugo\u2019s pre-tax profits and losses equally.

However, Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID operational revenues are improving, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel, Padcev and Eliquis, recent launches and newly acquired products like Nurtec and those from Seagen (December 2023).\n\nThe year 2023 was a record year for Pfizer in terms of new drug approvals. It received nine new medicine/vaccine approvals in 2023 that have begun to contribute to top-line growth. In 2024, it gained approval for a gene therapy for hemophilia, Hympavzi (marstacimab). In December 2023, Pfizer acquired Seagen, which strengthened its position in oncology by adding four antibody-drug conjugates or ADCs \u2014 Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak. The acquired Seagen products contributed meaningfully to Pfizer\u2019s revenues in 2024 and 2025 so far. Seagen also has some next-generation ADC candidates in its pipeline.\n\nPfizer's recently launched and acquired products rose approximately 9% operationally in the first nine months of 2025, with the momentum expected to continuein 2026.\n\nPfizer faces some near-term challenges, including softness in sales of its COVID products, U.S. Medicare Part D headwinds and the upcoming loss of exclusivity (LOE) cliff in the 2026-2030 period. However, Pfizer\u2019s key drugs like Vyndaqel, Padcev and its recently launched and acquired products should help the company largely offset its LOEs over the next several years. Pfizer expects the 2025 to 2030 revenue CAGR to be approximately 6% despite the LOE cliff.\n\nCompetition in the Oncology Space\n\nPfizer is one of the largest drugmakers of cancer medicines. Other large players in the oncology space are AstraZeneca AZN, Merck MRK and Bristol-Myers BMY.\n\nFor AstraZeneca, oncology sales now comprise around 43% of total revenues. Sales in its oncology segment rose 16% in the nine months of 2025. AstraZeneca\u2019s strong oncology performance was driven by medicines such as Tagrisso, Lynparza, Imfinzi, Calquence and Enhertu (in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo).\n\nMerck\u2019s key oncology medicines are PD-LI inhibitor, Keytruda and PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, which it markets in partnership with AstraZeneca. Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounts for more than 50% of Merck\u2019s pharmaceutical sales. Keytruda recorded sales of $23.3 billion in the first nine months of 2025, up 8% year over year.\n\nBristol-Myers\u2019 key cancer drug is PD-LI inhibitor, Opdivo, which accounts for around 20% of its total revenues. Opdivo\u2019s sales rose 8% to $7.54 billion in the nine months of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPFE\u2019s Stock Price, Estimates & Valuation\n\nPfizer\u2019s stock has declined 8% so far this year against an increase of 15.2% for the industry.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Pfizer appears attractive relative to the industry and is trading below its 5-year mean.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Visa Inc. V, Merck & Co., Inc. MRK, The Southern Co. SO, Community Bancorp CMTV and Comstock Holding Companies, Inc. CHCI.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Visa, Merck and Southern Cos\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and The Southern Co., as well as two micro-cap stocks Community Bancorp and Comstock Holding Companies, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings beat estimates. Its strong market position is underpinned by consistent volume-driven growth, acquisitions and technological leadership in digital payments.\n\nExpansion in cross-border volumes, rising transactions and investments in AI and stablecoin infrastructure enhance its future prospects. Its total revenue rose 11% YoY in FY25 along with 13% growth in cross-border volume. A robust financial position with ample liquidity and shareholder returns further supports long-term growth.\n\nHowever, it faces rising client incentives and expenses, which can weigh on margins. Regulatory pressures and potential legislative changes pose additional risks to its fee structure. While declining cash volumes align with its digital strategy, regional softness warrants monitoring. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\nStory continues\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\nShares of Merck have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (-1.7% vs. +17.9%). The company is facing rising competitive and generic pressure on some drugs, and persistent challenges for Gardasil in China remain overhangs. There are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to successfully navigate the Keytruda loss of exclusivity period and potential competition for the drug.\n\nMerck\u2019s third-quarter earnings and sales beat estimates. Its blockbuster drug, Keytruda, and new products have been driving sales. With label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth.\n\nAnimal health is also contributing to growth. Merck has been making meaningful pipeline progress. Moreover, it is actively pursuing M&A deals to enhance its pipeline and diversify away from Keytruda.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\n\nSouthern Company\u2019s shares have gained +11.7% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry\u2019s gain of +29.4%. The company, being a leading U.S. electric utility in the Southeast, offers a solid opportunity with its recession-proof model, substantial load pipeline, and investments in regulated utilities like natural gas and battery storage.\n\nSouthern Company\u2019s strategic contracts and protective tariff structures provide a stable earnings outlook, while its $76 billion capital plan supports growth through grid modernization. Management has signaled a potential upward revision in earnings growth by 2027.\n\nHowever, Southern faces risks from high leverage, which limits financial flexibility, and its cautious approach to nuclear energy may leave it behind peers. Also, regulatory challenges, economic slowdowns, and increasing competition from decentralized energy solutions pose threats. Therefore, the company warrants a cautious stance from investors.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Southern Company here >>>)\n\nShares of Community Bancorp have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Northeast industry over the year-to-date period (+47.8% vs. +1.7%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $130.91 million delivers strong investment appeal, backed by sustained earnings momentum, driven primarily by robust net interest income growth and disciplined cost control.\n\nEarnings rose sharply in 2025, supported by favorable loan repricing and lower borrowing costs. Broad-based loan growth across residential, commercial, municipal and purchased segments has been achieved without compromising credit quality, with declining nonperformers and stable reserves. Capital strength continues to build, reflected in rising book value and reduced unrealized securities losses, enhancing flexibility for dividends and future growth.\n\nNon-interest income expanded steadily, providing valuable revenue diversification amid rate volatility, while expense discipline preserved operating leverage. Continued dividend increases underscore a consistent shareholder-return focus.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Community Bancorp here >>>)\n\nComstock\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry over the year-to-date period (+69.8% vs. -7.1%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $135.46 million reinforces its position as a premier developer of transit-oriented mixed-use real estate due to its strategic execution. A landmark lease with Booz Allen Hamilton at Reston Station enhances cash flow stability and brand prestige.\n\nThe JW Marriott Reston Station opening elevates Comstock\u2019s hospitality footprint, offering premium amenities and strong recurring income. The Rockville multifamily acquisition via the Institutional Venture Platform supports growth, diversification and capital efficiency.\n\nHowever, rising labor costs, excessive reliance on related-party revenues and weak free cash flow pressure margins and liquidity. Additionally, compliance risks and geographic concentration in the D.C. metro area expose the firm to regulatory and regional volatility. Despite these headwinds, the stock has significantly outperformed peers, and valuation remains attractive relative to its growth potential.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Comstock here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

The investment banks' analysts expect the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) to log an average annual gain of only 6.5% over the coming 10 years, down from its long-term annualized pace of around 10%. But why? For some of the reasons you might readily guess (like steep valuations), but also some that aren't quite as obvious.\n\nIt's not exactly a reason to panic, though. See, Goldman's also got some tips to help you navigate this soft patch, and perhaps even beat this broad average.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHere comes the valuation headwind\n\nIt's a tired argument, but a reasonable one all the same -- as a whole, U.S. stocks are expensive right now. Goldman's number-crunching indicates the S&P 500's trailing price-to-earnings ratio stands near a multiyear high of 23.\n\nAnd yes, Goldman Sachs analysts also acknowledge that it's a small number of massive companies involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution that are responsible for the broader valuation problem. It just doesn't matter. If and when these stocks finally suffer their long-overdue valuation correction, it will take a while, and will likely create a ripple effect that drags on the rest of the market ... and the economy itself. Specifically, Goldman believes shrinking premium valuations will effectively work against the market's net progress by about 1% per year through 2035.\n\nThen there are interest rates. As the report goes on to explain, much of the widening of the S&P 500's profit margins since 1990 \"has been attributable to falling interest rates and corporate tax rates, neither of which appears likely to decline as substantially during the next decade.\"\n\nInvestors had to know this day of reckoning was coming sooner or later, of course.\n\nAnd yet, Goldman isn't exactly discouraging investors from getting into and remaining in the stock market. It's just saying investors might want to adapt accordingly, by favoring stocks other than the market's present darlings.\n\nTime for some strategic tweaking\n\nThe thing is, the lackluster outlook in question is mostly an American-centric concern. Plenty of other regions are expected to fare better, like Japan, as well as the rest of Asia. Their average market growth outlooks for the coming 10 years are 8.2% and 10.3%, respectively, while emerging markets are expected to dish out average annualized returns of 10.9% through 2035, all led by raw earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis dynamic puts foreign stocks like China's Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) and South America's MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) -- the so-called Amazon of Latin America -- into the spotlight. While Alibaba's roots are in the e-commerce realm, its top growth engine for the coming decade is likely to be artificial intelligence. It's even developed its own AI processing chip that's competitive with hardware made by Nvidia. Meanwhile, MercadoLibre is capitalizing on the rapid proliferation of web-connected smartphones in South America, driving its top line 39% higher (or 49% higher on a constant-currency basis) for the three-month stretch ending in September alone, extending well-established trends.\n\nMercadoLibre and Alibaba also bring something else strategic to the table. That's the fact that both American depositary receipts -- or ADRs -- are denominated in U.S. dollars at a time when Goldman's strategists feel the greenback is about 15% overvalued. As this premium unwinds and reinflates other countries' currencies, it could add approximately 2 percentage points' worth of net growth to most foreign stocks every year through 2035.\n\nThen there's the other outcome of this paradigm shift. Although Goldman's researchers didn't explicitly recommend dividend stocks as a means of beating the market for the next 10 years, the report repeatedly points out that dividends will make up an important part of the total returns from every region's stocks during the decade ahead.\n\nThis bodes well for dividend-focused companies like Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) as well as drugmakers like Pfizer(NYSE: PFE) and Merck(NYSE: MRK). In fact, both pharmaceutical stocks offer above-average yields right now thanks to weakness linked to unwarranted worries that neither has the brightest of foreseeable futures. They do! Merck, for instance, contends its current developmental pipeline could be generating as much as $50 billion in yearly revenue by the mid-2030s, eventually replacing its cancer-fighting Keytruda, which currently accounts for half of its sales but will begin losing the crux of its patent protection in 2028. Its dividend payments should remain intact.\n\nDon't panic -- just adapt\n\nLike any other outlook, take Goldman's with a grain of salt. It acknowledges it's only a best guess using information that's currently available, and could ultimately be wrong.\n\nStill, as veteran investors can attest, the market is forever changing. While philosophical strategies like index-based investing with instruments such the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY) never really go out of style even in subpar market environments, it would be na\u00efve to believe the next few years will look precisely like the last few have when so much has changed... like interest rates, the U.S. government's massive debt overhang, tense trade relations, and the advent of AI that's made so many foreign companies surprisingly competitive so quickly. As an investor, you should be willing to recognize and adapt to these changes as merited, perhaps beginning with what you expect from the U.S. stock market's most important health barometer for the foreseeable future.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily BioPharma Dive newsletter.\n\nAnaptysbio and its partner GSK are suing each other, claiming breach of contract over the big drugmaker\u2019s license to market the likely blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Jemperli.\n\nA California-based developer of immune-modulating antibody drugs, Anaptysbio claimed in a Delaware court that GSK violated the terms of its decade-old deal by testing some of its experimental cancer drugs with Jemperli competitors, like Merck & Co.\u2019s Keytruda. That suit came in response to GSK\u2019s earlier action in the same court that said Anaptysbio\u2019s allegations were a breach of contract.\n\nThe lawsuits relate to a 2014 deal Anaptysbio made with a company called Tesaro, which licensed Jemperli, then an experimental PD-1 inhibitor that works similarly to Keytruda and Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo. GSK bought Tesaro in 2019 for $5.1 billion, mainly for the ovarian cancer drug Zejula, but at the time executives of the British big pharma also highlighted Jemperli\u2019s promise.\n\nGSK hit first, saying its Tesaro subsidiary was filing a lawsuit because \u201cconduct by Anaptysbio is in material breach of the existing license agreement.\u201d It wants the court to terminate the agreement, grant a permanent license and halve the royalties due to Anaptysbio.\n\nAnaptysbio countersued, claiming GSK\u2019s testing of drugs it developed with Keytruda and other PD-1 drugs first, rather than with Jemperli, violated the terms of the license.\n\n\u201cWhile Anaptys had approached Tesaro to engage in good faith discussions to potentially resolve these claims, on Nov. 20, 2025, Tesaro, without notice, initiated a lawsuit against Anaptys,\u201d the company said in a release.\n\nIn 2020, Anaptysbio won an amended license from GSK that boosted royalties to Jemperli and paid royalties for Zejula sales, in return for GSK gaining the right to test Zejula with third-party drugs.\n\nJemperli recorded sales of 600 million pounds, or about $785 million, through the first nine months of 2025, putting it on track to become a $1 billion seller by the end of the year. That would position Anaptysbio to collect a $75 million milestone payment, in addition to the 8% royalties it receives on sales of up to $1 billion and the 12% it will receive on sales between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\nAn Anaptysbio spokesperson said the lawsuits are still under seal and should be available within a week, with redactions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPreserving the revenue stream will be key to Anaptysbio\u2019s plan to split off a royalty business by the end of 2026.

The company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings beat estimates. Its strong market position is underpinned by consistent volume-driven growth, acquisitions and technological leadership in digital payments. \r\n\r\nExpansion in cross-border volumes, rising transactions and investments in AI and stablecoin infrastructure enhance its future prospects. Its total revenue rose 11% YoY in FY25 along with 13% growth in cross-border volume. A robust financial position with ample liquidity and shareholder returns further supports long-term growth. \r\n\r\nHowever, it faces rising client incentives and expenses, which can weigh on margins. Regulatory pressures and potential legislative changes pose additional risks to its fee structure. While declining cash volumes align with its digital strategy, regional softness warrants monitoring. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Merck have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (-1.7% vs. +17.9%). The company is facing rising competitive and generic pressure on some drugs, and persistent challenges for Gardasil in China remain overhangs. There are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to successfully navigate the Keytruda loss of exclusivity period and potential competition for the drug.\r\n\r\nMerck\u2019s third-quarter earnings and sales beat estimates. Its blockbuster drug, Keytruda, and new products have been driving sales. With label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. \r\n\r\nAnimal health is also contributing to growth. Merck has been making meaningful pipeline progress. Moreover, it is actively pursuing M&A deals to enhance its pipeline and diversify away from Keytruda.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\r\n\r\nSouthern Company\u2019s shares have gained +11.7% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry\u2019s gain of +29.4%. The company being a leading U.S. electric utility in the Southeast, offers a solid opportunity with its recession-proof model, substantial load pipeline, and investments in regulated utilities like natural gas and battery storage. \r\n\r\nSouthern Company\u2019s strategic contracts and protective tariff structures provide a stable earnings outlook, while its $76 billion capital plan supports growth through grid modernization. Management has signaled a potential upward revision in earnings growth by 2027. \r\n\r\nHowever, Southern faces risks from high leverage, which limits financial flexibility, and its cautious approach to nuclear energy may leave it behind peers. Also, regulatory challenges, economic slowdowns, and increasing competition from decentralized energy solutions pose threats. Therefore, the company warrants a cautious stance from investors.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Southern Company here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Community Bancorp have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Northeast industry over the year-to-date period (+47.8% vs. +1.7%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $130.91 million delivers strong investment appeal, backed by sustained earnings momentum, driven primarily by robust net interest income growth and disciplined cost control. \r\n\r\nEarnings rose sharply in 2025, supported by favorable loan repricing and lower borrowing costs. Broad-based loan growth across residential, commercial, municipal and purchased segments has been achieved without compromising credit quality, with declining nonperformers and stable reserves. Capital strength continues to build, reflected in rising book value and reduced unrealized securities losses, enhancing flexibility for dividends and future growth. \r\n\r\nNon-interest income expanded steadily, providing valuable revenue diversification amid rate volatility, while expense discipline preserved operating leverage. Continued dividend increases underscore a consistent shareholder-return focus.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Community Bancorp here >>>)\r\n\r\nComstock\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry over the year-to-date period (+69.8% vs. -7.1%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $135.46 million reinforces its position as a premier developer of transit-oriented mixed-use real estate due to its strategic execution. A landmark lease with Booz Allen Hamilton at Reston Station enhances cash flow stability and brand prestige. \r\n\r\nThe JW Marriott Reston Station opening elevates Comstock\u2019s hospitality footprint, offering premium amenities and strong recurring income. The Rockville multifamily acquisition via the Institutional Venture Platform supports growth, diversification and capital efficiency. \r\n\r\nHowever, rising labor costs, excessive reliance on related-party revenues and weak free cash flow pressure margins and liquidity. Additionally, compliance risks and geographic concentration in the D.C. metro area expose the firm to regulatory and regional volatility. Despite these headwinds, the stock has significantly outperformed peers, and valuation remains attractive relative to its growth potential. \r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Comstock here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

This landmark public-private industry partnership commits $120 million of workforce investment from AstraZeneca, Lilly, and Merck, and builds directly on their recently announced $12.5 billion of capex expansion investment in Virginia, which will create thousands of new jobs over the next several years.\n\nThe Virginia Center for APM will span Virginia's Richmond-Petersburg-Charlottesville corridor in central Virginia \u2013 a U.S. EDA-designated tech hub for advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing \u2013 and create a neutral, industry-aligned workforce training and education center that offers opportunity for all Virginians.

In both studies, DOR/ISL showed a generally similar safety profile to the respective comparator regimens.\n\nPlease note that Merck currently markets doravirine for treating adults with HIV-1 in the United States, either as a monotherapy under the brand name Pifeltro, as well as part of the single-tablet combination under the brand name Delstrigo (doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).\n\nMRK Gains EU Nod for Subcutaneous Keytruda\n\nIn a separate press release, Merck announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved the subcutaneous (under the skin or SC) formulation of its blockbuster PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda (pembrolizumab). This version, which will be marketed as Keytruda SC, is approved across all solid tumor indications for which the drug\u2019s intravenous (into the vein or IV) version is already approved in the EU.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe EC\u2019s approval was expected, as the advisory committee to the European Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of the new formulation in September 2025. The SC version of Keytruda is also currently approved in the United States and is marketed under the brand name Keytruda Qlex.\n\nA major advantage offered by Keytruda Qlex/SC over the IV formulation is improved patient convenience. Delivering a drug SC instead of IV can significantly reduce administration time. Per Merck, the SC version can be administered to patients in as little as one minute compared with the IV formulation, which takes at least 30 minutes. This also likely eases the burden on healthcare facilities, making treatment more accessible and potentially boosting adoption rates.\n\nThe EU approval is supported by data from pivotal studies, which showed that treatment with Keytruda SC was at least as effective as the IV version.\n\nCogent Biosciences, Inc.

In particular, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DOWI) and the Dow Jones Industrials SPDR (DIA) ETF look especially vulnerable to me. That doesn\u2019t mean gains are not possible, only that risk is high.\n\nSo my mission, apart from looking at possibly buying an ETF that runs counter to DIA, or buying a put option on it, is to see where the outliers are. That is, the stocks within that tidy 30-member index that might be upside leaders anyway. Even if they simply outperform in a down market, there\u2019s \u201calpha\u201d and positive return to be had. In a treacherous market like this one, why not look around every corner, and under every rock? I try to.\n\nSo with that as the task, here are three Dow Industrials components that I picked out of the 30 in that venerable index. They all have at least a fighting chance to earn a profitable return over the balance of 2025. Here they are.www.barchart.com\n\nStock #1: Merck\n\nMerck (MRK) has the best-looking chart in the Dow 30 by far. And it\u2019s about time! It has been languishing amid a range of issues, some related to drug pricing regulation, some to the company\u2019s own maladies. But this is still a blue-chip healthcare firm. And the weekly chart shows promise. An earnings multiple under 11x adds to the attraction here.www.barchart.com\n\nStock #2: 3M\n\n3M (MMM) has quietly had an outstanding run. And while it is far from undervalued technically, it is a rock-solid blue-chip, if not the most dynamic. 21x earnings is not a steal, but these are times when simply avoiding terrible chart patterns might end up looking like a \u201cwin.\u201d The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) here is hinting at another leg higher, and MMM is making up for some lost time here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nStock #3: Chevronwww.barchart.com\n\nChevron (CVX) is a good example of the fact that at times like these, a range-bound chart coupled with a price-sales ratio under 2x is a good combination. There\u2019s a nice 4.5% dividend yield here too.\n\nThese three stocks all have upside potential. But just as importantly, their charts and valuations are not as risky looking to me as most tech stocks. That alone could be a ticket to success the remainder of this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rob Isbitts did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Here's What Investors Need to Know.", "content": "Key Points\n\nMerck has announced plans to acquire Cidara Therapeutics for $9.2 billion, or $221.50 per share. Representing a heavy premium to the biotech's prior trading price, the bid caused its shares to surge. A bidding war isn't likely, but there are other profitable takeaways for investors from this news. 10 stocks we like better than Cidara Therapeutics \u203a\n\nJust prior to last week's takeover news, Cidara Therapeutics(NASDAQ: CDTX) was already one of the year's top-performing stocks. Trading in the mid-$20s at the start of 2025, by mid-November, this highflier among biotech stocks had surged more than fivefold, to around $106 per share.\n\nBut then came news of Merck's (NYSE: MRK) plans to acquire Cidara for $221.50 per share, or a 109% premium to its prior trading price. As a result of the takeover news, shares surged by over 100% on Nov. 14, the day of the deal announcement.\n\nWhy is Merck willing to pony up for Cidara? Could other bidders emerge? If this is a done deal, are there any takeaways for investors? Let's explore each question and see how this news could help identify similar such opportunities.\n\nMerck's offer is all about Cidara's promising flu therapy candidate\n\nFor several years, Cidara Therapeutics has been developing CD388, a non-vaccine alternative for flu prevention. Interestingly enough, until 2024, Cidara partnered with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen division on the development of this candidate. Janssen backed out last year, following its decision to get out of infectious disease drug and vaccine development.\n\nJanssen may be regretting this decision now. Throughout 2025, Cidara has made rapid clinical trial progress with CD388, and is currently at the phase 3 trial stage. In turn, the specter of Cidara's commercialization has been key to the stock's above-mentioned outsized price performance. After this big run-up, at first it may seem surprising that Merck is not only willing to buy the company, but at more than double the stock's prior all-time high.\n\nHowever, to say that CD388 has blockbuster drug potential is an understatement. In the United States, as many as 81 million people get the flu each season. These infections lead to as many as 1.3 million hospitalizations. As many as 10% of these hospitalization cases end up fatal.\n\nGiven the dangers of influenza, especially among at-risk populations like the elderly, a high-efficacy non-vaccine alternative offering protection against all flu strains would undoubtedly be in high demand. Cidara believes that if the treatment makes it to market, it could become available to more than 100 million Americans. The biotech company has also noted that peak sales could hit $3.1 billion by 2040.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nLikely a done deal, but two takeaways for investors\n\nCurrently, the spread between Cidara's stock price and the takeover bid is around 1.75%. This is a very thin merger arbitrage spread, suggesting not only a high likelihood of this deal closing, but a low likelihood that another bidder will emerge for the company. If Wall Street were betting on a mergers and acquisitions battle, the stock would likely be trading at a premium to Merck's offer.\n\nYet while there may be limited opportunity to profit from Cidara Therapeutics, if you've yet to buy it, there could be some other profitable takeaways from this news. For one, this offer may help to strengthen the bull case for Merck. Like other big pharma stocks, Merck shares have struggled, due to patent cliff concerns. However, with its plans to buy Cidara, not to mention other pending biotech acquisition deals, Merck could replenish its pipeline well before Keytruda, the company's flagship drug, goes generic.\n\nAlongside this, the Cidara deal may highlight the opportunity of investing in biotech companies that have made significant commercialization progress. Two such examples are BioMarin Pharmaceutical(NASDAQ: BMRN) and Nektar Therapeutics(NASDAQ: NKTR).\n\nIs Cidara a buy?\n\nAdmittedly, buying a biotech just on takeover potential alone may not necessarily be a viable investing strategy. It may be best to view such a potential catalyst as \"icing on the cake,\" alongside other catalysts.\n\nHowever, if you are a seasoned investor in biotech and healthcare stocks, well aware of the risk and volatility inherent when investing in this space, you may just well be able to find other potential plays in the making, with the high potential of surging on commercialization progress, or from a deep-pocketed big pharma buyer stepping in with a takeover bid.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cidara Therapeutics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cidara Therapeutics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cidara Therapeutics wasn\u2019t one of them.

Aging populations and the higher incidence of epilepsy in both the very young and elderly are further driving demand for effective therapeutics.\r\n\r\nThe global burden of epilepsy, affecting over 50 million people, continues to drive demand. Regions with increasing awareness and healthcare access, such as Latin America, are particularly contributing to growth as epilepsy is highly prevalent, especially in children.\r\n\r\nHigh demand for paediatric epilepsy care has been observed due to rising incidence rates and population growth.

Should Investors Hop On?", "content": "Hims and Hers Health logo positioned with telehealthcare provider in background.\n\nKey Points\n\nShares of HIMS have seen gains of 173% and 146% this year, but they\u2019ve also seen massive double-digit corrections after each run-up in price.  The company\u2019s management was able to achieve profitability just three years after its IPO. Analysts\u2019 forecast an average 12-month price target nearly 25% higher than where the stock is trading today. Interested in Hims & Hers Health, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nMost of the health care sector's headlines are dominated by Big Pharma giants. Legacy companies, including AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Merck (NYSE: MRK)\u2014and their lineup of game-changing drugs\u2014receive the lion\u2019s share of attention. But one newcomer is making a splash, and investors looking for growth opportunities in the health space should be paying attention.\n\nFounded in November 2017, Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) went public in January 2021. By the end of 2024, the consumer-focused health platform was able to post its first year of profitability, with net income of $126 million.\n\n\u2192 Why Home Depot\u2019s Pain Could Be a Long-Term Investor\u2019s Gain\n\nWhile that figure pales in comparison to mega-cap giants like Pfizer, it demonstrates a level of discipline rarely seen among companies that are less than five years removed from their IPOs. That, combined with operations at the confluence of several high-demand industries, makes Hims & Hers Health an intriguing buy-and-hold prospect.\n\nA Turbulent Year for Shareholders\n\nFundamentally, the young company\u2019s debt management has been exemplary. That has been accentuated by a nearly 244% increase in net cash from operating activities from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\u2192 3 Smart Defensive Stocks for an Uneasy Market\n\nWhen Hims & Hers Health reported Q3 financials on Nov. 3, it missed on earnings by just 3 cents and beat on revenue, with $598.98 million representing a 49.2% year-over-year increase.\n\nIn his comments, CEO and cofounder Andrew Dudum highlighted that \u201cAt the end of the quarter, subscribers using personalized solutions grew 50% year-over-year, helping drive nearly 50% in year-over-year revenue growth.\u201d\n\n\u2192 3 Companies to Watch as Natural Gas Stocks Make a Comeback\n\nMost notably, the company\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio of 1.67 and its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52.79\u2014a marked improvement of its trailing 12-month P/E of 67.33\u2014suggests that earnings next year should grow by more than 79% from 29 cents per share to 52 cents per share.\n\nSince 2021, Hims & Hers Health has averaged annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) growth of 37.14%, revenue growth of 77.85%, and earnings per share (EPS) growth of 169.63%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite these robust fundamentals, 2025 required a strong stomach for shareholders in HIMS. The stock\u2019s performance has been nothing short of a roller coaster ride this year, featuring both meteoric rises and dramatic crashes in rapid succession.\n\nFrom Jan 2. to Feb. 19, HIMS gained nearly 173% before giving more than 63% back by April 22. By May 19, it had gained nearly 146% before plunging 36% lower by June 25. At the end of July, it had regained 60%, and at the time of writing, the stock is down another 45% from that high.\n\nHIMS Is at the Center of Multiple High-Growth Industries\n\nStill, since going public, the stock is up almost 139%. Hims & Hers Health has shown exceptionally strong growth while its management has produced balance sheets that are nothing short of admirable. The company\u2019s accessible, direct-to-consumer telehealth model has positioned it at the intersection of multiple high-growth industries.\n\nAccording to market consultancy firm Grand View Research, the sexual health supplement market is projected to enjoy a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4% from 2024 through 2030.\n\nThe\u00a0hair thinning market\u2019s projected CAGR during the same period is 10.85%, while the telehealth market is expected to grow by a CAGR of 24.68%.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Hims & Hers Health also offers compounded GLP-1 injections, which contain the same ingredients as Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NYSE: NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy.\u00a0The\u00a0GLP-1 weight loss market during that forecast period is projected to be 18.54%.\n\nAdditionally, Dudum noted in the company\u2019s Q3 earnings call that Hims & Hers Health is in ongoing discussions with Novo Nordisk to distribute both injection and oral formulations of Wegovy on the Hims & Hers platform, pending FDA approval.\n\nHere\u2019s What Wall Street Thinks of HIMS\n\nTen of the 15 analysts covering Hims & Hers Health rate it a Hold, and the stock carries a consensus Reduce rating. Still, 15 analysts\u2019\u00a0average 12-month price target is $45.27, which suggests potential upside performance of 24.51%.\n\nHowever, the current level of short interest may give prospective investors pause. That stands at a significant 37.54% of the company\u2019s float. But for those who are considering HIMS as a long-term investment, institutional ownership\u2014which remains strong at nearly 64%\u2014provides a vote of confidence.\n\nUnderscoring the smart money\u2019s bullish stance on Hims & Hers Health, over the past 12 months,\u00a0425 institutional buyers have injected $2.31 billion in inflows, compared to just 194 institutional sellers pulling out $1.17 billion.\n\nThe article \"HIMS Has Been a Roller Coaster Ride.
