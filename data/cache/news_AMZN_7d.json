Its Founders Say They Bootstrapped Their Success", "content": "Twin sisters Taylor Capuano and Casey Sarai found themselves at a crossroads in their careers in 2022. Instead of taking a more traditional route, the women elected to start their own company, Cakes Body, which now does millions in sales each year.\n\nThree years ago, Capuano was a marketing manager at the clothing brand Life Is Good and had just welcomed her first child. Stepping into motherhood left her desiring more flexibility in her working life, she told CNBC. Meanwhile, Sarai was a marketing manager at Pernod Ricard and was struggling with pandemic-era layoffs that had made her job much more difficult.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon \u2014 Invest at $0.86/Share Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors \u2014 Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nBoth women \"desperately needed a path\" forward, Capuano told the outlet. So they decided to take a gamble on starting their own business, feeling that \"there was really nothing to lose.\"\n\nCakes Body's early success\n\nThe pair spent some time brainstorming pain points in their own lives and potential solutions before settling on the idea of producing a new type of silicone nipple cover, they told CNBC. Unlike other silicone nipple covers on the market, theirs would be larger, made of a higher quality silicone that tapered at the edges, and would stick to skin without any potentially irritating adhesive.\n\nOnce they had settled on a prototype they liked, Capuano and Sarai each took $5,000 from their personal savings accounts to invest in the business. They spent the money on 500 units, as well as an online store and social media advertisements.\n\nTrending: Bill Gates Says Climate Change \u2018Needs to Be Solved' \u2014 This Award-Winning Building Material Is Tackling It Head-On\n\nFive months after launch, Cakes Body had its first viral moment when a TikTok hit 1 million views. The viral video helped the sisters sell out their initial stock.\n\n\"It was very exciting and it gave [us] the first glimmer of hope,\" Capuano told CNBC. Still, the sisters were nervous about quitting their full-time jobs, worried that the viral moment wouldn't be sustained. It would take several more rounds of sold-out stock before they both decided to take the plunge, making Cakes Body their full-time gigs.\n\nThe Shark Tank effect\n\nBy the end of their first full year in business, Cakes Body topped $1 million in revenue, a spokesman for the company told CNBC. But the sisters weren't satisfied with that level of success.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo, in 2023, they took their nipple covers to \"Shark Tank,\" where they made a deal with Skims and Good American co-founder Emma Grede. The deal, which saw Grede invest $30,000 in exchange for 10% of the company, valued Cakes Body at $3 million.\n\nGrede's investment is currently the only outside money the company has accepted. \"We just knew: \u2018This is a simple solution that is helping us. I wonder if other people will find it useful,' Capuano told CNBC about the sister's decision to bootstrap their growth instead of taking on outside funding.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate\u2014Get Institutional Access Yourself\n\nThe next chapter\n\nIn its most recent fiscal year, ended in June, Cakes Body brought in $95 million in net sales, a spokesperson told CNBC. Capuano now works full-time as the company's chief creative officer, and Saria is its CEO.\n\nThe sisters told CNBC that their plans for the future include international expansion and continued growth in the brick-and-mortar space. In August, the company launched in Ulta(NASDAQ:ULTA) and is now sold in 1,000 stores around the country.\n\nDespite their initial fears that Cakes Body's success would be fleeting, they encourage others who have a similar dream to take the plunge.\n\n\"There is a moment where you have to take a leap of faith of either ordering the inventory or putting out the first Instagram post,\" Capuano told CNBC. As long as you're product is solving a problem in a market that has room for financial growth, it\u2019s worth plunging ahead, she added.\n\nRead Next: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets \u2014 Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Both Micron and SK Hynix enjoy pricing power and multiyear revenue visibility for their HBM and advanced DRAM offerings. SK Hynix is already the leader in the HBM market, while Micron is focused on expanding its market share. 10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology \u203a\n\nInvestors who are looking for high-potential artificial intelligence (AI) stocks often pick well-known semiconductor players such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, hyperscalers such as Amazon and Microsoft, or software players like Palantir and SoundHound AI.\n\nBut many investors are missing one real AI opportunity that's staring us in the face.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI models continue to get larger and more complex. Additionally, as the systems mature, hyperscalers and enterprises are transitioning from infrequent AI training workloads to more frequent AI inferencing workloads. And now, memory bandwidth and capacity are proving to be bigger bottlenecks than AI computing capacity in large AI clusters.\n\nWithin that dynamic, leading memory players such as MicronTechnology(NASDAQ: MU) and SK Hynix (OTC: HXSCL) -- already crucial players in the global buildout of AI infrastructure -- are well-positioned to prosper.\n\nFavorable memory market trends\n\nThe server clusters built around cutting-edge AI processing chips increasingly require higher-performance, energy-efficient, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced DRAM in order to operate efficiently. In fact, every new generation of AI GPUs uses increasingly more HBM and advanced DRAM.\n\nSo naturally, data center companies are increasing their spending on memory as part of their ongoing AI infrastructure buildouts. The global HBM market is forecast to grow from $17 billion in 2024 to $98 billion in 2030, while HBM's revenue share in the DRAM market is estimated to grow from 18% to 50% in that same time frame. This trend favors Micron and SK Hynix, which stand to benefit from the higher memory content of systems designed to handle large, scalable AI workloads.\n\nMicron and South Korea-based SK Hynix can expect to enjoy solid pricing power and higher margins, as there is currently a chronic shortage of advanced DRAM. According to DigiTimes, many major hyperscalers are securing only 70% of their server DRAM orders, despite accepting 50% price hikes in the fourth quarter.\n\nMicron is capitalizing on this opportunity\n\nU.S.-based Micron has gradually transformed itself from a cyclical DRAM and NAND producer into a full-stack, AI-optimized memory and storage player. The company's performance in its fiscal 2025 (which ended Aug. 28) was impressive, with revenues soaring 49% to $37.4 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share surging nearly 538% to $8.29. Increasing memory demand from data center operators has been the key growth catalyst. In fiscal 2025, its data center business accounted for 56% of Micron's total revenues.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicron's DRAM market share was close to 22.5% in September. Management also forecast that its HBM market share would be similar to its DRAM share in the third quarter of calendar 2025, as it ramps its third-generation extended (HBM3E) and fourth-generation (HBM4) HBM products. That was an achievable goal, considering that Micron was already the second-largest player in the HBM market in the second quarter of calendar 2025, with a 21% share, according to market research firm Counterpoint Research.\n\nMicron's HBM strategy seems to have been quite successful, as its HBM revenues reached nearly $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which translates to an annual run rate of close to $8 billion. The company has already entered into pricing agreements for a significant chunk of its HBM3E supply in 2026, and expects to sell out its entire 2026 supply in the next few months.\n\nThe company is also advancing its technology leadership and has ramped up production of its 1-gamma DRAM node to achieve mature yields 50% faster than the previous-generation process node. The company was the first to ship a 1-gamma DRAM chip and plans to leverage its superior process technology across its entire DRAM portfolio.\n\nSK Hynix remains the leader\n\nWhile Micron is slowly expanding its market share, SK Hynix is already the leader in the HBM market, with a 62% share as of the second quarter of 2025. SK Hynix has also completed development of its next-generation HBM4 and plans to begin shipping that product in the fourth quarter, followed by a rapid scale-up of production in 2026.\n\nSK Hynix has also finalized its 2026 HBM supply plan for major clients, and management expects HBM supply to remain tight even in 2027. As memory companies increasingly allocate production capacity to HBM, the marketplace is now experiencing shortages of some traditional memory products, too. SK Hynix is also a leader in the DRAM market, with a 35% share in the third quarter. Hence, some of its customers have started issuing pre-purchase orders for DRAM and NAND products for 2026.\n\nThe company also delivered exceptional performance in the third quarter, as revenues soared 39% year over year to 24.4 trillion Korean won (about $16.6 billion). Operating profit also rose 62% to an all-time high of 11.4 trillion Korean won (about $7.7 billion).\n\nAI winners\n\nSK Hynix expects the AI memory market to grow by almost 30% annually through 2030. The company is also a key HBM supplier to Nvidia; Micron supplies the GPU leader with smaller HBM volumes.\n\nWith a favorable demand environment for their offerings and strong technological advantages, both Micron and SK Hynix are well positioned to keep capturing a significant share of this growing and profitable market.\n\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

While 83% of companies have reported a positive earnings surprise, it's the revenue growth in Q3 that stands out.\n\nButters notes that S&P 500 companies are reporting the highest revenue growth rate in three years.\n\nIf it holds, the S&P 500's current blended revenue growth rate of 8.4% in Q3 would be the highest mark since Q3 2022, when the index posted a revenue growth rate of 11%.\n\nThe Health Care, Financials, and Consumer Discretionary sectors have led the revenue growth trend, with companies such as Cardinal Health (CAH), Morgan Stanley (MS), Ford (F), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA), among many others, contributing significantly.S&P 500 revenue growth is tracking for the highest level in three years.

However, these huge complexes, which the company owns or operates through long-term leases, do not account for its full footprint. AWS also has server racks in hundreds of so-called colocation facilities, renting space that as of last year provided about a fifth of the computing power at Amazon\u2019s disposal, the report added [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-24/amazon-data-center-tally-tops-900-amid-ai-frenzy-documents-show?srnd=phx-technology].\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.\n\nKnown as \u201ccolos\u201d in the industry, the rented data centers are usually subdivided among different clients. The AWS presence in such facilities ranges from a few server racks in a dedicated room to most or all of massive buildings in places such as Frankfurt and Tokyo, according to the report.\n\nAWS does not disclose the places of individual data centers for security reasons and to keep operational details out of the hands of rivals. The documents indicate Amazon\u2019s cloud computing operations at a time when investors are interested to know if AWS has enough capacity to meet the large computing demands for AI. They also suggest that AWS is one of the world\u2019s largest renters of colo space, indicating that it has the flexibility to offer customers several services worldwide, the report noted.\n\nAs of early 2024, AWS was depending on over 440 colocation data centers. The company also operated from over 220 additional rented \u201cedge\u201d locations, which provide access points to Amazon\u2019s network near major metropolitan areas, often inside telecommunications facilities operated by third parties, the report added.\n\nAmazon's presence at some of these locations is designed to give customers the ability to swiftly route data from their own servers or those of other cloud providers to Amazon\u2019s own infrastructure, as per the report.\n\nAWS spokesperson Aisha Johnson said to the news outlet that Amazon\u2019s approach to data centers \u201cbalances ownership with flexibility,\u201d and was driven by rising demand for AWS services.\n\n\u201cWhile we own and operate the majority of our data centers, we strategically leverage third-party options when they provide additional capacity or geographic reach,\u201d Johnson noted. \u201cThis long-term planning approach allows us to make precise decisions that align with our customers\u2019 evolving requirements.\u201d\n\nAWS is the world\u2019s largest provider of rented computing power, but its leadership position is being challenged by Microsoft (MSFT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT]) and Alphabet's (GOOG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG]) (GOOGL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL]) Google, which have seen their sales soar alongside the launch of AI services.\n\nData center tracker Baxtel puts Amazon\u2019s data center numbers at 449 across 49 markets. Another provider DC Byte places AWS footprint at 364 facilities in 33 countries. Researchers note that tracking Amazon\u2019s full footprint, including colos, is not possible because the agreements between AWS and its landlords are generally private, the report added.\n\nAmazon collaborates with at least 180 different entities in its colocation arrangements, ranging from colo data center operator Equinix to Japanese telecommunications company NTT, and Markley, which operates a data center in Boston, the report noted.\n\nEnvironmental groups and consumer advocates warn that the rapid rate of data center buildout by companies is straining electricity grids and prolonging the life of fossil-fueled power plants.\n\nJohnson noted that other industries, not just data centers, are contributing to rising energy demand, and that the company is investing billions of dollars in carbon-free energy projects, including renewables and nuclear power. \u201cThese investments are designed to add new clean energy to the grid \u2014 helping to meet growing demand while reducing reliance on fossil fuels over time.\" Johnson added.\n\nMORE ON AMAZON\n\n \t* Amazon: Scoop Up This Bargain Hiding In Plain Sight Now [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846170-amazon-scoop-up-bargain-hiding-in-plain-sight-now]\n \t* Amazon: OpenAI Deal Is A Game Changer [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846091-amazon-openai-deal-is-a-game-changer]\n \t* Amazon: Anthropic X Microsoft Deal Changes Nothing [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845632-amazon-anthropic-x-microsoft-deal-changes-nothing]\n \t* SA Asks: Is Tesla losing the robotaxi race to commercialization?

Both indexes are still set for their \u200dbiggest monthly drops since March, with the Nasdaq still down over 6%.\n\nBesides the concerns around AI valuations that drove that selloff in the first place, optimism around a Fed cut doesn't change that October and November's payroll data -- key to rates expectations -- will only be released after the bank's December meeting.\n\nAnd policymakers are split on the path ahead.

Bond buyers are starting to worry about being compensated for the risks of a bubble in the sector, given recent turmoil in tech stocks.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is that a flood of data center financing could cause supply indigestion, particularly in dollars, but with euro markets also absorbing part of the funding needs,\u201d said JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Matthew Bailey.\n\nInvestors are now questioning whether these massive investments in artificial intelligence will pay off. There are no broad signs of panic in credit, with many of the sales so far having come from top-tier names.\n\nAlphabet raised $17.5 billion in the US and \u20ac6.5 billion ($7.5 billion) in Europe, the second-largest corporate deal in the region this year, while Meta sold $30 billion and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) did $18 billion. Demand was huge, with Meta getting a record peak orderbook of $125 billion.\n\nSupply Glut\n\nHedge fund Man Group Plc noted that high-yield firms are also issuing, including former bitcoin miners. These companies\u2019 data center plans come with \u201caggressive deadlines\u201d and a heavy reliance on the supporting lease contracts, it said in a blog post titled \u201cWhy Bond Investors Aren\u2019t Totally Buying the AI Hype.\u201d\n\n\u201cA glut of supply of lower quality names in the AI space might be too much for markets to stomach,\u201d Man Group\u2019s Jon Lahraoui and Hugo Richardson wrote. \u201cThe hyperscaler frenzy continues, but we remain watchful of future AI slop,\u201d they added.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Bailey estimates that Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, (META) Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) alone have capital expenditure needs of around $570 billion for 2026, up from $125 billion back in 2021. Meanwhile UBS Group AG sees total tech debt supply at over $900 billion next year.\n\nLeer m\u00e1s\n\nThe fact that the big players have strong balance sheets and significant capacity to take on debt means they can offer new issue premiums to appeal to investors that other borrowers may be forced to match, Morgan Stanley analysts warned.\n\n\u201cTech issuers have also shown themselves to be less price-sensitive given the strategic importance of these projects \u2014 a dynamic that can still reprice the broader market,\u201d the US bank said in its recent Global Insights outlook report. \u201cLarge issuers who are less sensitive to price is a new dynamic credit markets haven\u2019t contended with for a long time.\u201d\n\nStill Underinvested\n\nSpreads in the corporate bond market have been mostly range bound this year after recovering from the blow out on April\u2019s US tariff announcements. Driving this has been the huge swathes of cash flowing into the asset class, chasing yields at high levels compared to recent years.\n\nFor European investment-grade investors, the rise in issuance from Big Tech and its diversification for the euro market gives an opportunity for exposure that is currently still underrepresented, according to Marco Stoeckle, head of credit strategy at Commerzbank AG.\n\n\u201cEuro investors are essentially underinvested in high quality US tech issuers,\u201d he said. \u201cDemand therefore should not be the main problem as long as credit profiles remain on the right track.\u201d\n\nMonetization Risk\n\nEven with record overall bond supply in Europe this year, it hasn\u2019t been enough to satiate this demand. Next year, global investment-grade bond issuance is seen rising by 3% in euros and 13% in dollars, skewed toward non-financial companies and AI-related spending from tech firms and utilities, HSBC Holdings Plc wrote in its market outlook.\n\nFinancing AI capex is becoming a defining feature of the fixed income world, according to Brandywine Global Investment Managment portfolio manager Tracy Chen. While she likes data center asset-backed securities for stable credit fundamentals and relative insulation from any consumer fragility, she highlighted future monetization risk, or the potential to generate enough revenues.\n\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology initiative this year released a report indicating that 95% of organizations are getting zero return from generative AI projects. Investors and lenders are already hedging their bets by trading more derivatives that offer payouts if individual tech companies default on their debt.\n\n\u201cRefinancing risk and the maturity wall will become more acute if the macro market destabilizes,\u201d Chen said.

Google owner Alphabet sold $25 billion in bonds,\u200c Meta $30 billion, Oracle $18 billion and Amazon, the most recent, $15 billion.\n\nSeveral analysts forecast higher amounts of hyperscaler debt issuance next year as big tech firms race to finance AI-ready data centers.

Keep reading to learn what might be in store.\n\nDecreased Consumer Confidence\n\n\u201cLayoffs first affect consumer confidence in the labor market,\u201d said Kristy Jiayi Xu, MBA, certified financial planner (CFP), certified exit planning advisor (CEPA), founder and financial advisor at Global Wealth Harbor, LLC.\n\nShe said people tend to delay major purchases when they fear their job could be on the line. This is especially true for those that require financing \u2014 such as homes and cars \u2014 as a loan that involves monthly payments could be hard to maintain with a loss of income.\n\nDiscover Next: The Living Wage a Family of 4 Needs in All 50 States\n\nMatt Gagnon, chartered financial analyst (CFA), investment advisor at Financial Empowerment LLC, said this can also create an indirect \u201cheadline effect,\u201d where people read about layoffs and become less optimistic about the economy.\n\n\u201cAs humans we are emotional beings highly susceptible to influence,\u201d he said. \u201cReading or seeing a news story about job losses \u2014 even if our own jobs are safe \u2014 may cause us to imagine being laid off and the associated impacts.\u201d\n\n(Potential) Interest Rate Cuts\n\nWhen people don\u2019t feel secure in their jobs, they tend to become more sensitive to interest rates, Xu said. Therefore, a widespread lack of consumer confidence could lead to lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cFor example, lower rates can reduce monthly mortgage payments and ease financial pressure, which in turn can increase likelihood for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates to support spending and borrowing,\u201d she said.\n\nMajor Economic Slowdown\n\nUnless they have substantial savings, people tend to have less money to spend after losing their job, Gagnon said. Therefore, they typically cut back on discretionary spending like entertainment, travel, dining out, shopping and dry cleaning.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis may lead to a ripple effect that can create a whole new set of issues.\n\n\u201cA sustained decline in consumption reduces overall demand, leading to lower sales and profitability for businesses,\u201d Xu said. \u201cTo protect margins, companies may cut costs or delay investments, reinforcing the broader economic slowdown that began with weaker consumer confidence.\u201d\n\nMore Layoffs\n\nIf business become less profitable, they may be forced to reduce staff, Gagnon said.\n\n\u201cThink about the businesses you buy from every day or every week,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t have your business and that of people like you, they might have to downsize.\u201d\n\nKeep this in mind \u2014 especially if your job is secure \u2014 when deciding which business to patronize, as your money is likely needed at some companies more than others.\n\nEditor\u2019s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

But those sorts of enormous complexes, which the company owns or operates through long-term leases, don\u2019t account for its full footprint. The cloud unit also stashes server racks in hundreds of so-called colocation facilities, renting space that as of last year provided about a fifth of the computing power at Amazon\u2019s disposal, according to the documents.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIndia\u2019s Richest Family Powers\u00a0Push for Green Space in Mumbai San Francisco Hotels That Echoed City\u2019s Decline Sell for 75% Off Where Train\u00a0Dreams Meet Reality in Texas Despite Star Architect\u2019s Alleged Misconduct, New Harlem and Princeton Museums Shine High-Rises\u00a0Are Changing the Slovak Capital of Bratislava Beyond Recognition\n\nCalled \u201ccolos\u201d in the industry, the rented data centers are typically sub-divided among different clients. The AWS presence in such facilities ranges from a few server racks in a dedicated room to most or all of enormous buildings in places like Frankfurt and Tokyo, the documents show.An Amazon Web Services data center in Stone Ridge, Virginia, US.Photographer: Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nAWS doesn\u2019t disclose the locations of individual data centers for security reasons and to keep operational details out of the hands of competitors. The documents shine a light on Amazon\u2019s cloud computing operations at a time when investors are keen for insights into whether AWS has sufficient capacity to meet the enormous computing demands for artificial intelligence. They also show that AWS is one of the world\u2019s largest renters of colo space, suggesting it has the flexibility to offer customers a range of services around the globe.\n\n\u201cThere are big data centers everyone talks about, but the reality is there are also these smaller cloud resources that are invisible,\u201d said Nic Benders, chief technical strategist at New Relic, which helps businesses manage their technology infrastructure. \u201cThe cloud providers do not like to tell you where they are.\u201d\n\nAs of early 2024, AWS was relying on more than 440 colocation data centers. The company also operated from more than 220 additional rented \u201cedge\u201d locations, which provide access points to Amazon\u2019s network near major metropolitan areas, often inside telecommunications hubs operated by third parties. The company\u2019s presence at some of these sites is designed to give customers the ability to quickly route data from their own servers or those of other cloud providers to Amazon\u2019s own infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAWS spokesperson Aisha Johnson said Amazon\u2019s approach to data centers \u201cbalances ownership with flexibility,\u201d and was driven by rising demand for AWS services.\n\n\u201cWhile we own and operate the majority of our data centers, we strategically leverage third-party options when they provide additional capacity or geographic reach,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cThis long-term planning approach allows us to make precise decisions that align with our customers\u2019 evolving requirements.\u201d\n\nAWS is the world\u2019s largest seller of rented computing power, though that leadership position is being tested by rivals like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which have seen their sales surge alongside the rollout of AI services. Still, Amazon\u2019s cloud unit produced $33 billion in revenue in the third quarter and remains the company\u2019s most-profitable division, contributing $11.4 billion in operating income in the period.\n\nFor many people, AWS\u2019 reach became clear last month when a malfunction in a key database service knocked out web sites around the world, an episode that lasted about 15 hours before the company was able to fully restore service.\n\nAmazon has periodically offered clues to the scale of its server farm footprint. In late 2023, then-AWS chief Adam Selipsky said Amazon had three times the number of data centers of its nearest competitor. That\u2019s Microsoft, which at the time was touting a fleet of 300 buildings.\n\nBaxtel, a data center tracker, places Amazon\u2019s footprint at 449 data centers across 49 markets. DC Byte, another provider, pegs the AWS fleet at 364 facilities in 33 countries. Researchers say tracking Amazon\u2019s full footprint \u2014 including colos \u2014 is impossible because the agreements between AWS and its landlords are generally private.\n\nAll told, Amazon partners with at least 180 different entities in its colocation arrangements, the documents show, ranging from colo data center operator Equinix Inc. to Japanese telecommunications giant NTT Inc. and Markley, which operates a data center in Boston.\n\nWhen an AWS customer \u2014 from Netflix Inc. to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u2013 rents computing power from Amazon, they do so from any of 38 regions around the world. Each region is powered by at least three data centers, further dividing Amazon\u2019s network into what the company calls availability zones.\n\nAmazon\u2019s preference, industry analysts say, is to own facilities or operate them on long-term leases, particularly in the US, its most important market. After 20 years of operating data centers, the company believes it can operate the facilities more efficiently than partners. AWS owns about 24 million square feet of buildings. It leases roughly the same amount, according to the company\u2019s annual report.\n\nBut Amazon also taps into space from third parties, especially when setting up shop in new areas or trying to quickly respond to changes in demand. The company has been racing in recent years to keep up with rising use of its services, both to support businesses migrating their software to Amazon\u2019s servers and meet new demand to train and power AI services. In China, local laws require the company to sell its services alongside a joint venture partner.\n\nLooking at electricity consumption \u2013 a measure of the intensity of computing use inside a facility \u2013 some of AWS\u2019 biggest colocation data centers are in or on the outskirts of major cities, the documents show. That includes facilities in and around Frankfurt, Montreal, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo.\n\nExplainer: How the Data Center Boom Tests Grids, Capital Markets\n\nEnvironmental groups and consumer advocates have warned that the rapid data center buildout by Amazon and its biggest rivals is straining electricity grids and prolonging the life of fossil-fueled power plants. Amazon has been the biggest corporate backer of renewable energy projects in recent years, one element of its aim to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. At the same time, its megaprojects in places like Indiana and Mississippi are helping spur the construction of new natural gas plants.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Johnson said other industries \u2014 not just data centers \u2014 are contributing to rising energy demand, and that the company is investing billions of dollars in carbon-free energy projects, including renewables and nuclear power. \u201cThese investments are designed to add new clean energy to the grid \u2014 helping to meet growing demand while reducing reliance on fossil fuels over time,\u201d she said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPermabull Tom Lee Sees Bitcoin as High as $200,000 by January\u2019s End The Dirty Secret of Biodegradable Plastic Weed Drinks That Get You Very, Very High Could Be Gone Soon Cutting Ties With China Is Harder Than Companies Expected The New Requirement for MBAs Seeking Consulting Jobs: AI Proficiency\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-data-center-tally-tops-110000218.html", "symbols": ["1AMZN.MI", "AMZ.DU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.HM", "AMZ.MU", "AMZ1.F", "AMZN.BA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.SN", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "MSFT.US"], "tags": ["AI", "CLOUD-COMPUTING", "DATA-CENTERS", "OPERATING INCOME", "RENEWABLE-ENERGY", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.901, "pos": 0.081}}, {"date": "2025-11-24T11:00:00+00:00", "title": "3 Genius Stocks Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Just Bought", "content": "Key Points\n\nAmazon's stock performance has lagged its peers in 2025. Meta Platforms has fallen since Druckenmiller bought it in Q3. MercadoLibre is a great way to gain international exposure. 10 stocks we like better than Amazon \u203a\n\nKeeping tabs on what billionaire hedge fund managers are doing is considered by some to be a great way to initiate investment ideas. While you shouldn't blindly follow what these hedge funds are doing with their investments because every investor has different goals for their portfolio, it can be a good strategy check to make sure you aren't missing out on a good thing.\n\nAs for different goals, it's important to remember that hedge funds tend to invest with an idea of holding a stock for 12 to 18 months, on average. Another reason for investors to do their own due diligence about a potential investment sourced from a hedge fund report is that there is a significant delay between when the stock was purchased and when the report is released. Any fund with greater than $100 million in assets must disclose its trades during the quarter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a Form 13F. That information is then released to the public 45 days after the end of the quarter. So, moves that these hedge funds may have made during Q3 could have happened as long as 135 days prior to release. Plenty could have happened for the company and the stock since then\n\nStill, even after factoring in those parameters, I think the stocks that Stanley Druckenmiller at Duquesne Family Office purchased during Q3 are worthy buys right now. Here are my thoughts on three of them.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nDruckenmiller opened a position in Q3 on Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). He's had an on-again, off-again relationship with Amazon, as he previously owned shares during Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. He purchased 437,000 shares of Amazon during Q3, which is valued at nearly $100 million right now. The stock makes up about 2.4% of his total portfolio value, so it's not an insignificant bet.\n\nAmazon has delivered strong results throughout 2025, yet it has lagged behind its peers in stock price performance. Druckenmeiller's bet could be on Amazon reemerging as a top investment pick, which wouldn't surprise me considering how strong Amazon's business looked during Q3.\n\nDuring 2025's Q3, Amazon's e-commerce business grew at an impressive 10% pace year over year. This is a rare feat, because over the past few quarters, this growth rate has been around the high single digits. The bigger growth drivers of Amazon's business continue to be its advertising service and cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Both of these divisions grew revenue at their fastest pace in over a year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmazon is an excellent stock pick and is primed to go on a strong run in 2026 if its business can maintain its current trajectory. Druckenmiller is hoping to tap into that.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) looks a lot different now in Q4 than it did during the third quarter. After it reported its Q3 earnings in late October, the stock dropped like a rock.Data by YCharts.\n\nThis means that Druckenmiller's brand new, $56 million position in Meta Platforms is very likely losing money for him right now. The drop occurred because of investors' concern regarding guidance for increased data center capital expenditure to help boost its artificial intelligence capabilities. These raised capital expenditures have investors worried that the investments won't pay off, and are giving some investors flashbacks to the company's metaverse-related spending spree during 2022.\n\nWhile I think AI has a far more relevant use case than the metaverse ever did, this spending has many investors concerned that it might outpace Meta's cash flows and require added debt. The concerns, however, overshadowed Meta's excellent Q3 results, which saw revenue grow 26% year over year on the back of strong advertising growth on its social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.\n\nI think this short-sighted thinking by the market provides investors with an excellent buying opportunity right now on what has become a discounted stock, and they can be confident that Meta will be a winning stock pick over the next few years, as it may take some time for the market to regain confidence in Meta after its AI spending spree is over.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nLast is MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI). MercadoLibre is a dominant force in Latin America and has a massive market share in e-commerce and payment processing in that region of the world. It has been a long-term successful stock pick, and is a great way to diversify away from U.S. markets and anything AI-centric.\n\nMercadoLibre is already a fairly large holding for Druckenmiller, and it accounts for about 3.5% of his portfolio. Druckenmiller only added 4,600 shares during Q3, increasing his position by about 9%. With MercadoLibre still trading down from recent highs, I think this is another smart stock to add to, as it has a long track record of success and is a great diversification investment for investors of all types.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

But now the stock sports a low valuation and impressive dividend yield. Are the company's negative headwinds finally priced into the shares? 10 stocks we like better than United Parcel Service \u203a\n\nOn the surface, United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) doesn't look like the type of company you would expect to struggle. Founded in 1907 and going public in 1999, the Atlanta-based logistics giant is a ubiquitous presence in America's package delivery market -- an opportunity that continues to expand as more people turn to online shopping.\n\nBut while the overall opportunity is expanding, UPS is seeing its market share slowly erode as competition intensifies. Shares have dropped an alarming 44% over the last five years. Let's dig deeper to see if this dip is a buying opportunity or the start of an even longer-term decline.\n\nWhat went wrong for UPS?\n\nWhen UPS went public roughly 26 years ago, it was the largest initial public offering (IPO) in the world with a starting valuation of $60.2 billion. Over the next two decades, the company benefited from the rising popularity of online shopping as e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay drove up the volume of small parcel shipments to residential households.\n\nUPS outcompeted public sector delivery services like the United States Postal Service (USPS) because of its focus on higher-value shipments, air cargo capability, and large corporate accounts, which relied on its networks to deliver all or most of their packages.\n\nHowever, this business model began to unravel as Amazon started investing in building out its own logistics network, rerouting its less desirable traffic to third parties. In response, UPS' leadership began to rethink its relationship with the retailer. Despite high volumes, these packages generate little profit.\n\nUPS' management plans to shrink its Amazon delivery volumes by over 50% by the second half of 2026 as it aims to pivot to better opportunities. However, many investors are reacting to the move with alarm because it will lead to substantial downsizing, slower growth, and potentially fewer economies-of-scale advantages, which are crucial in logistics.\n\nUPS' earnings remain weak\n\nWhile the full impact of UPS' partial divorce from Amazon is yet to be seen, the company's financial results leave much to be desired. Third-quarter U.S. domestic revenue dropped by 2.6% year over year to $14.2 billion, driven by an expected drop in volume, while the segment's operating profits fell 28% to $603 million. Consolidated financial results (which include the international segment and supply chain solutions) aren't faring much better, with revenue down 3.7% to $21.4 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nManagement sees the near-term weakness as a temporary setback as it executes a longer-term pivot to higher-margin opportunities like healthcare logistics, where clients are willing to pay higher prices for more specialized service.\n\nUPS has dramatically expanded its footprint in this niche, renting out 100,000 square feet of laboratory space in Louisville, Kentucky, to let medical companies set up shop near its central air cargo hub. The proximity allows them to quickly deliver samples, test results, and medication to residential consumers around the country.\n\nWhile UPS is investing in healthcare, it is downsizing the other parts of its business -- cutting a whopping 48,000 jobs since last year, with the majority of layoffs affecting drivers and warehouse workers.\n\nIs UPS stock a buy?\n\nThe most attractive thing about UPS stock right now is the dividend, which offers an impressive yield of 7.07%, trouncing the S&P 500 average of 1.17%. The payout has been increased every year for 16 years, which suggests management is relatively committed to the program. And with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 12.6, the stock is remarkably affordable compared to the market's estimate of 22.\n\nHowever, when you zoom out, you realize that sometimes a big dividend is just not enough. UPS went public at a market value of $60.2 billion. Twenty-six years later, the company is worth just $79 billion, a gain of only 31% over two-and-a-half decades. And that's not even including inflation. Investors will probably enjoy a better total return by buying an index fund.\n\nShould you buy stock in United Parcel Service right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and United Parcel Service wasn\u2019t one of them.

The Trade Desk has fallen sharply amid concerns about competition with Amazon, but it has an important advantage in its independent business model, and the stock looks cheap. Chipotle has struggled with economic headwinds this year, but the brand has historically resonated with consumers, and the stock\u2019s valuation is reasonable. 10 stocks we like better than The Trade Desk \u203a\n\nThe Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) are among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) year to date. The former is down 66%, and the latter is down 48% in 2025, but most Wall Street analysts view the stocks as oversold.\n\nAmong 44 analysts, The Trade Desk has an average target price of $62.60 per share. That implies 56% upside from its current share price of $40. Among 38 analysts, Chipotle has an average target price of $43 per share. That implies 36% upside from its current share price of $31.60.\n\nForecasts from Wall Street suggest these stocks are no-brainer buys ahead of 2026, and both stocks are priced at less than $50 per share.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Trade Desk: 56% implied upside\n\nThe Trade Desk is the leading demand-side platform (DSP) for the open internet. A DSP is a type of adtech software that helps brands plan, measure, and optimize campaigns across digital channels. The open internet refers to the network of websites and applications not controlled by tech giants like Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google, often referred to as walled gardens due to their extensive control over advertising supply chains within their own ecosystems.\n\nThe Trade Desk has an important advantage in its independence. It does not own media content or advertising inventory that could bias spending on its platform. Not only does that remove conflicts of interest inherent to Meta and Google, but it also means publishers are more likely to share data because The Trade Desk is not a competitor. Consequently, the company says it has the best campaign measurement tools on the market.\n\nHowever, the stock has fallen sharply because investors are worried about intensifying competition with Amazon. The Trade Desk is the most popular DSP for the open internet, and the company dominates connected TV (CTV) advertising. But Amazon recently struck deals to access advertising inventory from Roku and Netflix, and it introduced artificial intelligence (AI) tools that could help it take share in other areas of the open web.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Trade Desk's CEO, Jeff Green, attempted to quell those concerns on the latest earnings call. He said Amazon is not a direct competitor in open internet advertising because it has a clear incentive to prioritize its own inventory on its marketplace and Prime Video, adding, \"The open internet offers a compelling value in contrast to walled gardens. The open internet is where most consumers spend most of their time.\"\n\nI believe the market is overreacting to Amazon's recent moves, making the stock's decline this year a compelling opportunity for investors. Despite downward revisions, Wall Street still expects The Trade Desk's adjusted earnings to increase at 15% annually through 2028, which makes the current valuation of 22 times earnings look quite fair, if not cheap.\n\nInvestors should never lean too heavily on target prices, but I think The Trade Desk could generate 50%-plus returns for shareholders in the next year, provided the economy continues to grow and the competitive landscape remains similar. But even if that doesn't happen, now is a good time to buy a few shares.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill: 36% implied upside\n\nChipotle owns more than 3,900 fast-casual restaurants across North America and Europe. The company has built a reputable brand by focusing on \"food with integrity.\" It exclusively sources responsibly raised meats never treated with hormones or antibiotics, and uses only organically grown produce and fresh ingredients. That means no preservatives, freezers, or can openers are involved in food preparation.\n\nThat strategy has resonated with consumers. In the past, Chipotle has regularly reported strong increases in same-store sales and customer traffic, often substantially outpacing competitors. However, the company has stumbled this year due to challenging economic conditions caused by increased student loan repayments, a difficult jobs market, and inflation created by President Trump's tariffs.\n\nIn the first and second quarters, same-store sales and customer traffic actually declined. In the third quarter, same-store sales returned to growth, increasing 0.3%, but customer traffic still dropped 0.8%. Those numbers are marginally better than the industry average, according to the National Restaurant Association, but the market has nonetheless been disappointed.\n\nHowever, I think investors are overly pessimistic, and the recent drawdown creates a good buying opportunity. The Trump administration recently rolled back tariffs on imported beef and avocados, which should benefit Chipotle. And Wall Street expects Chipotle's earnings to increase at 12% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 27 times earnings look reasonable.\n\nI think shareholders could see 30%-plus gains in the next year, provided the economic backdrop does not worsen.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

Historical headwinds, such as the astronomical price-to-sales ratios of quantum computing stocks, are front and center for investors.

But in 2025, it's taken a back seat to a technology that's produced truly jaw-dropping gains.\n\nOver the trailing year, as of the closing bell on Nov. 19, quantum computing pure-play stocksIonQ(NYSE: IONQ), Rigetti Computing(NASDAQ: RGTI), D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT) have delivered respective returns of 90%, 1,860%, 1,530%, and 385%. For comparison, the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite has rallied 20% over the trailing year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nGains of this magnitude imply that investor hype surrounding quantum computing is tangible and may not fade anytime soon. While there are viable reasons to be excited about the real-world applications of Wall Street's hottest innovation, the biggest risk of all to this quartet of quantum computing stocks has gone virtually undetected by the investing populace.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did quantum computing stocks go parabolic in 2025?\n\nIn simple terms, quantum computing involves the use of specialized computers that can make rapid, simultaneous calculations at a considerably faster pace than the world's quickest supercomputers. Quantum computers are capable of tackling complex problems that classical computers are ill-equipped to handle.\n\nOne example of the real-world utility of quantum computers is their ability to speed up the real-time processing and learning capabilities of AI algorithms. Split-second decision-making is particularly important for AI software and systems.\n\nInvestors have also been enamored with the high ceiling for quantum computing hardware and services. Boston Consulting Group estimates this technology can add $450 billion to $850 billion to the global economy by 2040. Meanwhile, online publication The Quantum Insider is looking for this worldwide economic impact to reach the $1 trillion plateau by 2035.\n\nBut if there's one tangible factor that's really lit a fire under the shares of IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. in recent months, it's the prospect of brand-name collaborations.\n\nFor instance, \"Magnificent Seven\" members Amazon and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are both giving their respective quantum-cloud service subscribers access to IonQ's and Rigetti's quantum computers. Amazon's Braket and Microsoft's Azure Quantum can allow clients to run simulations and test their quantum computing hardware.\n\nAdditionally, quantum computing pure-play stocks soared following an Oct. 13 announcement from banking giant JPMorgan Chase that it plans to make direct equity and venture capital investments in 27 \"sub-areas.\" Quantum computing was one of these 27 investment targets identified by JPMorgan's initial research.\n\nAlthough everything would seem to be going swimmingly for quantum computing pure-play stocks, their parabolic ascent may prove fleeting.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis under-the-radar risk threatens to wipe out the first-mover advantage of pure-play stocks\n\nHistory tells us there are several reasons to be skeptical of the supercharged returns for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc.\n\nTo begin with, every hyped technology and game-changing innovation since the arrival of the internet in the mid-1990s has eventually navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly an innovation or trend would earn widespread adoption, gain utility, and/or be optimized. This eventually leads to lofty investor expectations not being met.\n\nQuantum computing is still in the very early stages of commercialization, which exposes it to a high risk of a bubble-bursting event.\n\nFurthermore, quantum computing stock valuations are otherworldly. Whereas price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 in market-leading businesses have historically alerted investors to potential stock market bubbles, the forward-year P/S ratios for IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. are many multiples above this historical mark.\n\nBut there's an even bigger risk to these four quantum computing stocks that virtually everyone is missing. Namely, some of their leading clients could become their top competitors in the years to come.\n\nWith the exception of electric-vehicle maker Tesla, whose operating cash flow has fluctuated in recent quarters, the other six members of the Magnificent Seven are flush with capital and generating more cash flow from their operating activities than they often know what to do with. When a game-changing innovation emerges with an eye-popping addressable market, companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)seize the opportunity.\n\nIn December 2024, Alphabet introduced the world to Willow, the company's latest quantum processing unit (QPU). Last month (October), Alphabet reported that Willow oversaw calculations that were approximately 13,000 times faster than the fastest classical supercomputers on the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, in February, Microsoft announced the arrival of Majorana 1, which is its take on a QPU. Microsoft claims that Majorana 1 is designed to scale to 1 million qubits, which is expected to significantly minimize errors while ensuring calculations that are considerably faster than those of classical computers.\n\nThe point being that we're already observing some of Wall Street's most influential, profitable, and cash-rich businesses encroaching on an industry where the first-mover advantage for IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc. may be precarious, at best. Although IonQ recently completed a $2 billion equity offering, the funding situation for most pure-play quantum computing stocks remains uncertain. Trying to compete against the likes of Alphabet or Microsoft with no foundational operating segment and ongoing cash outflows is a recipe for disaster.\n\nWhile several headwinds exist for quantum computing pure-play stocks, internal competition from members of the Magnificent Seven represents the most significant risk to their success -- and perhaps even their survival.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

If you take the right approach to finding bargains during the sale, this can be a fantastic opportunity to save money on Christmas presents and special gifts for yourself. However, if you fall foul of the deadly Black Friday mistakes, you can end up wasting hundreds of pounds.\n\nIt's not our fault that it\u2019s so easy to overspend on the day. There\u2019s a whole industry devoted to getting us to part with our money, and they have a number of dastardly tricks up their sleeves. It\u2019s worth knowing what retailers are up to, so you can protect yourself.\n\nMaking you think the event is unmissable\n\nYou may already have been hoodwinked by a couple of their sales techniques. Retailers have been sending emails and posting endlessly on social media about the fabulous bargains on offer.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just them helpfully letting you know about deals. They\u2019re repeatedly sending you the message that this event is unmissable. It can make you feel you have to join in and buy something, even if there\u2019s nothing you really need.\n\nRead more: 15 ways to save money when you're single\n\nPushing deals out early\n\nAnother common tactic is to push out deals early, and then provide an extra discount on the day. They\u2019re hoping that the excitement as the clock ticks down to Friday will prove too much, and you\u2019ll buy before their deepest discounts are unveiled.If you fall foul of the deadly Black Friday mistakes, you can end up wasting hundreds of pounds.\u00b7Richard Baker via Getty Images\n\nTaking advantage that you may not shop around\n\nIf you wait for the day itself, take care not to be drawn in by another technique where they have a limited number of items on sale, sometimes only for a very short period of time. This creates the idea of scarcity, so we rush into making a purchase without shopping around or giving it enough thought.\n\nSome retailers will take advantage of the fact we\u2019re in a hurry so may not shop around. They\u2019ll charge more for an item for a period before Black Friday, and then mark it up with a big discount on the day. It means they can offer a huge price cut \u2013 and yet it might still be cheaper elsewhere.\n\nShifting old stock\n\nOthers will take the opportunity to shift old stock. If you\u2019re not desperate for the latest version, it\u2019s a great chance to save by buying an old model. However, don\u2019t fall into the trap of comparing prices against those of something newer. Check exactly what\u2019s on sale.\n\nPursuading you to trade up\n\nThe other risk is that you\u2019re persuaded to trade up, because they\u2019re offering a deal on the luxury model. If you need something top-of-the-range, then this is a saving, but if you were perfectly happy with the basic model, you could end up paying more for features you\u2019ll never use.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from all of these risks is to go in with a game plan. Make a list of everything you definitely need \u2013 either for yourself or as Christmas presents. If it\u2019s a gadget or technology, make a note of the model you\u2019re after or the features you need.\n\nRead more: Why shorter days are bad for your finances\n\nThen shop around and work out what constitutes a good price for it. For Amazon (AMZN), the camel camel camel website, which is a free price-tracker, is your best option. For other sites, you can use PriceSpy.\n\nThen on the day, if it\u2019s not available, or it\u2019s not a bargain, don\u2019t convince yourself to pick something else up instead.

Amazon Web Services revenue was up 20% in the third quarter. Taiwan Semiconductor is now making Nvidia Blackwell chips in Arizona.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet \u203a\n\nIf you're heavily invested in tech stocks, you've surely heard concerns that we may be approaching (or in) a bubble. Similar to the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and the housing bubble in the early 2000s, tech stocks are on fire, and some bears believe they are overheated today.\n\nIs that true? I think the concern is overstated, but it's also important to acknowledge that markets sometimes drop. Corrections are nothing new and are, in fact, part of the heartbeat of the stock market. The S&P 500 has experienced corrections of 10% or more dozens of times over the last 60 years, and each time it has recovered, dusted itself off, and moved on.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nSo, if you're looking at tech stocks today and wondering how you can avoid a market pullback, the reality is: You can't. But that's OK. You should instead look at the long-term picture and choose stocks that are stable, have plenty of resources, and are able to resume their winning ways after an inevitable correction.\n\nTech stocks are too good to ignore. Here are three great tech stocks to buy today and hold for the long term.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is quietly having a very good year -- recovering from a downturn in the first half of the year to register gains of more than 50%. Alphabet stock is down just 3% from its all-time high and will roll into 2026 at the peak of its powers.\n\nIts problems at the beginning of the year were primarily legal in nature. The Department of Justice accused Google of unfair practices regarding its search and advertising businesses, which it said created an illegal monopoly.  The issue hung over Alphabet stock as investors worried that the company would be forced to sell off its Chrome browser or another equally lucrative business.\n\nHowever, a federal judge finally ruled this year that wouldn't be the case, and now Alphabet can continue to operate, although it must share search data with its competitors and stop issuing exclusive distribution contracts.  The market rightly viewed that as merely a slap on the wrist, and Alphabet stock shot higher.\n\nToday, the company is operating at full capacity, generating $102.34 billion in revenue during the third quarter. Advertising revenue, which makes up 72% of Alphabet's revenue, was up 12.6%. In addition, Google Cloud revenue increased 33.5% to $15.15 billion, indicating that the company's efforts to expand its computing capacity are yielding results.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nShould you consider Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) a retail stock or a cloud computing stock? Well, it's both -- and it's probably the best in both of those markets. That makes Amazon stock a powerful name for investors to keep in their portfolio now and into 2026.\n\nAmazon's revenue in the third quarter was $180.16 billion, up 13.4% from a year ago. Most of the company's revenue comes from its e-commerce division, which generated $147.16 billion in sales, a 12% increase from last year.\n\nBut the profit margin for Amazon's e-commerce division is a paltry 4.1%. Therefore, investors are more interested in Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest cloud provider with a 29% market share. AWS revenue in the third quarter was $33 billion, up 20% from the same period last year, and it provided a profit margin of 34.6%.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce division makes it a part of our daily lives, and AWS is becoming a massive profit center. Both make Amazon a compelling tech stock to buy now.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.(NYSE: TSM) plays a key role in today's tech-driven world. It's the largest fabricator of semiconductor chips and plays a leading role in creating the high-performance chips that companies require to power AI and large language models (LLMs).\n\nTSMC, as it's known, generates 60% of its revenue from producing 3nm and 5nm chips, which have become increasingly important as chip manufacturers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices strive to build chips with smaller nodes, thereby achieving faster and more efficient performance.\n\nTSMC has been investing heavily in the U.S., including $165 billion to build and expand production facilities in Arizona. The company announced that the Arizona foundries are starting to produce Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which provide more processing power and greater performance than the famed Hopper line.\n\nThree tech stocks to buy now\n\nAI is only going to get bigger -- and if there's a correction, history tells us the market will recover and make up lost ground rapidly. No matter what chatbots, LLMs, or software comes down the line in the next few years, it will need AI infrastructure to power it, and Alphabet, Amazon, and Taiwan Semiconductor are ideally situated.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon are leading cloud computing companies that also have massive competitive moats in internet services and e-commerce, respectively. And Taiwan Semiconductor's foundry business is poised for success for years to come as companies seek to create better and more powerful chips.\n\nTogether, they form a formidable trio that can anchor any portfolio in November and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

The applications of the technology are still in the very early innings, as is the buildout of the infrastructure needed to test large language models (LLMs) and run AI inference.\n\nLet's look at three stocks set to be AI winners that you can buy and hold onto for the next decade.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest AI winners thus far, but that doesn't mean it won't continue to be a long-term winner. The company's graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of the infrastructure buildout to help power AI applications. As companies rush to create their own AI applications, demand for Nvidia's chips has been through the roof.\n\nTo maintain its lead in the space, Nvidia has sped up its innovation cycle, and it is looking to introduce new chip architecture on an accelerated schedule. At the same time, the company's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform is a differentiator for the company and has helped it create a wide moat. The software platform is generally what developers are taught on to program GPUs, helping make Nvidia's chips and software platform the industry standard.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts\n\nDespite the stock's strong performance, Nvidia still trades at an attractive valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 30 based on 2025 analyst estimates. Given its growth potential, that is a bargain.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nDon't let the slide in Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) stock following its second-quarter results fool you. The company posted strong results that show it is set to become an AI winner.\n\nThe company's cloud computing segment, Google Cloud, is making great strides, seeing Q2 revenue growth of 29% to $10.4 billion, as the segment benefits from developers using its AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. Importantly, though, this is a very fixed-cost business where the company has just gained the necessary scale. As such, profitability is starting to soar, with Q2 operating income going from $395 million a year ago to $1.2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the fears that AI could negatively impact Google Search have thus far been unfounded, with the company seeing search revenue jump 14% last quarter. Alphabet is just beginning to tap into the power of AI with its search, developing AI overlays to answer some queries. After some initial hiccups, users are beginning to engage with the new feature, and the company is in the early days of monetizing (profiting from) these AI overviews. The company plans to introduce new search and shopping ads with the format soon.\n\nGOOGL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts\n\nTrading at a forward P/E of under 20 based on 2025 analyst estimates, the stock is one of the cheapest mega-cap tech stocks out there and a great stock to buy and hold for the long term.\n\n3. Adobe\n\nWhile chip stocks related to building out AI infrastructure have been the big early AI winners, software companies have the potential to be strong AI winners as well. One such company embracing AI and leading the charge is Abobe(NASDAQ: ADBE), which holds a dominant position in the creative software space with programs such as Photoshop and InDesign. It is also the leading PDF solution company through its Acrobat programs.\n\nThe company has been pushing the use of AI into its products, with such AI features as generative fill, text to image, generative shape fill, and generative remove, using the Firefly AI models that it has developed. Adobe is still in the early days of monetizing AI, as right now, it lets users trial its AI capabilities for free before they have to buy generative credits. The company should find a better to way to profit from its AI capabilities in the future, but right now, it is helping drive solid growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's AI-powered Adobe Express app, which helps create graphics and videos for social media, looks like it could be a long-term AI winner. Social media is obviously a big business, and such a tool has a lot of potential. Adobe launched an all-new version of the Express app early last quarter and saw monthly active users double quarter over quarter as a result.\n\nAdobe's Document Cloud segment, home to Acrobat, meanwhile, drove some of its best growth last quarter, with revenue for the segment up 19% to $782 million in fiscal Q2. The results were powered by the introduction of its Acrobat AI assistant add-on subscription.\n\nADBE PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts\n\nAdobe trades at a reasonable forward P/E of under 26 based on fiscal 2025 estimates, and the stock looks poised to be a longer-term winner investors can buy and hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Amazon's cloud computing and advertising are driving a new wave of growth. Taiwan Semiconductor's chip-making services are in high demand in the AI arms race. 10 stocks we like better than Alphabet \u203a\n\nIdentifying stocks that you can buy and hold for the next decade is a great goal for every investor. These low-maintenance stocks can deliver excellent returns and hardly require any attention.\n\nHowever, they aren't easy to identify because they require you to understand what will happen over the next 10 years. If you rewind the clock a decade, many events, like the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), cryptocurrency, and the COVID-19 pandemic, were difficult or impossible to predict. So, there is a bit of luck involved.\n\nHowever, I think these three are easily stocks that will outperform the market over the next decade, and they're using AI to do it.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) was supposed to be one of the victims of the artificial intelligence arms race. However, it has proven that it's a force to be reckoned with. Its primary business is the Google Search engine, which was supposed to be replaced by various generative AI products.\n\nGoogle has integrated AI search overviews, which seamlessly combine AI and traditional search. This has been a wildly successful combination, and has led to impressive 15% year-over-year growth during Q3 for this mature business.\n\nGemini has emerged as a top generative AI model, which secures Alphabet's AI future. Furthermore, Alphabet is also thriving in the cloud computing realm, which is providing computing power to AI and non-AI clients alike. This segment grew revenue at a 34% year-over-year pace during Q3, and shows no signs of slowing down. This wing can provide massive growth for Alphabet, as there is a general shift to the cloud in regular business workloads on top of all the new AI workloads coming online.\n\nAlphabet is here to stay, and it has several other technologies, such as quantum computing and self-driving cars (Waymo), in its back pocket. I think this future-proofs Alphabet, making it an excellent stock to buy and hold over the next decade.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nInvestors may only think of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as the sprawling commerce business where nearly anything can be purchased. While this isn't a wrong perspective, Amazon is so much more than that, and its most impressive divisions aren't what consumers traditionally think of when they hear about Amazon.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTwo of Amazon's most exciting segments are its advertising services and cloud computing. Amazon is sitting on a gold mine of advertising information because consumers come to their website to shop for products.\n\nThis gives Amazon Prime advertising space, and this division has been a huge growth driver for Amazon over the past few years. In Q3, ad revenue rose 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. That makes it about a fourth the size of Amazon's online store segment, showcasing how big a deal this has become for Amazon.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is benefiting from the same tailwinds as Google Cloud, but because most of Amazon's business is low margin, it makes up a greater portion of Amazon's operating margins. Without AWS, Amazon's profits wouldn't look the same, as 66% of Amazon's operating profits came from AWS during Q3. With AWS growing at an impressive 20% pace and expected to sustain that growth for some time, the future looks bright for Amazon.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nLast is Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest chip foundry by revenue, and nearly every company that has an AI computing unit utilizes TSMC chips. This places Taiwan Semi in a neutral position in the AI arms race, as it doesn't care if it's selling chips to Nvidia, AMD, or Google with its custom AI chips (tensor processing units).\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor also has innovative technology on the way. Its 2nm (nanometer) chips consume about 25% to 30% less power than the previous 3nm chip generation. This efficiency gain is a huge deal because we're starting to run into a power crunch for AI data centers. However, that's not the only technology Taiwan Semiconductor has in the pipeline.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's continual innovation will ensure that it always has a market to sell to. While it may go through ups and downs over the next decade, the peaks are always higher than the valleys, which makes Taiwan Semiconductor a great stock to buy now and hold over the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company recently introduced NVQLink to connect quantum and classical computers. Nvidia is following a familiar pick-and-shovel strategy with quantum computing that has worked very well with AI. 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia \u203a\n\nBack in California's gold rush in the mid-1800s, thousands of individuals flocked to the region hoping to find gold and strike it rich. However, the easy money was instead made by the suppliers who sold tools to the gold prospectors.\n\nToday, the term \"pick-and-shovel investing\" honors that legacy. Oftentimes, providers of ancillary products and services achieve greater success than pure-play companies do.\n\nCould this be the case with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the quantum computing market? Maybe so. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nSimulation paves the way for reality\n\nSeveral companies are racing to develop large-scale quantum computers that can be utilized in a wide range of practical applications. They include tech giants such as Google Quantum AI parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) as well as rising stars like D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). However, Nvidia isn't in this group.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Nvidia doesn't have a vested interest in quantum computing, though. And the chipmaker doesn't have to wait for quantum computing to fulfill its potential to make money, either.\n\nResearchers must develop simulations of quantum systems to design and test algorithms and circuits. However, access to quantum processing units (QPUs) today is limited and expensive. Nvidia recognized this challenge and offers a solution: Use its graphics processing units (GPUs) on classical computers for quantum simulation.\n\nNvidia Quantum Cloud supports quantum simulation using the company's GPUs and its CUDA-Q quantum computing platform. Roughly 75% of organizations deploying QPUs use CUDA-Q.\n\nThree of the four largest cloud service providers have integrated Nvidia Quantum Cloud into their platforms: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) Cloud Infrastructure. The notable exception is Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, AWS allows QPU developers to use Nvidia's CUDA-Q.\n\nNvidia's bridge to the future\n\nNvidia's quantum opportunities aren't limited to simulation. The likelihood is that most practical quantum computers will be hybrid systems that connect QPUs with classical supercomputers for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe problem is that qubits (the basic units of information in quantum computers) are notoriously unwieldy, at least for now. Because they're prone to errors, complex calibration processes and control algorithms are required to keep them on track. Nvidia is addressing this challenge in two ways.\n\nFirst, the company's GPUs are ideally suited for powering the supercomputers needed in hybrid quantum-classical systems. Second, Nvidia has developed a low-latency, high-throughput bridge between QPUs and its GPUs called NVQLink.\n\nNvidia found and CEO Jensen Huang describes NVQLink as \"the Rosetta Stone connecting quantum and classical supercomputers.\" He recently predicted, \"In the near future, every Nvidia GPU scientific supercomputer will be hybrid, tightly coupled with quantum processors to expand what is possible with computing.\"\n\nA familiar path\n\nMaking money as a pick-and-shovel play in quantum computing should be relatively straightforward for Nvidia. The company has successfully navigated a similar path in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOpenAI, Google, and others have developed powerful large language models (LLMs). Many of these companies are also pioneering agentic AI and working on artificial general intelligence (AGI) and AI superintelligence (ASI). Nvidia opted not to compete on their turf. Instead, it's supporting them with the chips and software tools that make their jobs easier.\n\nIn many respects, Nvidia's strategy in quantum computing mirrors the approach it has taken with AI. With the company generating revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025 and projecting revenue of $65 billion next quarter, Nvidia's AI strategy is paying off handsomely. I think supplying the picks and shovels for the quantum computing gold rush will prove to be a winning approach over the long run, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

This is one of the most aggressive rounds of layoffs in the company's history.\n\nThat odd mix of record AI expenditure and big cutbacks is changing how your portfolio is exposed to Big Tech without you even noticing.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI makeover: Record spending, real people out\n\nMicrosoft seems to be unstoppable on the surface.\n\nThe company's Azure cloud business is expanding at a high rate of more than 10%. AI \"copilots\" are built into a variety of things, such as Office and GitHub. The stock is a major part of practically every large-cap index fund.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nInvestors hope good news from Nvidia gives the rally more life Palantir CEO Karp just settled major debate Spotify just solved a major problem for listeners Amazon lawsuit could be a warning to other employers\n\nThe firm is undertaking two things at once behind the scenes:\n\nAI spend surges: Company blog and filings reveal plans to pour $80 billion this fiscal year into AI-ready data centers. Headcount falls: A July memo confirmed over 15,000 layoffs in 2025, including 9,000 in a single month.\n\nSatya Nadella, the CEO, has said that the layoffs are \"weighing heavily\" on him. He has also made it plain that Microsoft is restructuring around AI, which implies that there will be more capital investment and fewer layers of personnel.\n\nThat doesn't make sense from a worker's point of view. Wall Street sees it as the new normal.AI spending reshapes the future of Big Tech operationsShutterstock\n\nThe new Big Tech model is revenue growth not headcount growth\n\nMicrosoft is merely the most obvious illustration of a bigger change.\n\nTech corporations in Silicon Valley are making more money than ever while secretly laying off workers. Over 141,000 IT jobs had been lost in 2025, according to a Washington Post research report that analyzed data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. This is a 17% increase over the same time last year. Over the previous two years, IT jobs have dropped by around 3% a year throughout the country and by over 19% in California.\n\nRelated: Palantir fans: You\u2019re not going to like what just happened\n\nWhy are the cutbacks still happening while AI sales are up through the roof? A few reasons keep popping up:\n\nStory Continues\n\nAI makes each worker more productive, so businesses don't have to recruit back as many people as they used to. The pandemic's \"growth at all costs\" mentality died when borrowing rates went up; boards now want efficiency. Investors like discipline, particularly when a firm can prove that its revenues are going up even when its number of employees is staying the same or going down.\n\nThat\u2019s the world Microsoft, and a lot of other tech giants, are in now. It\u2019s no longer just about beating the top line. It\u2019s about proving it can grow earnings while keeping payroll tight and redirecting cash into AI infrastructure instead.\n\nThe $300 billion AI bill hiding behind the layoffs\n\nThe human part of this is shown in pink slips. On the capex line, you can see the money side.\n\nAnalysts and data-center trackers currently estimate that the four U.S. hyperscalers, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, will spend more than $300 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, primarily for AI-driven data centers and networking, according to CNBC.\n\nRelated: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S26 makes big bet on thin phones, in-house chips\n\nIn a general sense:\n\nMicrosoft plans to spend around $80 billion on AI-focused data centers and cloud infrastructure in fiscal year 2025. Amazon's capital expenditures are estimated to be above $100 billion in 2025. CFO Brian Olsavsky says a significant portion of this money is for AWS and AI. Alphabet boosted its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $91 billion to $93 billion as it pushes to construct AI infrastructure for Search, YouTube, and the cloud.\n\nFor earnings, the trade looks like this:\n\nRight present, layoffs are cutting operational costs since wages and benefits are leaving SG&A and R&D. AI infrastructure shows up as capital expenditures that lose value over time, which means they don't have a big effect on earnings right away. Investors profit if the AI gamble pays off by bringing in more money, greater automation, and higher margins. Shareholders will have to pay for a highly costly weapons race that also costs thousands of people their jobs if it doesn't. Nvidia and other chipmakers are on the opposite side of that deal. Every time Microsoft and other companies fire a team and buy additional GPUs, the \"AI arms dealers\" that sell that technology become a greater part of your portfolio narrative.\n\nFor earnings, the trade looks like this:\n\nAs salary and benefits leave SG&A and R&D, layoffs lower operational costs. AI infrastructure investment depreciates over years, minimizing earnings effect.\n\nIf the AI investment yields more money for AI, leads to greater automation, and results in higher margins, investors benefit. Shareholders will pay for a highly costly weapons race that also costs thousands of people their jobs if it doesn't.\n\nRelated: The $1 billion bet: how Nokia stake fits Nvidia's AI roadmap\n\nNvidia and other chipmakers are on the opposite side of that deal. Every time Microsoft and other companies fire a team and buy additional GPUs, the \"AI arms dealers\" that sell that technology become a greater part of your portfolio narrative.\n\nHow this quiet reset hits your index funds\n\nYou don't have to own Microsoft to be at risk.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the biggest companies in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon are close behind it. You have wagered that their AI-heavy, lean-headcount plan will work if you hold a wide index fund.\n\nRelated: Is Nvidia\u2019s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn\u2019t think so\n\nFor now, Wall Street loves this because:\n\nMore people are working for the company, but revenue is expanding faster than that. In a harder rate environment, cost reduction, simpler org charts, and AI solutions assist protect operational profits. Big AI capital expenditures make it hard for smaller competitors to climb over the moat.\n\nBut it also means your retirement plan is increasingly vulnerable to one fundamental question: Is the AI reward worth the cost in terms of money and people?\n\nFour numbers that tell you if the AI bet is working\n\nYou don't need a spreadsheet full of calculations to see whether Microsoft's AI shift (and the ones that replicate it) is really benefiting you. These four lines from each earnings report reveal much of the story:\n\nRevenue per employee: Rising output with flat or lower headcount signals real AI-driven efficiency. AI capex as % of revenue: A higher ratio shows the company is committing to AI infrastructure. Operating margin trend: Margins must improve despite big AI spending and layoffs. Share count + capital returns: Buybacks and dividends indicate cash flows are strengthening, not just shifting on paper.\n\nYou can get all of this information from Microsoft's filings and investor presentations. The same criteria works for Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Apple.\n\nThe AI bet you already own whether you like it or not\n\nThe new formula from Microsoft is simple: more GPUs and fewer humans.\n\nYou may not have known it, but if you have an S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 fund, you've already voted for that formula. Your money is helping to pay for a $80 billion AI build-out at the same corporation that recently fired more than 15,000 workers.\n\nRelated: Why Nvidia\u2019s 'big sellers' might secretly be its biggest believers\n\nYou don't have to like that trade-off. But you should be able to see it plainly.\n\nFor individual investors in the AI age, the key question isn't simply what Microsoft will make next. When you look at your next quarterly statement and decide whether you still want to own the AI experiment you're in, you have to ask yourself if exchanging bodies for data centers really seems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Nov 23, 2025, where it first appeared in the Economy section.

Tesla\u2019s valuation is astronomically high.These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) form an elite group of companies known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" due to their industry leadership and market influence.\n\nAs many of these companies continue to deliver market-beating returns, the Magnificent Seven now comprise a remarkable 35% of the value of the S&P 500.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nIn a series of articles, I'll be ranking each of these stocks and discussing why some are still chock-full of untapped potential, while others should be avoided by investors.\n\nHere's why Tesla is my least favorite of the bunch to buy in 2026.\n\nImage source: Tesla.\n\nTesla's core business growth is slowing\n\nIf Tesla can effectively monetize some of its larger bets, such as its planned Robotaxi network, its humanoid robots, or its other artificial intelligence (AI) endeavors, it could easily be the single best Magnificent Seven stock to buy and hold for the next five to 10 years.\n\nBut that's a big \"if.\"\n\nThe major difference between Tesla and the other Magnificent Seven companies is that its core business is struggling.\n\nBy comparison, revenue growth remains strong for Apple's iPhone and services categories. Amazon Web Services generates gobs of free cash flow that funds the company's other ambitions. Alphabet and Microsoft each generate sizable earnings from a variety of digital segments, including cloud computing infrastructure, where they're both major players. Meta Platforms has its highly profitable \"family of apps\" segment, which brings in more than enough to support its billions of dollars in losses from Reality Labs, which contains its metaverse-related operations. And Nvidia's compute and networking segment continues to deliver jaw-dropping results, while its smaller segments are also highly profitable.\n\nBy contrast, Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) deliveries were trending downward in the first half of 2025, though it remains the market leader. Its energy storage business is on firmer footing, but it makes up a small part of the top line. In the third quarter, Tesla grew automotive revenue just 6% year over year as deliveries rebounded, up 7%. However, the company's operating margin fell to just 5.8% -- a steep decline from 10.8% a year earlier.\n\nTesla is spending a ton of money on artificial intelligence and robotics, but it has yet to see a payoff from those investments.\n\nThis past summer, Tesla launched its autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and it has since expanded it to a few other markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area. However, it remains to be seen how profitable it will be at scale.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, so far, that service is being provided by standard Model Y EVs that have been outfitted with Tesla's Robotaxi technology, not the much-discussed Cybercab, which is not yet in production. And in most markets, regulators are still requiring human monitors for those autonomous vehicles.\n\nThere are better buys than Tesla for 2026\n\nTesla's Robotaxis feature pioneering-edge AI, which presents distinct challenges compared to embedding AI within smartphones or personal computers, so the company deserves credit for making progress in that field.\n\nHowever, the risks of investing in Tesla simply aren't worth the potential rewards at this time, especially given the fact the stock is trading at 178 times expected 2026 earnings.\n\nSince Tesla's valuation appears to be increasingly disconnected from its core EV business and based more on the potential of new ventures that have yet to prove themselves, investors may want to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the stock at this time. There are many other compelling buys in big tech.\n\nStay tuned to find out how the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks stack up in my rankings for 2026.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) form an elite group of companies known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" due to their industry leadership and market influence.\n\nAs many of these companies continue to deliver market-beating returns, the Magnificent Seven now comprise a remarkable 35% of the value of the S&P 500.\n\nIn a series of articles, I'll be ranking each of these stocks and discussing why some are still chock-full of untapped potential, while others should be avoided by investors.\n\nHere's why Tesla is my least favorite of the bunch to buy in 2026.Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla's core business growth is slowing\n\nIf Tesla can effectively monetize some of its larger bets, such as its planned Robotaxi network, its humanoid robots, or its other artificial intelligence (AI) endeavors, it could easily be the single best Magnificent Seven stock to buy and hold for the next five to 10 years.\n\nBut that's a big \"if.\"\n\nThe major difference between Tesla and the other Magnificent Seven companies is that its core business is struggling.\n\nBy comparison, revenue growth remains strong for Apple's iPhone and services categories. Amazon Web Services generates gobs of free cash flow that funds the company's other ambitions. Alphabet and Microsoft each generate sizable earnings from a variety of digital segments, including cloud computing infrastructure, where they're both major players. Meta Platforms has its highly profitable \"family of apps\" segment, which brings in more than enough to support its billions of dollars in losses from Reality Labs, which contains its metaverse-related operations. And Nvidia's compute and networking segment continues to deliver jaw-dropping results, while its smaller segments are also highly profitable.\n\nBy contrast, Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) deliveries were trending downward in the first half of 2025, though it remains the market leader. Its energy storage business is on firmer footing, but it makes up a small part of the top line. In the third quarter, Tesla grew automotive revenue just 6% year over year as deliveries rebounded, up 7%. However, the company's operating margin fell to just 5.8% -- a steep decline from 10.8% a year earlier.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTesla is spending a ton of money on artificial intelligence and robotics, but it has yet to see a payoff from those investments.\n\nThis past summer, Tesla launched its autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and it has since expanded it to a few other markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area. However, it remains to be seen how profitable it will be at scale.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, so far, that service is being provided by standard Model Y EVs that have been outfitted with Tesla's Robotaxi technology, not the much-discussed Cybercab, which is not yet in production. And in most markets, regulators are still requiring human monitors for those autonomous vehicles.\n\nThere are better buys than Tesla for 2026\n\nTesla's Robotaxis feature pioneering-edge AI, which presents distinct challenges compared to embedding AI within smartphones or personal computers, so the company deserves credit for making progress in that field.\n\nHowever, the risks of investing in Tesla simply aren't worth the potential rewards at this time, especially given the fact the stock is trading at 178 times expected 2026 earnings.\n\nSince Tesla's valuation appears to be increasingly disconnected from its core EV business and based more on the potential of new ventures that have yet to prove themselves, investors may want to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the stock at this time. There are many other compelling buys in big tech.\n\nStay tuned to find out how the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks stack up in my rankings for 2026.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It's hardly a list, as it's composed of just one company, Nvidia.\n\nHowever, several others aren't too far behind. One of them is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google, which has a current market cap of $3.4 trillion. Will it be the next to hit $5 trillion?\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet isn't the corporation closest to the $5 trillion mark. Other than Nvidia, which has already achieved that milestone but is currently worth less than that, Microsoft and Apple are both ahead. The former has a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion, while the latter is valued at $3.9 trillion.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning Amazon, which is currently trailing at $2.4 trillion. However, it may be able to catch up, provided it gains significant market value while its peers decline over the next couple of years.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe Alphabet could perform at least as well as Amazon for the foreseeable future. Both are leaders in the cloud computing market. Amazon has a larger market share, but Alphabet is growing sales in that division more quickly.\n\nThe rest of their businesses put Alphabet squarely in the lead for one reason -- margins.\n\nAMZN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon generates higher sales, but Alphabet has higher profits and higher margins. Meanwhile, Alphabet still reigns supreme in search, despite challenges from artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.\n\nThe company has made changes to address this issue, including an AI overview and an AI mode within its renowned search engine. Furthermore, Alphabet eliminated a major risk this year and avoided the worst outcome -- that of losing its Chrome browser, a crucial part of its advertising empire -- in its antitrust lawsuit. In my view, Alphabet has enough momentum to stay ahead of Amazon in the next couple of years.\n\nWhat about Apple? Despite the iPhone maker's recent better-than-expected financial results, it's still facing significant threats.\n\nThe tariff situation is constantly evolving, and more news on that front could negatively impact Apple's stock price, as it still manufactures most of its products in China, a country President Trump has targeted with tariffs. Alphabet is also already cashing in on its AI strategy, whereas Apple has been lagging behind its similarly sized tech peers.\n\nAlphabet's AI offerings through its cloud division, including its AI overviews and AI mode, as well as algorithms that increase engagement on YouTube -- leading to higher ad revenue -- are all important tailwinds for the company. So Alphabet could perform much better than Apple and beat the iPhone maker to a $5 trillion valuation.\n\nWhat about Microsoft? Both companies are thriving in the cloud and AI spaces. Microsoft arguably has an edge over Alphabet in both. However, Alphabet appears more reasonably valued when considering traditional valuation metrics.\n\nGOOG Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nThat's one reason Alphabet could overtake even Microsoft to become the next $5 trillion company.\n\nThe more important question\n\nOf course, outcomes are always hard to predict. A lot could happen in the next 12 months (or so) that would disrupt Alphabet's path to a $5 trillion market cap, and one of its peers could get there before.\n\nWill Alphabet perform well enough in the next couple of years to be the next company to reach this goal? That's less important than determining whether the stock is worth holding for long-term investors, regardless of what happens in the short term. In that department, Alphabet looks like a great pick. It's a leader in several industries, boasting massive growth prospects in digital advertising, cloud computing, AI, and streaming.\n\nThe tech giant also has a hand in innovative and potentially disruptive new sectors, such as self-driving vehicles. Further, Alphabet benefits from a strong competitive advantage, thanks to its brand name, switching costs in cloud computing, and network effects in internet search.\n\nAfter eliminating a major antitrust threat, the company's prospects look stronger than ever. All things considered, Alphabet appears to be a buy, even if it doesn't become the next $5 trillion company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $562,536!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,096,510!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 981% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 187% for the S&P 500.

From there, I'll take a look at Alphabet's valuation metrics to help determine if now is a good time to follow Buffett's lead.\n\nWhat types of stocks does Warren Buffett like to buy?\n\nIf you want to learn how to invest like Warren Buffett, you're in luck. While the Oracle of Omaha ranks among the world's wealthiest people, Buffett's approach to investing is quite simple.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio does not feature speculative companies involved in volatile industries. Instead, Buffett seeks out durability. Against this backdrop, it's not surprising that companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Chevron are some of Buffett's largest positions.\n\nEach of these is considered a blue chip company that produces steady, predictable cash flow. Moreover, these businesses often reinvest their profits into shareholder rewards programs such as dividends or stock buybacks.\n\nIn essence, Buffett pounces on businesses with best-in-class brand recognition that sell products that people need in their daily lives. Given these dynamics, many of the positions in Berkshire's portfolio could be seen as stocks that long-term investors can own forever.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAlphabet meets Buffett's checklist\n\nAlphabet checks off many of Buffett's boxes. The company owns two of the most recognizable brands on the planet: internet search platform Google and video-sharing website YouTube.\n\nGiven the level of internet surface area that Alphabet covers, it's obvious why advertisers are eager to capitalize on the engagement the company generates. This gives Alphabet enormous leverage in the form of pricing power, which directly translates into a steady, highly profitable operation.\n\nBeyond advertising, Alphabet has also built a thriving cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Underneath this umbrella sits a custom hardware offering, called tensor processing units (TPUs). Layering cloud software with custom silicon gives Alphabet a direct line into the semiconductor industry -- enabling it to take on incumbents like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nLastly, Alphabet also has a large consumer electronics business in Android -- which competes with Apple -- and is also taking on Tesla in the world of autonomous driving through its subsidiary, Waymo.\n\nAlphabet's diverse ecosystem provides the company with an enviable degree of flexibility -- a form of malleability that positions it to pivot and grow during virtually any economic cycle or emerging technology trend. In turn, the company is consistently profitable, which Alphabet uses to reinvest in innovation as well as reward shareholders through a modest dividend program.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA Buffett masterclass: Finding value in a sea of growth\n\nIn my view, it's unlikely that Buffett decided to initiate a position in Alphabet purely based on the AI narrative. Berkshire's portfolio has always featured a limited number of technology businesses.\n\nHowever, among the tech stocks that Buffett has chosen, a common theme arises. In addition to Apple, Berkshire also has positions in Amazon and now Alphabet. Each of these companies has built diversified ecosystems across software, hardware, and consumer services.\n\nGOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28, Alphabet stock is no longer trading at a bargain. While paying a premium is uncharacteristic of Buffett, Alphabet is still the second-cheapest stock among the Magnificent Seven -- suggesting investors may not be fully pricing in the company's next growth phase.\n\nIn my eyes, Buffett is still sticking to his playbook -- identifying relative value in an otherwise frothy market. Furthermore, I think the timing of Berkshire's purchase of Alphabet stock is telling. In other words, if Buffett and his constituents felt that AI was a fad or a bubble, then Berkshire would not have bought Alphabet stock.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, I think Alphabet remains an attractive opportunity given its proven durability and compelling long-term potential -- with or without AI playing a role in the thesis.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

In addition to Apple, Berkshire also has positions in Amazon and now Alphabet. Each of these companies has built diversified ecosystems across software, hardware, and consumer services.GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28, Alphabet stock is no longer trading at a bargain. While paying a premium is uncharacteristic of Buffett, Alphabet is still the second-cheapest stock among the Magnificent Seven -- suggesting investors may not be fully pricing in the company's next growth phase.\n\nIn my eyes, Buffett is still sticking to his playbook -- identifying relative value in an otherwise frothy market. Furthermore, I think the timing of Berkshire's purchase of Alphabet stock is telling. In other words, if Buffett and his constituents felt that AI was a fad or a bubble, then Berkshire would not have bought Alphabet stock.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, I think Alphabet remains an attractive opportunity given its proven durability and compelling long-term potential -- with or without AI playing a role in the thesis.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

The numbers didn't add up, and when he asked for financial documents, the association's CEO refused to provide them.\n\nWhat followed was a year-long battle that ended with criminal charges, alleged extortion attempts, and a cautionary tale about how small membership organizations across America are vulnerable to theft.\n\nOn Nov. 21, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd announced the arrest of 53-year-old Jennifer Garula-Mers, the former CEO of the East Polk County Association of Realtors (EPCAR), on charges of grand theft involving more than $81,000, according to 10News Tampa Bay (1). The case has left the realtor association \"on the ropes\" and \"all but broke,\" Judd said at a press conference, forcing the organization to consider merging with another association just to survive.\n\n\"She needs to sit in jail,\" Judd declared, according to 10News. \"She's a thief.

The theft continued until her termination in August 2024.\n\nGarula-Mers allegedly gave herself unauthorized salary increases totaling $43,105.86, boosting her final annual salary to $99,472, the sheriff's office reported. She issued herself $12,500 in unauthorized bonuses and wrote additional payroll checks to herself totaling $20,348.89, according to FOX 13 Tampa Bay (3).\n\nShe didn't stop there. Garula-Mers altered EPCAR's contribution rate to her individual retirement account, netting an additional $7,938.27, the Polk County Sheriff's Office stated. She submitted improper reimbursements totaling $2,112.97.\n\nThe EPCAR credit card became another tool for personal gain. Detectives discovered $3,267.51 in non-business transactions, including dining, shopping, beauty supplies, household goods, and Amazon purchases, according to 10News.\n\nIn total, investigators documented losses of $81,453.92, the sheriff's office reported.\n\nWebb challenges the board\n\nWebb's concerns about financial irregularities began early in his presidency. When he challenged Garula-Mers at board meetings for documents and financial information, she refused to comply, according to Judd's press conference remarks reported by 10News.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe response from EPCAR's board of directors was perhaps more troubling than the alleged theft itself: they sided with Garula-Mers, dismissing Webb as a troublemaker and suggesting he leave both the presidency and the association entirely, according to the sheriff's report.\n\n\"When the new president comes in and says there's a problem, the executive board of directors ignores him, chastises him, and suggests he not only leave the association but the presidency,\" Judd said, as reported by FOX 13. \"But who was right here?\"\n\nUndeterred, Webb filed a civil lawsuit to stop what he believed was the theft of association funds. That's when things took a darker turn.\n\nAlleged extortion by \u2018Anthony in Chicago\u2019\n\nAfter Webb filed his lawsuit, he and his father\u2014also a realtor\u2014received a threatening phone call from someone identifying himself as \"Anthony from Chicago,\" according to sheriff's office investigators. \"Things are not going to end well if the lawsuit goes on,\" the caller warned, according to 10News.\n\nDetectives traced the phone back to David Stachowiak, 55, according to the sheriff's office. Judd said Stachowiak was a \"co-conspirator\" hired by Garula-Mers, 10News reported.\n\nStachowiak was arrested in October 2024 and faces multiple felony charges, including extortion, tampering with evidence, and use of a two-way communication device in the commission of a crime, according to Lake Wales News (4). He has since bonded out of jail and awaits trial.\n\nGarula-Mers was arrested Nov. 20, 2025, by the Hernando County Sheriff's Office in Spring Hill, Florida, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. She faces a second-degree felony charge and is being held with no bond until her first court appearance.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett used 8 simple money rules to turn $9,800 into a stunning $150B \u2014 start using them today to get rich (and then stay rich)\n\nWhy does this keep happening? The vulnerability of small associations\n\nUnfortunately, the EPCAR case is not uncommon. Small nonprofits, trade associations, and membership organizations across America are vulnerable to fraud and embezzlement, often with devastating consequences. One-sixth of all embezzlement cases in the United States involve nonprofit and religious organizations, ranking just behind the financial sector in vulnerability to internal theft, according to the Washington Post (5). The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners' 2024 Report to the Nations found that nonprofits suffered a median loss of $76,000 per case, up from $60,000 in 2020 (6).\n\nMany small associations rely on one executive to handle payroll, reimbursements, membership dues, and event budgets \u2014 with no separation of duties, that person can operate unchecked for years. Trade associations typically have volunteer boards composed of industry professionals who may lack accounting training. They're focused on their own businesses and trust the professional they've hired to manage the organization.\n\nOn top of all that, professional forensic audits cost money, sometimes more than small organizations can afford. According to Upper Michigan's Source (7), many associations simply can't afford the investigation needed to pursue prosecution, meaning \"in many cases, the criminal will walk free.\"\n\nA pattern continuing across America\n\nRecent cases illustrate the scope of the problem:\n\nIn October 2025, former Minneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce CEO Jonathan Weinhagen was indicted on federal charges of embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars, KARE 11 reported (8). Prosecutors allege Weinhagen created a fictional consulting company under an alias, billing the chamber more than $100,000. Most shocking: prosecutors say Weinhagen stole $30,000 that the chamber had donated to Crime Stoppers as reward money for unsolved shootings of children in north Minneapolis, KARE 11 reported.\n\nIn August 2025, Elizabeth Simpers, the former Wake Forest Chamber of Commerce president, was arrested after allegedly taking more than $69,000 for personal expenses including dental work, jewelry, and massage services, WRAL reported (9). Simpers had faced similar allegations at her previous employer\u2014the YMCA\u2014yet was still hired to lead the chamber, according to WRAL.\n\nHomeowners associations aren\u2019t immune. In April 2024, Sharon Lee Ann Gordon, treasurer of a Utah HOA, was sentenced after embezzling over $232,000 by writing checks to herself and her boyfriend and forging board members' signatures, according to an IRS press release (10).\n\nThe real cost to EPCAR\n\nWhen a small association suffers embezzlement, the financial loss is only the beginning. For realtor associations specifically, embezzlement can force members to pay higher dues to cover losses, lose access to continuing education requirements, face delayed licensing support, or join larger regional associations at greater cost.\n\nThe reputational damage can be equally devastating. For organizations dependent on voluntary contributions or membership dues, loss of confidence can prove fatal. As EPCAR now faces, associations may be forced to merge or dissolve when their financial reserves disappear.\n\nHow to protect your organization\n\nAccording to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, the top three causes of nonprofit fraud are lack of internal controls, lack of oversight of existing controls, and override of controls. But even small organizations with limited budgets can implement critical safeguards:\n\nSeparate financial duties: The person who writes checks should not be the same person who reconciles bank statements. Even in small organizations, splitting these responsibilities between two or three people dramatically reduces risk.\n\nRequire two signatures: Checks or transfers above a certain threshold should require two authorized signatures, according to the National Council of Nonprofits (11). This simple control would have prevented many documented embezzlement cases.\n\n**Conduct regular audits: **Annual independent audits by external accountants can catch irregularities before they become catastrophic. For organizations that can't afford full audits, even periodic surprise reviews of bank statements and vendor payments create accountability.\n\nMonitor credit cards: Requiring receipts for all reimbursements over a nominal amount and having credit card statements reviewed by someone other than the cardholder are basic controls every organization can implement.\n\n**Use technology: **Modern accounting platforms can flag unusual transactions, require approvals, and create audit trails automatically. Automation reduces the likelihood of errors and fraud while making monitoring easier.\n\nWatch for red flags: The ACFE reports that in 85% of fraud cases, at least one warning sign was present. Common red flags include financial officers who resist transparency, unexplained budget shortfalls, officers who never take vacation, missing financial records, and frequent special assessments.\n\nConduct background checks: According to MIP Fund Accounting Services (12), people who commit fraud at one nonprofit often simply move to another organization and repeat their crimes. Proper background checks on all employees handling finances are essential.\n\nWhat to do if you suspect fraud\n\nFor members or board directors who suspect embezzlement, the steps are straightforward: Document everything by gathering bank statements, invoices, and expense reports. Members are typically entitled to these documents under state law, according to the National Council of Nonprofits.\n\nReport your findings to the board in writing, creating a paper trail. Contact a forensic accountant who can conduct a proper investigation\u2014according to Venable LLP's guidance on nonprofit fraud (14), boards satisfy their fiduciary duties by relying on qualified professionals. File a report with local law enforcement. As Polk County demonstrated in the EPCAR case, law enforcement has tools to trace financial crimes that board members don't.\n\nAccording to JS Morlu LLC's HOA fraud analysis (15), embezzlement is often caught after months or years of misconduct. The longer fraud continues, the greater the loss and the harder recovery becomes.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nGarula-Mers' alleged crimes represent more than one person's betrayal of trust. They shined a light on systemic vulnerabilities in how small membership organizations operate across America.\n\nThe EPCAR case should serve as a wake-up call for every small nonprofit, trade association, chamber of commerce, HOA, PTA, and membership organization: the risk is real, the damage can be devastating, and prevention is far cheaper than recovery.\n\nAs Garula-Mers and her alleged co-conspirator await trial, the lesson is clear: trust alone is not a control system. Every small organization needs formal safeguards, transparent oversight, and a culture where questioning authority is not just permitted \u2014 it's expected.\n\n@placement\n\nArticle sources\n\n10News Tampa Bay (WTSP) (1); Polk County Sheriff's Office (2); FOX 13 Tampa Bay (3); Lake Wales News (4); Washington Post (5); ACFE Report to the Nations data (6); Upper Michigan's Source (7) ; KARE 11 (Minneapolis) (8); WRAL (Raleigh) (9); IRS Criminal Investigation (10); National Council of Nonprofits (11); MIP Fund Accounting Services (12); Venable LLP (13); JS Morlu LLC (14)\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

They didn\u2019t.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIndia\u2019s Richest Family Powers\u00a0Push for Green Space in Mumbai Where Train\u00a0Dreams Meet Reality in Texas San Francisco Hotels That Echoed City\u2019s Decline Sell for 75% Off Despite Star Architect\u2019s Alleged Misconduct, New Harlem and Princeton Museums Shine On the French Riviera, Street Reforms\u00a0Come From the Right\n\nSo where does the AI trade stand now? It depends who you ask.\n\nOn one side you have the skeptics. They\u2019re concerned about soaring market valuations as investors chase growth in a small collection of stocks tied to the AI boom. They see the hundreds of billions of dollars these companies are spending to stay in the race as unsustainable, particularly as they start to take on debt in order to keep up. In addition, the circular nature of these financing arrangements creates a potential systemic risk in which one company\u2019s weakness can bring down the entire trade.\n\nThe other side are the optimists, who see the recent pullback in AI-related shares as a healthy correction on the way to further growth. To them, the mega-cap technology firms at the heart of the AI trade \u2014 Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. \u2014 are going to keep spending to develop their offerings, with no signs of slowing anytime soon. Plus, with the industry\u2019s strong demand and a regulatory environment that\u2019s considered accommodating for growth, they view the AI investment cycle as just in the early innings.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a division,\u201d said Dec Mullarkey, managing director at SLC Management. \u201cWe have had such a long bull run and valuations are stretched so the fear of a blow up in AI is high. But then there is another group of investors looking to sources of stimulus to extend the cycle, such as prospects of Fed rate cuts, less regulation, more M&A and increased IPO activity.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty was highlighted by the stock market\u2019s wild swing Thursday in the wake of Nvidia\u2019s earnings report. The chipmaker\u2019s shares initially jumped more than 5%, supporting a host of other AI plays, before reversing direction and closing down 3.2%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes responded in kind, climbing out of the gate and then quickly wiping out those gains to finish well in the red.\n\n\u201cWe saw an initial relief rally on the confirmation that demand is strong, but investors are now asking the next questions, which are, what about the power needs, what about margins, what\u2019s the ROI?\u201d said Natalie Hwang, managing partner of Apeira Capital Advisors. \u201cRelief rallies can\u2019t hold so long as the market has unanswered questions.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors did get some relief on Friday, as the major equities indexes vacillated between gains and losses in the morning before turning decisively positive.\n\nNvidia\u2019s results arrived just as skepticism about AI is starting to spill over into the broader market. Investors are increasingly spooked by the signs of a potential bubble: elevated valuations, circular financing deals, debt issuance, and lofty aspirations that might be difficult to meet, particularly for OpenAI, the privately held ChatGPT owner that is burning through cash.\n\nThe chip giant\u2019s robust earnings weren\u2019t a surprise since the spending plans of its major customers were telegraphed well in advance. Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta and Alphabet \u2014 which taken together represent more than 40% of Nvidia\u2019s sales \u2014 are projected to increase their combined capital expenditures by 34% over the next 12 months to $440 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe quarter itself was, frankly, exceptional,\u201d said Daniel Pilling, portfolio manager at Sands Capital Management, which owns Nvidia shares. \u201cThe forward looking guidance on a revenue basis was 5% ahead of consensus.\u201d\n\nBeyond Nvidia, other semiconductor companies are struggling all of a sudden as Wall Street questions the durability of AI spending. An index of chip-related stocks is down 11% in November and on pace for its worst month since 2022, with companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Arm Holdings sliding more than 20%.\n\nOn the fringes of the business, Sandisk Corp., the maker of memory chips that went public in February, was up almost 700% for the year when it hit a high on Nov. 12, but that figure has been sliced by about a third after a precipitous decline in the past two weeks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the other side of the spending equation \u2014 return on investment \u2014 that investors are really starting to question. When that pile of cash will translate into faster growth and improved profitability for the companies offering AI software and services is now a serious issue. Wall Street needs to have some clarity on ROI for the trade to pick up steam again, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\n\u201cIt may take another quarter or two for us to get evidence of that, and until we do, this is a story that will remain a point of focus for investors,\u201d Luschini said. \u201cSo long as this percolates in the background, it could jeopardize the otherwise sanguine outlook for AI.\u201d\n\nA full reckoning of the ROI question may have been delayed by Nvidia\u2019s report, since it eased immediate concerns about the sustainability of AI investments. While Nvidia is the \u201clynchpin\u201d of the artificial intelligence trade and its results were solid, they didn\u2019t quell doubts about the big spenders, according to Kevin Cook, senior strategist at Zacks Investment Research.\n\nThat\u2019s where the serious cracks are starting to emerge. Meta shares are down 21% since the company reported earnings on Oct. 29, as investors grow concerned about its aggressive capex plans. Microsoft has fallen 13% since its results on the same day for a similar reason. Companies with weaker balance sheets have taken an even bigger hit, with CoreWeave Inc.\u2019s stock plunging 46% this month and Oracle Corp. sinking 24%, on track for its biggest monthly drop since 2001.\n\n\u201cFor all the bubble blowers out there, maybe they were right about stocks like Oracle and CoreWeave getting ahead of their skis because both of those companies need to borrow a lot of money to just play in the game,\u201d Cook said.\n\nAll of which leaves investors divided based on their perspectives - glass half empty or full. The one area of agreement appears to be that the AI ride is going to get even bumpier along the way.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got questions about the macro, divide over where we are in the progress of the AI revolution and cryptocurrencies melting down,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \u201cI think all of that is part and parcel to the volatility we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPermabull Tom Lee Sees Bitcoin as High as $200,000 by January\u2019s End Weed Drinks That Get You Very, Very High Could Be Gone Soon The Dirty Secret of Biodegradable Plastic Cutting Ties With China Is Harder Than Companies Expected The New Requirement for MBAs Seeking Consulting Jobs: AI Proficiency\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-didn-t-save-market-140007853.html", "symbols": ["1NVDA.MI", "700.US", "AMD.US", "AMZN.US", "ARM.US", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "META.US", "MSFT.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US"], "tags": ["AI", "EARNINGS", "EARNINGS REPORT", "ROI", "SEMICONDUCTORS", "VOLATILITY"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.051, "neu": 0.857, "pos": 0.092}}]
