During the episode, a caller asked if it was too late for them to get into the stock, and Cramer replied:\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. You know, we just initiated the position for the trust. Why? Because it sells at 21 times earnings. Got about a 3% yield, that\u2019s about as low as you ever get Procter, which of course is a dividend aristocrat.

Cramer mentioned the company during the November 11 episode and commented:\n\n\u201cSometimes when stocks are doing badly, I get worried, not because I want to get out, but because I wonder if I might be missing a once-in-a-generational bottom.

Let\u2019s break down whether there\u2019s value hiding beneath the surface for thoughtful investors like you. The stock just gained 2.2% in the past week, although it\u2019s still down 0.8% this month and has slipped 9.1% year-to-date, hinting at shifting expectations and perhaps new opportunities or risks. Market chatter has centered on Procter & Gamble\u2019s expansion in emerging markets and its commitment to sustainability. Both of these factors have caught investors\u2019 eyes recently, adding buzz and possibly some uncertainty about what\u2019s next for the company. Right now, Procter & Gamble has a valuation score of 2 out of 6. This means it screens as undervalued on just two checks out of a possible six, so there\u2019s certainly more to uncover. We\u2019ll explore how this score stacks up using classic valuation approaches, and at the end, I\u2019ll show you a smarter way to think about value beyond the usual metrics.\n\nProcter & Gamble scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.\n\nApproach 1: Procter & Gamble Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\n\nA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those amounts back to today's dollars. This method provides insight into what the business may be worth, based on the money it is likely to generate in the coming years.\n\nFor Procter & Gamble, the current Free Cash Flow stands at $15.4 Billion. Analysts forecast steady growth in these cash flows, projecting they will reach about $21.4 Billion in 2035. Notably, analysts have only made explicit forecasts through 2028 (with 2028 FCF projected at $17.0 Billion). Later years are based on cautious, methodical extrapolations. All figures are in US dollars.\n\nBy discounting each year's expected cash flows back to a present value, the DCF model calculates Procter & Gamble\u2019s intrinsic value at about $185.05 per share. This is roughly 18.4% higher than the current trading price. This suggests that the stock is presently undervalued based on these long-term cash flow expectations.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUED\n\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Procter & Gamble is undervalued by 18.4%.

It shows investors how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of the company's earnings, making it a quick way to assess whether a stock is trading at a premium or discount relative to its profits.\n\nA fair PE ratio depends on factors such as expected company growth and the perceived risk of its future. Higher earnings growth and lower risk tend to support a higher PE ratio, while greater uncertainty or slower growth usually warrant a lower ratio.\n\nCurrently, Procter & Gamble trades at a PE ratio of 21.4x. This is above the Household Products industry average of 17.6x, and just slightly above the peer average of 20.5x. Although comparisons like these can be helpful, they do not always provide the full picture because each company has unique growth rates, risks, and profitability profiles.\n\nSimply Wall St\u2019s \u201cFair Ratio\u201d is a proprietary metric that estimates the PE you might expect for Procter & Gamble when considering its earnings growth, industry, profit margins, risks, and market cap. Instead of relying solely on averages, the Fair Ratio evaluates both the company and its environment for a more tailored benchmark.\n\nWith a Fair Ratio of 25.8x compared to the actual 21.4x multiple, Procter & Gamble appears undervalued according to this more comprehensive approach.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUEDNYSE:PG PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\n\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1422 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth.\n\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Procter & Gamble Narrative\n\nEarlier we mentioned that there\u2019s an even better way to understand valuation, so let\u2019s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simplified framework allowing investors to build and share their own story or perspective about a company like Procter & Gamble. This approach connects the company\u2019s business fundamentals to future estimates and ultimately to a fair value. Instead of just crunching numbers, Narratives let you combine your assumptions about revenues, earnings growth, and margins with your take on what really drives the business. This makes the investment process more personal and insightful.\n\nNarratives are available to everyone on Simply Wall St\u2019s Community page and are already used by millions of investors. They streamline the decision process by showing how your unique outlook translates into a financial forecast and a fair value estimate. You can then compare that fair value with the current market price to decide if it\u2019s time to buy or sell. Narratives aren\u2019t static, either. When big news or earnings updates come in, these stories and their valuations automatically adjust, so your perspective stays relevant in real time.\n\nFor example, one investor\u2019s Narrative for Procter & Gamble might forecast slow growth and margin pressure, leading to a low fair value estimate of $105. Another could anticipate robust innovation and buybacks, supporting a high target like $186. Narratives empower you to turn your own informed view into actionable insight.\n\nFor Procter & Gamble, we will make it easy for you with previews of two leading Procter & Gamble Narratives:\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Procter & Gamble Bull Case\n\nFair value estimate: $169.05\n\nCurrently 10.8% undervalued compared to last close ($150.92)\n\nProjected revenue growth: 3.2%\n\nAnalyst consensus expects steady revenue growth, margin improvement, and robust earnings by 2028, supporting a fair valuation above the current market price. Growth drivers include product innovation, cost efficiencies, share repurchases, and expanding presence in various consumer segments. Risks include volatility in core markets, geopolitical tensions, tariffs, and currency fluctuations, all of which could impact revenue and margins if not addressed.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Procter & Gamble Bear Case\n\nFair value estimate: $119.81\n\nCurrently 26% overvalued compared to last close ($150.92)\n\nProjected revenue growth: 4.7%\n\nDespite strong brand strength and operational efficiency, future growth is expected to remain modest and align with inflation, causing limited upside. Valuation methods such as DCF, dividend models, and historical comparisons all point towards a current trading price above estimated fair value, suggesting the stock is richly valued. P&G remains a high-quality, stable dividend payer, but investors may need to be cautious about buying at current prices unless fundamental growth or margin expansion accelerates.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Procter & Gamble?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned -2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry, which P&G falls in, has lost 4.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nP&G is expected to post earnings of $1.88 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.01 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.6%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.41 indicates a change of +5.7% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor P&G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.36 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $86.99 billion and $89.51 billion estimates indicate +3.2% and +2.9% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nP&G reported revenues of $22.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3%. EPS of $1.99 for the same period compares with $1.93 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.15 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.05%. The EPS surprise was +4.74%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, P&G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nP&G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That\u2019s why the brand is proud to introduce this innovative solution that\u2019s accessible to everyone and doesn\u2019t come with a $180 price tag.\n\n\"While some causes of hair loss are out of our control, scalp oxidative stress is one we can effectively address,\" said Jeni Thomas, Ph.D, Global Principal Scientist for Pantene. \"With Abundant & Strong, Pantene brings rigorous clinical research and dermatologist-tested technology to women everywhere who want to increase hair density and grow healthier hair.\"\n\nThe Abundant & Strong Collection includes a shampoo, conditioner, and daily scalp serum that works together by improving root and length retention. This system delivers visible improvements in hair density in as little as six weeks.\n\nThe Science Behind Abundant & Strong\n\nExcess hair loss can occur when scalp skin becomes too loose to securely hold hair at the roots. Recent research, published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science, shows that free radicals from UV exposure and environmental stressors can disrupt the scalp\u2019s structure, weakening its ability to hold hair at the roots and leading to increased shedding - underscoring the importance of maintaining overall scalp health to help curb hair loss.\n\nTo combat this, Pantene scientists discovered a powerful trio of ingredients with synergistic antioxidant activity to reduce scalp oxidative stress:\n\nPro-Vitamin B5 \u2013 A deeply absorbing hair nutrient with antioxidant and protein bonding powers Niacinamide \u2013 Also known as Vitamin B3, an antioxidant known for strengthening skin\u2019s barrier Piroctone Olamine \u2013 An antioxidant that reduces free radicals on the scalp surface\n\nCombined, these ingredients form Pantene\u2019s Pro-Vitamin Complex + Niacinamide, which is at the core of the Abundant & Strong Collection - to help reduce hair loss caused by scalp oxidative stress and restore the foundation for abundant, resilient hair.\n\nStory Continues\n\nClinically Proven Results\n\nAfter 1 use: Hair looks visibly thicker. After 4 weeks: 77%*** saw less hair loss. After 6 weeks: Over 85%** noticed increased hair density. After 8 weeks: 6,000 more strands retained at the root.\n\n\"Pantene has always stood for healthy, beautiful hair,\" said Robert Reiss, VP, Pantene North America. \"Abundant & Strong marks a major milestone for us, a breakthrough system powered by cutting-edge science that delivers real, measurable results. We\u2019re proud to bring dermatologist-backed innovation to consumers in a way that\u2019s both effective and accessible to all.\"\n\nPantene is bringing this innovation to life through high-impact partnerships with Trichologist Abbey Yung and social media personality Alix Earle, along with dynamic campaigns, immersive events, and more.

Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently", "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s a tough time to be looking for a job.\n\nAmid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a \u201cno-hire, no fire\u201d standstill. That's caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizeable layoffs have continued to pile up \u2014 raising worker anxieties across sectors.\n\nSome companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump's barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly \u2014 or, as seen with big names like Amazon, are redirecting money to artificial intelligence.\n\nFederal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many to work without paychecks.\n\nThe impasse, which ended earlier this month, also put key economic data on hold. In a delayed report released Thursday, the Labor Department said that U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. And there\u2019s growing gender and racial disparities. The National Women\u2019s Law Center notes that women only accounted for 21,000 of September\u2019s added jobs \u2014 and that Black women over the age of 20, in particular, saw unemployment climb to 7.5% for the month.\n\nThe shutdown has left holes in more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won\u2019t release a full jobs report for October.\n\nHere are some of the largest job cuts announced recently:\n\nVerizon\n\nIn November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and \u201creorient\u201d the entire company.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nGeneral Motors moved to lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for \u201ctemporary layoffs\" at the start of next year.\n\nParamount\n\nIn long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees \u2014 about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisi\u00f3n Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon said Tuesday that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally.\n\nUPS\n\nUnited Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company's shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year.\n\nTarget\n\nTarget in October moved to eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts.\n\nNestl\u00e9\n\nIn mid-October, Nestl\u00e9 said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally \u2014 as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years.\n\nLufthansa Group\n\nIn September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 \u2014 pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines.\n\nNovo Nordisk\n\nAlso in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company \u2014 which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition.\n\nConocoPhillips\n\nOil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025.\n\nIntel\n\nIntel has moved to shed thousands of jobs \u2014 with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 \u201ccore\u201d workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That\u2019s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nIn May, Microsoft began began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions \u2014 marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited \u201corganizational changes,\u201d but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI.\n\nProcter & Gamble\n\nIn June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company\u2019s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring \u2014 also arriving amid tariff pressures.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/layoffs-piling-raising-worker-anxiety-170721877.html", "symbols": ["1AMZN.MI", "1MSFT.MI", "700.US", "AMZ.DU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.HM", "AMZ.MU", "AMZ1.F", "AMZN.BA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.SN", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "MSF.BE", "MSF.DU", "MSF.F", "MSF.HM", "MSF.MU", "MSF0.F", "MSFT.BA", "MSFT.MX", "MSFT.SN", "MSFT.US", "MSFT34.SA"], "tags": ["AI", "JOB-MARKET", "LAYOFFS", "RESTRUCTURING", "TARIFFS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.939, "neg": 0.048, "neu": 0.93, "pos": 0.022}}, {"date": "2025-11-20T14:19:55+00:00", "title": "The Tech Rotation Is On and Dividend-Paying Blue-Chips Are the Winners", "content": "Riddy / iStock via Getty Images\n\nTechnology investors are rotating into dividend stocks as a response to several growing market pressures. After years of chasing high-growth tech companies in a zero-interest-rate environment, many investors are now seeking more stable, income-generating assets amid economic uncertainty and falling interest rates. The spectacular run-up in tech valuations, particularly in AI-related stocks, has left many investors concerned about stretched valuations and the sustainability of growth narratives, prompting a defensive shift toward companies that can demonstrate profitability and return cash to shareholders. Especially since, according to Bloomberg, the Magnificent 7 are spending less on buybacks and more on capital expenditures.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points\n\nData is increasingly showing that investors are moving from tech giants to dividend-paying blue-chip stocks. Many investors are concerned with the circular financing between the big AI players and the hyperscalers. Quality blue-chip dividend stocks never go out of style and should perform well as interest rates go lower.

But that latter profile has taken a hit in recent weeks, as the likes of Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ: ORCL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN),\u00a0 and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) tap the credit market for billions to fund artificial intelligence projects. The result is the first sustained selloff for the group since April, with the Nasdaq 100 leading the broader market lower as investors ditch tech winners in favor of more defensive stocks. One of the beneficiaries: companies with juicy dividend payments. That group, which includes old-economy stalwarts, is often coveted when riskier stocks start to look expensive. They also tend to be calmer in times of turbulence. The Cboe Volatility Index jumped above 24 on Tuesday (11/18), surpassing its long-term average of 19.\n\nBlue-chip stocks are shares of large, well-established, financially stable companies with a consistent and reliable performance history. They are often considered less risky and are a popular choice for long-term investors. Additionally, nearly all leaders in the category pay dependable, recurring dividends each quarter, regardless of the state of the economy. The term \"blue chip\" originated in poker, where the highest-value chip is blue.

Time to Follow Suit?", "content": "Fundsmith\n\nQuick Read\n\nFundsmith sold its entire Mastercard (MA) position in Q3 and cut Meta Platforms by over half. Fundsmith trimmed positions aggressively in 2025 with minimal buying activity. Berkshire Hathaway built cash to $382B while Fundsmith reduced equity exposure amid high valuations. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nTerry Smith, founder of Fundsmith, has earned the nickname, the \"English Warren Buffett\" for his disciplined, long-term approach to investing in high-quality companies at reasonable prices -- much like the Oracle of Omaha himself.\n\nSince launching the Fundsmith Equity Fund in 2010, Smith has delivered strong returns by focusing on a concentrated portfolio of resilient global growth stocks, avoiding hype-driven sectors, and emphasizing businesses with high returns on capital and predictable cash flows. His straightforward style, annual shareholder letters critiquing market excesses, and personal investment in his own fund mirror Buffett's philosophy at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B). With around $20 billion in assets under management, Fundsmith remains one of the U.K.'s most successful active funds.\n\nNow, Smith appears to be echoing Buffett's recent caution. While the Oracle has built Berkshire Hathaway's cash hoard to a record $382 billion by net selling stocks for multiple quarters, Smith has spent much of 2025 trimming positions aggressively with only minor additions -- suggesting both legends see limited attractive opportunities at current valuations.\n\nA Year of Ruthless Pruning\n\nPortfolio trimming has defined Fundsmith's activity throughout 2025. Smith's strategy of \"buy good companies, don't overpay, and do nothing\" shifts to active reduction when valuations stretch too far. 13F filings and updates show consistent sales across quarters, reducing exposure to expensive names while cash balances implicitly rise.\n\nThe pattern intensified in the third quarter. Reports indicate Smith fully exited at least five positions, including completely selling out of Mastercard (NYSE:MA). He also cut Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) -- once a top holding -- by more than half and slashed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) almost in half. These moves reduced exposure to high-multiple tech leaders that drove much of the market's gains.\n\nOn the buy side, activity stayed minimal. Smith nominally added to Visa (NYSE:V) -- his fifth-largest holding today -- and made small increases in Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). These remain relatively minor positions in the roughly 30-stock portfolio, underscoring that additions were dwarfed by sales.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOverall, the fund's equity exposure contracted, with top holdings becoming even more concentrated in remaining names like Stryker (NASDAQ:SYK) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nEchoes of Omaha\n\nThis mirrors Buffett's playbook. Berkshire has been a persistent net seller, unloading big stakes in companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) while struggling to find full replacements for its capital. Both investors seem to share a view that many quality stocks -- especially in tech and consumer -- trade at premiums that leave little margin of safety. With markets hitting repeated highs amid AI enthusiasm, forward earnings multiples have expanded sharply, making it harder to justify new commitments.\n\nSmith has long warned against overpaying, even for excellent businesses. His recent letters highlight concerns over elevated valuations and concentration risks in indices dominated by a handful of mega-caps. By selling into strength and waiting, he preserves firepower for better entry points, just as Buffett hoards cash rather than chase momentum.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nBuffett and Smith signal growing distrust in today's valuations. While some billionaires place large short bets on leading AI names and others exit entirely, these value purists prefer patience over participation. Their actions suggest the market's enthusiasm may have outrun fundamentals, leaving stocks vulnerable to disappointment.\n\nRetail investors don't need to liquidate everything -- Smith and Buffett remain fully invested in their best ideas -- but protecting downside makes sense. Consider raising cash allocations, hedging concentrated positions, or stress-testing portfolios against higher rates or earnings misses. When two of the world's best wait on the sidelines, it often pays to take notice.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong.

Dividend Kings are excellent choices for investors who prioritize dividend reliability, and these five may appeal to value investors. 10 stocks we like better than PepsiCo \u203a\n\nA 4% dividend yield isn't much when the S&P 500 is on track to gain over 15% for the third consecutive year. But generating a stable and growing stream of passive income can be an excellent way to supplement retirement income or achieve a financial planning goal without relying on rising stock prices.\n\nYet, dividends are only as reliable as the companies paying them. So companies that combine an extensive track record of dividend growth with a high yield are elite choices for income investors.\n\nThere are only 56 or so Dividend Kings -- which are companies that have boosted their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years. Here are five Dividend Kings that are down 5% to 33% year to date to buy in November.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe consumer staples sector is getting crushed\n\nDividend Kings PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG), Colgate-Palmolive(NYSE: CL), Kimberly-Clark(NASDAQ: KMB), and Target (NYSE: TGT) have gradually expanded over the decades, growing their earnings and, in turn, the amount they directly pay shareholders through cash dividends.\n\nHowever, all five of these Dividend Kings are down big in 2025. In fact, consumer staples is the worst-performing sector year to date. Consumers have been hit hard by rising costs of living, inflationary pressures, mounting credit card debt, relatively high interest rates, and now a weakening job market.^IXT data by YCharts\n\nThese factors have reduced foot traffic at Target and impacted demand for Pepsi's snacks (under the Lay's and Quaker Oats brands) and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as household and personal products owned by P&G, Colgate, and Kimberly-Clark.\n\nBut there's good reason to think better times may lay ahead for each of the companies.\n\nNavigating the slowdown\n\nPepsiCo\n\nTo overcome this period of sluggish growth, Pepsi is working on a portfolio transformation and cost reductions to improve its operations, especially in its supply chain, and responding to increased interest in wellness and healthy snacks. Many of Pepsi's recent acquisitions don't overlap with its existing salty snacks and soda brands.\n\nOver the past year, Pepsi acquired full ownership of the companies that make Sabra and Obela products (emphasis on Mediterranean-inspired dips and spreads), Siete Foods (Mexican-American food products such as sauces, seasonings, and snacks), and prebiotic and juice brand Poppi -- which is perhaps the biggest portfolio diversification for Pepsi in years.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThese moves should help Pepsi adapt to changing consumer preferences without damaging its existing brands.\n\nProcter & Gamble\n\nP&G continues to exhibit impeccable pricing power and is forecasting modest earnings growth. The company's international exposure and leading brands across several key categories allow the company to offset weakness in one segment with growth in another.\n\nRight now, its overall skin care business and multiple product categories in Greater China and Latin America are producing solid results, which is helping offset a slowdown in North America.\n\nColgate-Palmolive\n\nUnlike P&G, which is well-diversified across several consumer categories, Colgate is mainly an oral and home care products company. The Colgate brand is a global leader in toothpaste and toothbrushes.\n\nThe brand is immensely valuable, as Colgate is known for its ultra-high operating margin and return on invested capital. Colgate also owns Hill's Pet Nutrition, which is arguably its second-most-valuable brand, behind Colgate. The segment is high-margin and accounted for a whopping 22.6% of Colgate's net sales for the nine months ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn this vein, Colgate is one of the most reliable consumer staples companies because its portfolio is built around a few leading brands.\n\nKimberly-Clark\n\nKimberly-Clark has gotten hammered as of late, with the stock now hovering around a 10-year low.^SPX data by YCharts\n\nInvestors reacted negatively to the company's $48.7 billion deal to acquire Kenvue. The acquisition comes just a little over two years after Kenvue completed its separation from Johnson & Johnson -- forming an independent company focusing on consumer health through leading brands like Band-Aid, Johnson's, Listerine, Neutrogena, Aveeno, and Tylenol.\n\nPart of the negative reaction may be due to claims linking Tylenol usage and autism, as well as cancer claims linked to its baby powder products. Additionally, Kimberly-Clark is a paper products company that produces toilet paper, paper towels, tissues, diapers, adult care, and feminine care products, which is completely different from Kenvue's product portfolio.\n\nWith so much going wrong, it's easy to lose sight of the company's strengths. Kimberly-Clark owns Huggies, which is right up there with P&G-owned Pampers as the leading brands in the diaper category. Its Kleenex brand is the leading facial tissue in the world. Scott is a top paper towel and toilet paper brand, and Cottonelle is a leading toilet paper brand.\n\nKenvue also has many category-leading brands. And a key similarity between Kimberly Clark and Kenvue is that demand for many of their categories tends to hold up well, even during a recession, making Kimberly Clark a highly intriguing value stock for patient investors to consider.\n\nTarget\n\nTarget can't compete on value with Walmart, Costco Wholesale, or Amazon. Or on grocery prices. Its slight premium across product categories is leading to pressure on sales and margins.\n\nHowever, Target is turning its business around by playing to its strengths -- such as improving the in-store experience, exclusive partnerships, and e-commerce. Even with declining growth, Target still generates substantially more free cash flow and earnings than is needed to pay its dividend.\n\nThese Dividend Kings are dirt cheap\n\nThe sell-off across these consumer staples names has pushed their yields up above historic averages and their valuations down -- offering a compelling cost basis for long-term investors.PEP PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Pepsi, P&G, and Colgate, in particular, tend to command premium valuations due to their high-quality portfolios. But all three of those stocks fetch highly attractive valuations based on forward earnings projections.\n\nKimberly-Clark trades at the steepest discount to its historical average, but that valuation should be taken with a grain of salt considering earnings will change dramatically once the acquisition of Kenvue goes through.\n\nFive regal ways to boost your passive income stream\n\nWith valuations of many top stocks elevated, investors may want to consider adding shares of quality companies priced for what they are already earning rather than what they could earn years down the line.\n\nInvestors looking for high-margin cash cows may want to focus mainly on P&G and Colgate-Palmolive. Pepsi and Target are compelling turnaround plays, and Kimberly-Clark is arguably the best deep value stock of the bunch.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

One of the beneficiaries: companies with juicy dividend payments.\n\nThat group, which includes old-economy stalwarts like Exxon Mobil Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., is often coveted when riskier stocks start to look expensive. They also tend to be calmer in times of turbulence. The Cboe Volatility Index jumped above 24 Tuesday, surpassing its long-term average of 19.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common for investors to favor dividend-paying stocks when overall market valuations look stretched. These stocks often trade at lower valuations, and the steady cash flows can help cushion volatility,\u201d said Christopher Cain, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s US quantitative equity strategist.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Magnificent 7 index has lost 7.6% since it peaked on Oct. 29, as investors grow concerned about the AI trade. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF is down just 1.3% in the same time period.\n\nThe divergence is continuing a trend where tech is taking on its more traditional role as a growth sector, while defensive plays such as health-care, utilites and makers of household necessities come into favor.\n\nCorrelation between the Mag 7 and defensive sectors has fallen to 80%, according to 22V Research, underscoring the shift in risk appetite.\n\n\u201cThe underlying theme is a rotation into industries that return a lot of cash,\u201d the firm said. 22V\u2019s long-short Cash Return factor \u2014 which tracks dividends and buybacks \u2014 is up 1.4% in the past week and 2% in the month, while broader indexes are down across the board. The dividend yield factor was the second-best performer on a weekly basis among the 12 tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nAnother allure of dividend payers comes from signs the Federal Reserve isn\u2019t a lock to cut interest rates after its Dec. 10 meeting. Treasury yields are near multi-month lows, making equity payouts attractive.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cIf the Fed is going to not let the economy run hot, then you want to rotate into things that are higher quality, steadily returning cash to investors. And that\u2019s the phenomenon we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d said Kevin Brocks, director at 22V Research.\n\nDuring the market pullback this month, some of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 are those whose dividends are high relative to share prices.\n\nDuPont de Nemours Inc., for instance, offers investors a 4.2% dividend yield and is up 13% this month.\n\nOne challenge for investors seeking safety in dividend payers is that the S&P 500\u2019s overall yield has fallen toward the lowest in 50 years, according to Trivariate Research. The average payout ratio has dropped to 1.14%, the lowest since the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s.\n\nPart of the reason goes back to the big tech firms whose need for cash is slowing dividend and buyback announcements.\n\n\u201cIt just seems the common thread is high cash return profile. The Mag 7 is spending less on buybacks and more on CapEx, which is why it\u2019s no longer that super high cash returning group, at least, for now,\u201d Brocks added.\n\nTraditional defensive groups like health care, consumer staples and utilities that typically offer stable dividends have been outperforming as their businesses are less exposed to swings in the economic cycle.\n\nHealth-care in particular has emerged as a hedge-fund favorite.

It's happening across the brokerage firms right now, and it's happening in size. Advisors are locking in losses to offset the big realized gains from earlier in the year, especially back in April when clients trimmed their winners and booked profits. We know from trading partners across the Street that most of the sell orders for stocks with year-to-date losses are coming in as market orders, which we interpret as tax loss sellers just looking to get out \u2013 if only for 31 days as the IRS dictates. Between now and year-end, these heavy flows are likely to continue. Portfolios are being repositioned, stocks are being rotated out for the 31-day wash-sale rule, and you're getting a lot of tax-selling. Some good companies are getting thrown out just because they're sitting in the red \u2014 not because anything's necessarily broken from a fundamental perspective. To be clear, I'm not a fan of buying losers. A 52-week low is not a buy signal \u2014 most names hit new lows for a reason. But this year might present some opportunities because there's a lot of technical and tax-driven distortion out there. We had a strong start to 2025, a narrow leadership group \u2013 led by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" and now we're seeing potential dumpster-diving opportunities \u2014 temporary dislocations in quality names. Think about what's showing up on the radar right now: the \"Dogs of the Dow\" for 2025 \u2014 your highest-yielding blue chips \u2014 include names like Verizon , Chevron , Amgen , Johnson & Johnson , Coca-Cola and IBM (we own most of these companies). These aren't speculative trades. They're global franchises yielding between 3% and nearly 7%. VZ CVX YTD mountain VZ and CVX year to date And then, if you look beyond the 'Dogs' \u2014 some of tickers on the 52-week-low list you could find decent companies that might be having an off year. You've got Procter & Gamble , which is actually both a Dog of the Dow and a new-low name; Adobe , ADP , Kimberly-Clark , Kraft Heinz , and Charter Communications \u2014 all making fresh lows. Historically, these haven't been super high-risk tickers \u2014 these are established companies. This exercise shouldn't be about trash picking \u2014 it's about sifting through temporary weakness for quality that's been unfairly sold. If you can find a name with a solid balance sheet, strong free cash flow, and a dividend that pays you to wait, it may be worth a look while everyone else is selling it for tax reasons. And that brings me to one of those names I'm actually buying: IBM . IBM YTD bar IBM in 2025 IBM is a current Dog of the Dow yielding just over 2%, and I think it's quietly turning into one of the more interesting opportunities in large-cap tech. The market still treats IBM like an old-school mainframe company, but that's outdated. Nearly half their revenue now comes from software, hybrid cloud, and AI services. In the last quarter, software revenue was up almost 9% and free cash flow came in around $13.5 billion. At roughly 25 times forward earnings, you're getting a high-yielding, cash-rich, AI-levered enterprise name at a discount \u2014 and that's not something you can say about most of mega-cap tech right now. The z17 mainframe refresh is ramping up, Red Hat continues to deliver, and enterprise AI adoption is just starting to flow through. If anything, the year-end weakness we've seen looks like an opportunity. \"Harvesting\" this year doesn't mean chasing broken stories. It means recognizing that forced, tax-driven selling creates inefficiencies \u2014 and if you're disciplined, it can let you sometimes pick up quality companies like IBM at cheaper valuations. For long-term investors, I think this is the kind of setup that can quietly compound while the market's busy watching the shiny objects.

Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson offer stable dividends, strong balance sheets, and catalysts that could provide upside in a downturn. A rotation away from AI and into Dow components could make the DIA ETF a compelling defensive play for 2025. Interested in SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nAt one point in early November, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) briefly topped 48,000 for the first time ever. At different times in 2025, the NASDAQ and S&P 500 have made new all-time highs (ATHs). Despite sharp price swings, it's been a solid year to own stocks.\n\nYet many economists, analysts, and investors remain uneasy. The market appears priced for perfection\u2014but recession risks are not priced in.\n\n\u2192 Why These 3 Tech Stocks Could Be the Best Opportunities You're Overlooking\n\nEven with broad gains, some skepticism persists. The Magnificent 7 trade may have cooled off, but the market is clearly being lifted by a narrow group of names, mostly tied to the AI boom.\n\nThe K-Shaped Economy Concern\n\nCurrent economic commentary focuses on a K-shaped recovery. Higher-income consumers are navigating inflation of around 3%\u2014still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s informal 2% target but manageable for affluent households.\n\n\u2192 3 Energy Giants Amp Up Dividends\u2014Here\u2019s What It Means for Investors\n\nBut lower-income consumers have been under pressure for several years. There\u2019s increasing evidence in credit defaults, delinquent auto loans, and more recently, an uptick in foreclosures, which suggests this problem is getting worse.\u00a0The labor market had been the economy\u2019s strongest pillar, but even that is starting to show signs of strain.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) recently lowered its estimation of the probability of a recession from 60% to 40%, due to the recent de-escalation of trade tensions. But that\u2019s still a significant risk.\n\n\u2192 3 Smart Defensive Stocks for an Uneasy Market\n\nMarket Breadth Remains Narrow as Investors Chase Mega-Caps\n\nRecent data from Charles Schwab shows the percentage of S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Russell 2000 stocks trading above their 200-day moving average was slightly above 50%. That\u2019s historically low market breadth, which is adding to investors' concerns.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a redux of 2021, when investors piled into unprofitable SPACs in hopes of becoming a millionaire. In many cases, the market froth is coming from mega-cap stocks that have plenty of cash on the balance sheet. Still, investors have a sense that many of these stocks are simply overvalued.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo what\u2019s an investor to do? Here are three stocks that provide the opportunity for an asymmetric return in the current uneasy market.\n\nProcter & Gamble Has More Than a Dividend to Like\n\nProcter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) is part of the exclusive Dividend Kings club, meaning the company has increased its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years\u201470 years in the case of PG, which is why it\u2019s a staple in the portfolio of many income-oriented investors.\n\nThe 2.8% dividend yield could look even better if rates fall. Plus, 2025 brings potential growth\u2014the $171.53 price target implies 17% upside.\n\nIt's unclear how the company\u2019s proposed acquisition of Kenvue (NYSE: KVUE) would impact the company\u2019s earnings.\n\nHowever, if the deal goes through and the Tylenol controversy abates, there would almost certainly be a small earnings per share (EPS) dilution in the first year.\n\nAfter that, the dilution would likely turn into a boost in EPS due to cost synergies with the two companies.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Doubles Down on Medtech and Oncology Growth\n\nThe next company on this list is\u00a0Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), the company that spun off Kenvue in 2023 with the intent to lean into its medtech and pharmaceutical businesses.\n\nIts recent $3.5 billion acquisition of Haida Therapeutics is one example of the new company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe all-cash deal gives JNJ access to the clinical-stage company\u2019s HLD-0915 drug candidate.\n\nThis is a once-daily oral prostate cancer medication that received fast-track designation from the U.S Food & Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThis will be a material addition to the company's oncology pipeline, which should make JNJ stock more appealing to growth-oriented investors.\n\nThe DIA ETF Could Benefit From a Flight to Safety\n\nOver the past five years, many investors embraced a passive \"SPY and chill\" strategy, meaning investing in the\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY).\n\nThe SPY may still be a good investment, but with potential AI overexuberance, it may also be time to consider the\u00a0SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: DIA).\n\nIf concerns over an AI bubble take hold, there is likely to be a strong rotation into stocks that make up the Dow 30. That would make the DIA ETF a solid asymmetric investment to capture this rotation play.\n\nAs of this writing, the DIA ETF has only about 37% institutional ownership. However, it\u2019s seen more buying than selling in seven of the last eight quarters, hinting that institutions are beginning to build a hedge against a possible slowdown in the tech trade.\n\nThe article \"3 Smart Defensive Stocks for an Uneasy Market\" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-smart-defensive-stocks-uneasy-150700656.html", "symbols": ["DIA.US", "JNJ.US", "JPM.US", "KVUE.US", "PG.US", "SPY.US"], "tags": ["BALANCE SHEET", "DIVIDENDS", "EARNINGS PER SHARE", "INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP", "MEDTECH", "ONCOLOGY", "PRICE TARGET", "RECESSION", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.059, "neu": 0.82, "pos": 0.121}}, {"date": "2025-11-18T04:39:38+00:00", "title": "3 Safe-and-Steady Stocks to Consider Right Now", "content": "Stocks with low volatility can be a great foundation for a portfolio, especially for investors looking to reduce risk.

Pampers is introducing the world\u2019s tiniest diaper, Swaddlers size \"Preemie extra extra small\" (Pxxs). Designed for the extremely premature skin of babies born as early as 21-22 weeks or weighing less than 500g, this handcrafted diaper is made with premium soft materials. Swaddlers size Pxxs helps NICU professionals provide unparalleled care and comfort to the most vulnerable newborns, living up to Pampers\u2019 promise to be \"Behind Every Baby\", even the tiniest fighters.\n\nPampers collaborated with top medical NICU professionals to design Swaddlers size Pxxs, combining diverse expertise and proven technology to address an unmet need. \"Working in the NICU for over 25 years, I have experience with the challenges involved in caring for premature infants. The Swaddlers Pxxs diapers are a vital innovation, offering a fit and softness in such a small size that we haven't seen before. They truly meet the specific needs of our tiny patients, giving us peace of mind that we are offering the highest level of care,\" Johni Cochran, MSN, NNP-BC at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\"Swaddlers size Pxxs marks a significant advancement in neonatal care.

For today\u2019s micro preemies, there was no diaper that fit their size and met their needs.

That\u2019s why every Pampers product, from diapers to wipes, is crafted with intentional care.

Swaddlers size 'Preemie extra extra small' or Pxxs, is the fourth and smallest diaper in Pampers\u2019 Preemie Collection, and is designed for babies weighing less than 500g.\n\nWhat are the considerations in diapering a preemie? Why is it so important in relation to preemie care?\n\nPreemie babies are extremely vulnerable. Their skin is delicate, and their nervous systems can be easily overstimulated. Thus, diaper changes must be executed with the utmost care to prevent skin irritation or unnecessary stress.\n\nHow prevalent are pre-term births in the United States?\n\nIn 2025, the national preterm birth rate was 10.4%, representing over 360,000 babies and their families ii.\n\nWhen and where will it be available?\n\nPampers Swaddlers size Pxxs will be available at a select group of hospitals in 2025 and will continue to roll out nationwide. The Pxxs will not be sold in retail stores or online as they are handcrafted and uniquely designed to meet the needs of premature babies in the NICU.\n\nWhat does Pampers\u2019 Behind Every Baby commitment mean for preemies?\n\n\"Behind Every Baby\" is a celebration of Pampers\u2019 unwavering commitment to be there for every baby \u2013 from their very first diaper to their first full night of sleep, first steps, and beyond. Swaddlers size Pxxs is the proof point that Pampers is truly behind every baby, even the tiniest fighters. That\u2019s why we created the world\u2019s tiniest diaper.
