Valuation is of the utmost importance to Berkshire's billionaire boss, which makes buying stocks challenging amid a historically pricey market. The apple of Buffett's eye has successfully built trust with its customers and has done a phenomenal job of meeting or exceeding its strategic initiatives. 10 stocks we like better than Domino's Pizza \u203a\n\nIn a little over five weeks, one of the most illustrious investing careers on Wall Street will officially sunset. Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) billionaire boss, Warren Buffett, will be retiring from his role as CEO when 2025 ends and, in the process, hand over the reins of the company's $300 billion investment portfolio to incoming chief Greg Abel.\n\nThere's little doubt that shareholders will be sad to see the Oracle of Omaha hang up his work coat. Since becoming CEO roughly 60 years ago, he's overseen a cumulative gain in Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares (BRK.A) of better than 6,086,000%, as of the closing bell on Nov. 20.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nSome of these gains are the result of smart acquisitions. Berkshire Hathaway comprises around five dozen companies that have been acquired during Buffett's tenure.\n\nBut most investors tend to focus on Warren Buffett's investment activity. His ability to spot amazing deals hiding in plain sight is virtually unmatched on Wall Street.\n\nWhile Berkshire's billionaire chief has seen his trading activity come into question over the last three years amid a historically pricey market, there is one stock the Oracle of Omaha has purchased for five consecutive quarters.\n\nBerkshire's billionaire boss has been picky amid a historically pricey stock market\n\nMost investors are probably familiar with some of Warren Buffett's investing ideals. For example, he prefers to invest for the long term, seeks out companies with sustainable moats and strong management teams, and would never bet against the U.S. economy or the stock market.\n\nHowever, the most important investment characteristic for Berkshire's soon-to-be-retiring boss is valuation.\n\nWarren Buffett Indicator hits a new all-time high of 223%, the most expensive stock market valuation in history \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 pic.twitter.com/p14CI3VXGu -- Barchart (@Barchart) October 26, 2025\n\nIn late October, the Buffett indicator hit an all-time high. This valuation tool, named after Buffett, adds up the value of all publicly traded companies and divides it by U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Dating back to 1970, this measure has averaged 85% (i.e., the value of all public companies has equaled roughly 85% of U.S. GDP). In late October, it topped 225%, signaling the relative priciness of equities to other periods throughout history.\n\nAlthough Buffett is an unwavering long-term investor, his short-term actions and long-term vision aren't always in alignment.\n\nAccording to Berkshire Hathaway's consolidated cash flow statements over the last three years (Oct. 1, 2022 \u2013 Sept. 30, 2025), Buffett has been a net seller of stocks in all 12 quarters. Collectively, he's sold $184 billion more in stock than he's purchased, which has sent his company's cash pile, including U.S. Treasuries, to an all-time high of approximately $382 billion.\n\nIn other words, he's been a very selective buyer -- with one exception.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has purchased this brand-name stock for five straight quarters\n\nIn the past, this \"exception\" would have been shares of his own company, Berkshire Hathaway. After Berkshire's board altered the rules governing share repurchases in July 2018, Buffett spent close to $78 billion, in aggregate, buying back shares of his company's stock for 24 consecutive quarters.\n\nHowever, quarterly filings show that Buffett has gone cold turkey on buying back his company's stock for 16 months (June 2024 \u2013 Sept 2025).\n\nThe only stock the Oracle of Omaha has purchased in each of the last five quarters is fast-food restaurant chainDomino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ):\n\nQ3 2024: 1,277,256 shares purchasedQ4 2024: 1,104,744 shares purchasedQ1 2025: 238,613 shares purchasedQ2 2025: 13,255 shares purchasedQ3 2025: 348,077 shares purchased (2,981,945 total shares held)\n\nDomino's has done pretty well for its shareholders since becoming a public company in July 2004. Including dividends, shares of the company have rallied an astounding 6,400%!\n\nBut Domino's stock didn't really begin to take off until the early 2010s. The start of this notable outperformance coincides with the company's management team recognizing that its product was subpar and making the risky decision to come clean in a national marketing campaign. Although mea culpa advertising campaigns aren't always successful, Domino's bid to be transparent and lay its cards on the table for consumers worked wonders.\n\nWarren Buffett understands fully that companies encounter rough patches from time to time. What he's likely come to appreciate from Domino's Pizza is the trust the company has built with its customers. Trust isn't built overnight, but can be lost with ease.\n\nAnother reason Domino's has thrived is because of its ability to meet or exceed its five-year growth plans. The newest plan, dubbed \"Hungry for MORE,\" focuses on product innovation, leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance productivity and improve its supply chain, and aims to strengthen its brand through its team members and franchisees. The company's stock performance reflects Domino's success in growing its brand.\n\nYet the biggest lure for Berkshire's billionaire boss might just be the capital-return program at Domino's Pizza. In addition to buying back its stock on a fairly regular basis, the company has increased its base annual dividend for 13 consecutive years. Companies that reward their long-term investors with buybacks and dividends tend to be financially stable.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Nov. 20, shares of Domino's Pizza were valued at 20 times forward-year earnings. This represents a 25% discount to the company's average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over the trailing-five-year period. Valuation looks to be the cherry on top, so to speak, which explains why Warren Buffett has been a buyer for five straight quarters.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

Its Berkshire Hathaway stake was trimmed heavily.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway \u203a\n\nBillionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have been close friends for decades. Unsurprisingly, the Gates Foundation Trust owns more than 21 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) -- a stake worth around $11 billion. The Gates Foundation Trust sold many stocks last quarter, including part of its Berkshire Hathaway stake.\n\nWhy did Gates sell 2.4 million more shares of Berkshire last quarter? There are two obvious reasons.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\n1. Berkshire Hathaway is holding a lot of cash\n\nIt's no secret that the stock market in general is getting pretty expensive. The S&P 500 currently trades at roughly 30 times earnings, nearly twice its long-term historical valuation. With that in mind, it would make sense that skilled investors are having a tough time finding market values. Just take a look at Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett has long warned against market timing, yet Berkshire now has more than $380 billion in cash -- more than one-third of its entire market cap!\n\nThis oddly makes Berkshire a wonderful investment for those who are worried about the market. It's like buying a mutual fund that has 30% of its investments in cash. If the stock market declines by 10%, you could expect this fund to fall by only 7% if all else were equal. But Berkshire holds a bigger advantage than simply buffering the effect of a market decline. If markets were to experience a correction, Berkshire now has a ton of cash it can deploy at lower valuations. Few investors have this advantage: the ability to put a ton of cash to work while markets are crashing.\n\nIn essence, Berkshire is a fantastic choice for nervous investors. By buying shares, you keep your money invested, but have the ability to both shoulder marketwide declines and take advantage of potentially lower valuations if a correction does occur. The portfolio managers at the Gates Foundation Trust are likely aware of these advantages, which may explain why Berkshire is the trust's biggest position. But like Buffett, these portfolio managers may be getting nervous about the market's high valuation. Of the trust's 25 holdings, 12 experienced net selling last quarter. A total of zero positions were increased. So while Berkshire may be a relatively safe stock during market downturns, it appears as if the Gates Foundation Trust is so nervous that even Berkshire isn't a candidate for buying at current levels.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\n2. Selling Berkshire stock balances the Gates Foundation Trust's other bets\n\nSelling Berkshire stock has one other benefit for the Gates Foundation Trust's portfolio: more balanced diversification.\n\nEven after the selling, Berkshire remains the trust's largest position, with a 25% portfolio weight. That's right: Roughly one-quarter of the trust's entire portfolio is invested in one stock. Granted, Berkshire itself is fairly diversified, with interests across dozens of industries and geographies. But it's still a single business, leaving the trust's portfolio relatively undiversified versus broader market indexes.\n\nThe latest sales brought down Berkshire's portfolio weighting from 30% to 25%. The selling also occurred near Berkshire's all-time highs -- both in terms of trading price and relative valuation. Last quarter, for instance, Berkshire stock had a price-to-book ratio of around 1.6. Over the past decade, however, shares have usually traded between 1.2 and 1.5 times books value. So while the net selling of Berkshire stock by the Gates Foundation Trust may relate to market valuations and diversification needs, it may also be an indication that it simply thinks that Berkshire stock is overvalued. The fact that Buffett himself declined to execute any share repurchases last quarter backs up this belief.\n\nBoth Gates and Buffett have preached long holding periods. Buffett is clearly nervous about today's market valuations, leaving him so unable to find deals that he needs to sell down top positions simply to hold cash. The selling by the Gates Foundation Trust seems to mirror this nervousness. But remember that this isn't Gates' personal portfolio -- it is the portfolio of a charitable trust whose primary mission is to distribute profits to other causes. Selling, therefore, could simply be the trust delivering on its mission statement, and not a signal of its skittishness over current market valuations.\n\nStill, the foundation has been a net buyer of stock is previous quarters. So while the selling isn't a smoking gun, it's another potentially bearish sign for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

But when I think about which Buffett stock I most want to ride with for the next decade, I keep coming back to a more old-fashioned name.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP) is Berkshire's second largest equity holding and one of its longest-tenured relationships. For me, it captures the heart of Buffett's approach: a durable franchise, advantaged economics, and a business capable of sending real cash back to owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBig conviction in a great business\n\nAs of the end of Q3, Berkshire owned 151.6 million American Express shares, valued at about $50 billion. That stake accounts for close to a fifth of Berkshire's equity portfolio, firmly entrenching American Express as Buffett's No. 2 holding behind Apple.\n\nUnlike the Apple position, which Berkshire has been trimming, the American Express stake has remained unchanged for decades.\n\nThat kind of stability reflects the underlying business. American Express is a global payments company that issues cards, runs its own network, and works directly with merchants. Sitting on both sides of the transaction, it captures rich data on where and how card members spend, which helps the company target high-spending customers and refine rewards in ways rivals struggle to match.\n\nThe company's last full calendar year demonstrates how powerful that model can be.\n\nIn 2024, American Express's revenue rose 9% year over year to $65.9 billion, and earnings per share climbed 25% to $14.01. Additionally, management reported record card member spending, record fee revenue (the revenue the company collects from membership fees from its customers), and record new card acquisitions.\n\nDuring the same year, it returned $7.9 billion to shareholders through $5.9 billion of share repurchases and $2.0 billion of dividends.\n\nContinued momentum\n\nRecent quarters show that momentum has not faded. Second-quarter revenue grew 9% year over year, while earnings per share increased 17%. And third-quarter revenue growth accelerated to a rate of 11%. Earnings per share for the quarter also accelerated, rising 19% year over year.\n\nBenefitting the quarter was a refresh to its consumer and business Platinum cards in the U.S.\n\n\"The initial customer demand and engagement exceeded our expectations, with new U.S. Platinum account acquisitions doubling compared to pre-refresh levels,\" said American Express CEO Stephen Squeri in the company's third-quarter earnings release.\n\nThe successful refresh of the platinum card speaks to the company's pricing power, as it commands an annual fee of $895 -- a fee members eagerly pay to get access to airport lounges and a long list of other perks, including credits for travel, clothes, dining, and more.\n\nAnd valuation is where American Express really stands out among Buffett's big bets. The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24. While financial stocks often sport lower price-to-earnings multiples than stocks in other sectors, it's still notably below both Apple and Alphabet's price-to-earnings ratios of 36 and 30, respectively.\n\nSure, American Express is not cheap compared with many traditional financial stocks, but that multiple looks more reasonable given its consistent double-digit revenue growth, strong credit performance, and shareholder-friendly capital returns.\n\nThe risks, of course, are significant. A meaningful recession could slow card member spending and push credit losses higher, which would crimp earnings and reduce the company's ability to keep growing capital returns at the same pace. Further, competition from banks, buy-now-pay-later providers, and the big card networks remains intense.\n\nOverall, I believe the stock looks attractive despite these risks. Sure, shares could get hit pretty hard in a weak economy. So, anyone who buys the stock today should prepare for volatility and should maintain a long-term view. But I truly believe that, 10 years from now, hindsight will show this as one of Berkshire's best-performing stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in American Express, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and American Express wasn\u2019t one of them.

Taxes and inflation are important considerations.The $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook \u203a\n\nProbably one of the biggest myths about investing is that you need a lot of money to make money. Sure, having a hefty amount upfront would be nice. However, it isn't absolutely necessary.\n\nThere are two key prerequisites to building a fortune without having a ton of money. First, you need time. Second, you must be disciplined.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nCan you even retire a millionaire by investing just $10 per day? The answer is \"yes.\"\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHere's the math\n\nIf you invest $10 per day every day of the year, the total would be $3,650 (with a little more in leap years). However, let's assume you take weekends off and only invest on weekdays. Let's also factor in 10 holidays during the year. That gives us 250 days of investing $10 per day for a total of $2,500 per year.\n\nNow the important question: How should you invest the money? Warren Buffett stipulated in his will that 90% of the cash his family inherits should be invested in low-cost S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index funds. He specifically suggested Vanguard's.\n\nLet's suppose you follow Buffett's approach and regularly buy shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) attempts to track the performance of the S&P 500. Over the long run, the S&P 500 has delivered an average total annual return (including reinvested dividends) of around 10%.\n\nHow long would it take to build a nest egg of $1 million? If we plug $2,500 per year and a rate of return of 10% into a financial calculator, it will tell us that roughly 38 years of investing would be required. A person who plans to retire at his or her Social Security full retirement age of 67 would need to begin investing $10 per day at age 29.\n\nA few caveats\n\nIs it really that simple to become a millionaire? Yes and no.\n\nOur calculation didn't factor in the impact of taxes. You could avoid the tax issue, though, by making contributions to a tax-advantaged retirement account such as an IRA or 401(k) plan.\n\nYou might wonder if investing $10 per day in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is even possible. After all, the ETF currently trades at more than $580 per share. You could simply save up enough money to buy one share. Alternatively, many online brokerages allow buying fractional shares of stocks and ETFs.\n\nImportantly, we're assuming that you resist the temptation to try to time the market. Investing regularly is a critical key to success. You also can't withdraw money along the way, even if your retirement account makes it relatively easy for you to do so.\n\nFinally, there's one issue that's more difficult to work around: inflation. Unfortunately, the corrosive effects of inflation mean that $1 million 38 years from now won't be worth the same as $1 million today. The S&P 500's inflation-adjusted total return over the long term has been around 6.9%. Investing $10 per day for 250 days each year with that return would take roughly 50 years to grow to $1 million in inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nWhat if you don't have 38 years before you retire?\n\nSome readers won't have 38 years until they retire. How can you become a millionaire retiree if you're in the group? You can invest more than $10 per day, try to get a higher return than the S&P 500 has historically generated, or both.\n\nIf you have 20 years until you retire, you'll need to invest around $16,000 each year ($64 per day) to build $1 million, assuming a 10% return. If you only have 10 years, that amount will need to increase significantly to almost $57,500 ($230 per day). This underscores the importance of having time on your side.\n\nHowever, obtaining a higher rate of return can work wonders. The Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF(NASDAQ: VONG) has delivered an average annual return of 16.79% since its inception in 2010. If the ETF delivered this same average return going forward (a big if, by the way), you could still invest $10 per day and be a millionaire in less than 27 years.\n\nThe $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

And though investors have worried about slower-than-expected interest rate cuts or the possibility of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble on the horizon, we haven't seen signs of a market crash ahead.\n\nBut, regardless of the current environment, it's always important to prepare your portfolio for a future crash. That's because the market passes through bull and bear cycles, and over time, crashes do occur. I have two pieces of good news for you, though: The S&P 500 always has recovered and gone on to thrive after a crash, and there are ways to reinforce your portfolio to limit potential damage during tough moments.\n\nOne way to prepare for such an event is through buying shares of quality companies with established businesses and solid long-term prospects. In the event of a crash, these players may suffer somewhat, but they have what it takes to manage the difficult times and quickly rebound as the environment improves.\n\nBuffett's latest move\n\nBuffett, during the third quarter of this year, added one such player to Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. I'm talking about Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), owner of the world's top search engine, Google Search, and cloud computing business, Google Cloud.\n\nAlphabet has delivered many years of earnings growth to investors and established itself as a leader in these two business areas.\n\nBuffett is known for appreciating companies with solid moats, or competitive advantages, and he's surely recognized Alphabet's. This is in the form of leadership in the search business. Google Search has steadily held about 90% market share worldwide and even entered our vocabulary as we often say we're going to \"Google\" something.\n\nImportantly, advertising across the Google platform drives Alphabet's revenue, and here's some more good news: Alphabet's push into AI is improving Google Search and the advertising experience, and this should keep advertisers spending here.\n\nThe promise of growth\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet also offers investors the promise of growth through its cloud business. Google Cloud is benefiting from the AI boom as it offers customers access to top AI products and services. In the recent quarter, the cloud business saw revenue jump 34% to more than $15 billion. And since demand is high for AI capacity, something that Google Cloud provides, we could see this growth continue throughout the phases of the AI boom.\n\nBuffett's purchase of Alphabet surprised investors since he isn't one to invest in many tech companies. But this player offers key elements the billionaire likes, such as the moat I mentioned above and well-run businesses that have proven themselves. On top of this, Alphabet might have won over Buffett for its value \u2013 the company's valuation is very reasonable, and some might even call it cheap.\n\nDuring the quarter of Buffett's purchase, it traded from about 17x forward earnings estimates to about 23x estimates. Valuation has since climbed to 27x estimates, but even at this level, the stock remains reasonably priced.\n\nAll of this means Buffett's best move -- getting in on Alphabet recently -- is one to follow. This top stock is a secure player to own during tough times, such as during a crash, and during better times, it may help power your portfolio higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Streaming services and access provided by smartphones and the connected car remain the platform's largest threat. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than a third of Sirius XM's outstanding shares.10 stocks we like better than Sirius XM \u203a\n\nIf you own or lease a car, there's a good chance that you know about Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI). After the 2009 merger of Sirius and XM, it became the country's lone player in satellite radio. Drivers pay between $10 and $25 a month for access to dozens of premium music, sports, news, and talk channels through car dashboards in vehicles with factory-installed satellite receivers. There's also a digital streaming component for access outside of the car or for drivers without factory-installed Sirius or XM receivers.\n\nHow well do you know the business, its competitors, and its largest shareholder? These are things you should probably have a good read on before becoming the next Sirius XM stock investor. Let's turn up the volume so you can decide whether the satellite radio provider is the right stock for you.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHow does Sirius XM stock make money?\n\nAs a paid subscription service, it's not surprising that Sirius XM makes the lion's share of its money from the monthly premiums it collects from its listeners. Subscription revenue accounts for $6.6 billion -- or 76% -- of the $8.7 billion it reported as revenue for all of last year.\n\nUnlike traditional terrestrial radio that continues to crank out through the AM and FM bands on car radios, advertising is a small part of the business model for Sirius XM. Ad revenue for Sirius XM, as well as the Pandora streaming service it owns, clocked in just shy of $1.8 billion last year, 20% of the top-line mix. The remaining 4% of the business comes from the equipment, accessories, and other revenue.\n\nWho are Sirius XM's biggest competitors?\n\nTwo decades ago -- around the time that Howard Stern signed the first of his four five-year deals that catapulted satellite radio to the mainstream -- Sirius XM's biggest rivals for driver eardrums were terrestrial radio and a car's CD or tape deck. The smartphone and connected car have made streaming service stocks, led by Spotify, the biggest competitors for satellite radio.\n\nSirius XM still served 32.8 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter of 2025. Revenue is declining slightly for the third consecutive year, but its monthly churn rate of 1.6% is within its historical range. The subscriber count peaked seven years ago at 34.9 million. Streaming options are gradually gaining market share, but it's been a slow fade out for Sirius XM.\n\nTell me more about Sirius XM's largest shareholder\n\nYou can buy shares of Sirius XM, but you won't out-own Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Buffett's firm has been adding to its stake since the summer of 2024 and now owns a 37% chunk of the media stock.\n\nIt's easy to see the appeal of Sirius XM to its largest stockholder. Sirius XM may be struggling as a growth stock, but it's holding up nicely for value investors. It continues to generate annual free cash flow north of $1 billion, and it's trading for less than 7 times forward earnings, with a healthy current yield of 5.3%. There may be long-term viability concerns for the platform, and the debt is substantial, but it's still comforting to have Berkshire Hathaway in its corner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sirius XM wasn\u2019t one of them.

Goldman Sachs isn\u2019t the only outfit to suggest that renewables are nowhere near ready to displace oil and gas. Berkshire Hathaway is an easy, palatable way to maintain some healthy exposure to the energy sector.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway \u203a\n\nThe proliferation of renewable energy sources like solar and wind isn't happening quite as quickly as initially expected, postponing the point in time where the world's consumption of crude oil and natural gas stops finally stops growing and starts shrinking.\n\nThat's the overall take from investment bank Goldman Sachs' analysts, anyway. In a recent research report, they suggested that the planet's daily consumption of oil will likely grow from last year's average of 103.5 million barrels per day to 113 million in 2040, driven by a combination of growing demand for jet fuel, AI data centers' soaring need for power, and slower-than-anticipated uptake of electric vehicles. This outlook adds five years to Goldman Sachs' previous belief that the world would reach \"peak oil\" in 2035.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nThis shift has implications for all stocks within the energy sector, and plenty of stocks outside of it. It's Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), however, that's arguably positioned to experience the most unexpected benefit of crude oil's now-lengthened lifespan.\n\nToo much agreement to simply dismiss\n\nWere it just Goldman Sachs, the report might be dismissible. Even the investment bank itself acknowledges that its view is markedly \"above consensus.\"\n\nIt's not just Goldman Sachs, though. The International Energy Agency also recently moved its expectation for the planet's peak-oil pivot all the way up to 2050. This aligns with oil giant ExxonMobil's outlook citing the 25% increase in electricity production the world will likely need between now and then. Indeed, even in the most optimistic of scenarios, ExxonMobil says oil and natural gas are still likely to be the planet's single biggest sources of power 25 years from now. And we'll still need lots of crude past that point as the world continues to wean itself from fossil fuels.\n\nPro-oil OPEC, of course, has never not been bullish on crude for the long haul. In July, it reiterated that it believes demand for oil will grow indefinitely into the distant future.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis all obviously bodes well for energy stocks. Investing in oil and gas names, however, can be a bit more \"adventurous\" than most investors may be willing to accept. These stocks tend to ebb and flow on a daily basis with crude prices themselves, yet are also affected by an ever-changing supply and demand dynamic regardless of the commodity's price. It might make sense to curb some of these names' inherently unpredictable volatility.\n\nIt's Berkshire Hathaway, of all things, that just might do the trick.\n\nThe Berkshire you know, and the one you don't\n\nBerkshire remains a most curious enigma. It's one part mutual fund and one part private-equity fund, supporting -- yet also somehow supported by -- an insurance operation with a reliable and largely unrestricted cash flow.\n\nIt's also a surprisingly effective way of tapping into oil's bright future without the usual stress of owning direct exposure to the sector.\n\nThe most obvious way it does so is with its stakes in individual oil and gas stocks Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) and Chevron(NYSE: CVX). As of the latest look, Berkshire owns 265 million shares of the former (more than $11 billion worth), and 122 million shares of the latter (worth nearly $19 billion). Combined, they account for roughly 10% of the conglomerate's entire portfolio of publicly traded stocks.\n\nThen there are the related holdings that you may not realize are part of the Berkshire family because they're small subsidiaries of wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway Energy. These include natural gas pipeline outfits Kern River, Northern Natural Gas, and BHE GT&S. There's also pipeline-optimization outfit LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. (or LSPI), motor oil and automotive additive brand Lubrizol, and Pilot Travel Centers, each of which also benefits in its own way from continued demand for oil and gas.\n\nThe company's regular reporting doesn't provide a great deal of detail as to how these units perform. Berkshire Hathaway does, however, confirm that its gas pipelines and its non-utility energy businesses each reliably add more than $1 billion to the conglomerate's annual operating income, or about 5% of its GAAP bottom line. That's not insignificant, particularly when added to the conglomerate's sizable positions in conventional energy stocks.\n\nMore to the point for interested investors, Berkshire is a clever way of taking on a fair amount of exposure to the energy sector without also taking on its volatility and unpredictability.\n\nAn easy, backdoor way to invest in the energy sector\n\nIt's obviously not the only way to plug into the sector's future, which is suddenly more promising than it was just a few days ago. An energy-focused ETF like the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLE) or the Vanguard Energy ETF(NYSEMKT: VDE) will do the trick nicely as well.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that while Goldman Sachs expects usage of oil to continue growing through 2040, that doesn't mean prices will necessarily follow. Goldman Sachs believes that WTI crude prices will actually slip to an average of $53 per barrel next year, down from a little over $60 right now, thanks to a swell of new supply that will reach the market in the meantime. Lower crude prices make drilling oil and refining it less profitable.\n\nThey don't make it unprofitable though, and oil and gas prices have very little effect on the profitability of Berkshire's wholly owned pipelines and its oil-related brands and services.\n\nBottom line? If Goldman Sachs' outlook has you looking for an easy way to scoop up more exposure to the energy sector, Berkshire Hathaway is a surprising and easy-to-own way of doing it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

CEO Warren Buffett generally avoids tech stocks, as he largely focuses on companies in consumer goods, financials, and industrials. He is stepping down as CEO at the end of the year, and this could be a sign of a greater acceptance of tech moving forward.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway \u203a\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) has, for the most part, been selling stocks for much of the year, with its cash balance hitting record levels. CEO Warren Buffett doesn't appear to have been finding many bargains out there worth pursuing.\n\nThat's why Berkshire's latest move raised some eyebrows: adding Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) to its portfolio. Buffett generally avoids tech stocks, which leads many analysts to conclude the purchase wasn't made by him. And this could be a sign of many more changes to come, especially since the billionaire investor is stepping down at the end of the year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBuffett regretted not investing in Alphabet earlier\n\nAccording to Berkshire's 13F filing, the company owns approximately 17.8 million shares of Alphabet as of the end of September.\n\nAlphabet is what I'd consider to be a prototypical Buffett stock. It has two highly popular assets in Google Search and YouTube, which have strong competitive advantages that the billionaire investor often seeks out when finding blue chip stocks to invest in. They also have what he refers to as a \"share of mind,\" in that people often think of those brands and generally have good feelings about them.\n\nIn years past, Buffett admits to missing out on Google. And his partner, the late Charlie Munger, said that \"we just sat there sucking our thumbs,\" admitting that they saw the success the business had become, but failed to pull the trigger.\n\nThe big reason Buffett may have passed on the tech giant in the past is because he isn't overly comfortable investing in tech stocks; it's not within what he would say is in his \"circle of competence\" -- something he suggests investors stay within, to ensure they aren't investing in businesses they aren't familiar with.\n\nCould this move be a sign of greater changes ahead?\n\nFor Berkshire to now invest in Alphabet suggests to me that perhaps Greg Abel, Berkshire's incoming CEO, may be more willing to have the stock be among the company's top holdings. It could be a sign that, at the very least, there's going to be a greater appetite for tech stocks in Berkshire's portfolio in the near future, so Buffett didn't oppose this latest buy.\n\nThere are tech stocks in Berkshire's portfolio, but they are generally more modest positions. Amazon is a holding, but it accounts for just 0.7% of the entire portfolio. Alphabet, meanwhile, accounts for 1.7% right now. It's quickly become one of the larger holdings in the Berkshire portfolio, and I believe there could be more tech stocks to find their way there in the coming months.\n\nWhile this doesn't mean Berkshire's new management is necessarily going in a completely different direction than Buffett, but with different competencies, the new CEO may simply be more comfortable holding more of a position in tech.\n\nWhy a transition to tech could make Berkshire's stock an even better buy\n\nBerkshire's portfolio is full of recognizable consumer brands, which, unfortunately, may not make for great investments anymore. While Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz are well-known businesses and are top Berkshire holdings, both have significantly underperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) in the past five years; the former is up over 33%, while the latter has declined by 21%. By comparison, the broad index is up more than 83% during that time frame.\n\nA transition away from these types of slower-growing businesses and into more tech stocks could be a move that ends up paying off for investors. I wouldn't be surprised to see more of these types of moves in the future for Berkshire, as a change in management could mean a different mix of stocks for the company.\n\nWhile Buffett leaving the company may have investors worried about its future, I'm optimistic it could help reenergize its portfolio and lead to better returns in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

So, when a company can continue to pay shareholders more year in and year out, it's generally a strong indication of a business with consistent growth and durable competitive advantages.\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae represent S&P 500 companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years (the term Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC).\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nHere are three Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae that exhibit the growth opportunities and strong financials to double their dividends over the long term.\n\nThese are stocks you may want to buy and hold.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. S&P Global\n\nS&P Global(NYSE: SPGI), the parent company of what once was Standard & Poor's, is at the core of the financial sector. It offers a wide range of financial data and analytics services, including its role as a central authority on bond ratings. The company has built a reputation since its founding in the 1800s, creating a brand moat that investors worldwide trust.\n\nDebt is the oxygen that keeps the global economy alive, and financial markets seldom sleep. As a result, S&P Global continuously produces stable, highly profitable revenue that translates into clockwork-like dividends. The company has gone beyond being a Dividend Aristocrat\u00ae, becoming a Dividend King with 51 consecutive annual dividend hikes.\n\nBut even with decades of increases to its name, there's room for more. The stock's dividend payout ratio is still just 22% of S&P Global's 2025 earnings estimates. As the world continues to borrow money, analysts see S&P Global growing its earnings per share (EPS) by 11% annually over the next three to five years. That positions the stock's dividend to double over the next six to seven years at that pace.\n\n2. Aflac\n\nNo insurance product covers all your needs. Aflac(NYSE: AFL) has built a very successful company by filling in those gaps for its customers. Aflac sells supplementary insurance products, including policies covering accidents, cancer, short-term disability, and life insurance. Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and is known for its famous duck mascot.\n\nInsurance is all about gauging risk. Aflac's dividend track record is a testament to the company's policy-underwriting skill. You don't increase your dividend for 43 consecutive years if you suffer catastrophic losses. Aflac is profitable enough that it can raise its dividend and still spend enough to buy back stock, lowering its share count by a whopping 38% over the past decade.\n\nThere's probably more where this all came from. Aflac's dividend payout ratio is modest at just under 33% of estimated 2025 earnings, and analysts predict the business will grow earnings at an annualized rate of 5% moving forward. Investors are looking at the dividend potentially doubling over the next 14 to 15 years, while those buybacks help boost the share price along the way.\n\n3. Chubb Limited\n\nChubb Limited(NYSE: CB) is one of the world's largest insurance companies. It operates in over 50 countries and sells a range of insurance products, including personal and commercial property, accident, supplemental health, and life insurance. The company dates back to the 1880s, so it has been in business for a very long time and has built a reputation across the insurance industry.\n\nIt has also become a Warren Buffett stock after Berkshire Hathaway opened a stake in Chubb back in late 2023, steadily building it into one of its core holdings, now worth over $9.2 billion. Buffett loves dividend stocks, and Chubb certainly fits that bill. The company has raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years.\n\nChubb Limited is a slow-and-steady stock; analysts see the company growing earnings at an annualized rate of just over 4% over the next three to five years.

Here's How Warren Buffett Is Preparing.", "content": "Key Points\n\nWarren Buffett is building up his cash position. Investors may be wise to follow Buffett's lead.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett has long advised against market timing. After all, over time, markets tend to go up. Every time you take your money out of the market, therefore, the odds say that you'll be missing a profitable day. But all of this doesn't mean that Buffett stays fully invested all of the time. In fact, right now, Buffett's portfolio is more cautiously invested than it has been in decades. With a record $381.6 billion in cash, roughly one-third of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) entire market cap is now tied up in cash.\n\nBuffett isn't just holding on to record amounts of cash. He's also selling down some of his top holdings. And last quarter, he refused to repurchase any Berkshire stock -- a practice he has often done in recent years.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nIt's not hard to see what is making Buffett so nervous. Just look at the S&P 500. Based on three different key metrics, the stock market appears grossly overvalued -- a possible warning of a coming market correction.\n\n1. The S&P 500's dividend yield is nearing all-time lows\n\nMonitoring the S&P 500's dividend yield can lead to surprising observations. Right now, the market is fascinated with artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. In general, these stocks don't pay very high dividends. Instead, they retain their earnings to reinvest back into their businesses, businesses that are growing very rapidly.\n\nToday, AI stocks represent a huge percentage of the S&P 500's value. The top five companies in that index now represent roughly 30% of its entire value. All five are tech giants heavily exposed to AI. Because these companies pay minimal dividends, the overall dividend yield for the S&P 500 is near all-time lows. Right now, the dividend yield for the entire index is around 1.17%. The last time its dividend yield was this low was during the peak of the dot-com bubble, when yields bottomed at 1.11%.\n\nBut there's another reason why the S&P 500's dividend yield is so low: a historically high valuation on earnings.\n\n2. Marketwide price-to-earnings ratios are looking very pricey\n\nIf stocks are priced cheaply, typically, marketwide dividends are high. Consider a company that earns $2 per share and pays out $1 per share in dividends. If the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 10, the stock would be valued at $20 per share, with a dividend yield of 5%. But if shares were priced at 30 times earnings, the stock would be valued at $30 per share, with a dividend yield of just 3.3%.\n\nRight now, the S&P 500 trades at roughly 30 times earnings -- nearly double its long-term trading average. Even if you just consider the last two decades of data, the S&P 500 now trades at a price-to-earnings multiple that rivals only the 2020 pandemic market rally, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2000 dot-com bubble.\n\nSimply tracking the market's price-to-earnings ratio, however, has some limitations. That's why it's important to monitor lesser-known metrics like the data discussed below.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\n3. This lesser-known metric is also sounding the alarm\n\nRobert Shiller is an economist and professor at Yale University. He is famous for his Shiller P/E ratio. This ratio is based on the average inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous decade. It's also known as the Cyclically Adjusted PE Ratio, or CAPE Ratio. It basically tries to smooth out earnings by using a 10-year, inflation-adjusted average so you're not fooled by one unusually good or bad year.\n\nAccording to Shiller's adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, the stock market looks even more expensive than by using traditional metrics. This ratio currently stands at 39.34. The last time it reached such heights was during the peak of the dot-com bubble.\n\nTo be certain, no one knows when the next market correction will come. But several key metrics are sounding the alarm. Warren Buffett's response has been to build up cash, sell down key positions, and decline to buy back shares of the company he understands best: Berkshire Hathaway. If you're worried about the future, it may be time to get more defensive with your investment strategy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

The payment processor just rewarded shareholders with over $22 billion in stock buybacks and dividends.10 stocks we like better than Visa \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) holds positions in over 40 publicly traded companies, six of which are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI).\n\nThe Dow has 30 components in total, and four out of five of Berkshire's largest holdings are Dow stocks: Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nAdditionally, Berkshire owns Amazon, which was added to the Dow last year, and Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nHere's why Visa is my top buy of these six names for 2026.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA high-margin cash cow\n\nBerkshire's public equity portfolio is worth approximately $302 billion. But its controlled businesses are arguably even more valuable. The crown jewel is its property and casualty insurance businesses. Given Berkshire's expertise in finding value in the financial sector, it's no surprise that it owns all three of the major credit card companies -- American Express, Visa, and Mastercard.\n\nVisa is the largest of the three, both in terms of market capitalization and transaction volume. The more cards that enter the Visa network, the greater the incentive for merchants worldwide to accept Visa, which boosts revenue that can be used to partner with even more financial institutions, in turn leading to more card issuances. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Visa is converting nearly half of its revenue into free cash flow (FCF) -- which showcases just how efficiently its business operates.\n\nV Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nVisa's main expenses are related to maintaining and expanding its network, labor, and marketing. It's a very capital-light business model, especially considering that Visa partners with financial institutions to issue cards. By not issuing its own cards, Visa doesn't have to worry about bearing the credit risk. So it's not liable for how responsibly or irresponsibly its card users manage their spending.\n\nAnother benefit is that it doesn't have to pay its users rewards. That's also done by financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase's Chase Sapphire and Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Bank of America Customer Cash Rewards card, or the Wells Fargo Active Cash card, which are all Visa cards. By comparison, American Express spends more than double on cardmember perks than it collects in annual fees (but it makes up for that shortfall in other ways).\n\nVisa passes along its free cash flow to shareholders\n\nVisa's high-margin business makes it arguably the greatest cash cow in the financial services industry.\n\nBecause Visa has low capital expenditures, it is able to convert nearly all of its operating cash flow into FCF. Visa returns that FCF to shareholders through dividends and more, importantly, stock buybacks. Metric Full Year Fiscal 2025 Net cash provided by operating activities $23.06 billion Capital expenditures $1.48 billion Free cash flow $21.58 billion Share repurchases $18.19 billion Dividends $4.63 billion\n\nData source: Visa. Fiscal year 2025 ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn Visa's 2025 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2025, the company returned roughly 4 times more cash through stock buybacks than dividends. Here lies Visa's ace in the hole. By using its FCF on buybacks over dividends, Visa consistently reduces its share count. With fewer shares to go around, Visa's earnings per share increase from the core business growing earnings as well as through a lower outstanding share count.\n\nBuybacks are a significant reason why Visa is still a good value. Despite Visa's stock price increasing over fourfold in the last decade, Visa's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still just 32.3 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is lower than its 10-year median P/E of 34.3.\n\nIf Visa were to reallocate share repurchases toward dividends, it would yield a whopping 3.6% instead of its actual yield of 0.8%. However, long-term investors would prefer Visa to continue buying back stock disproportionately and paying a relatively small dividend, as it's a better use of capital if the stock continues to perform well.\n\nYou can count on Visa in 2026 and beyond\n\nVisa checks all the boxes of a high-quality stock to buy now. Major indexes, such as the S&P 500, sport relatively expensive valuations because many of the largest companies by market capitalization have seen their stock prices rise faster than earnings, which puts pressure on these companies to deliver on expectations.\n\nVisa doesn't have that problem because its valuation is reasonable. And yet, it's not a stodgy, low-growth stock like Coca-Cola, where investors can only pencil in mid-single-digit annual earnings growth. Visa should continue to grow earnings in the low double digits per year, even if consumer spending declines.\n\nAdd it all up, and Visa is one of my highest-conviction buys for 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ: POOL) fits the bill. The company is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool equipment, parts, and supplies.\n\nBut that's not all there is to know about the company. Here's what you should know before you consider buying in.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nKnow where Pool's money comes from\n\nAbout one-third of Pool's revenue comes from new pool installations, which have declined over the past few years after seeing a huge boom during the pandemic lockdowns. Because most residential pool installations occur when a home is built, the same high interest rates that have led to a housing slowdown have depressed growth on this side of Pool's business.\n\nThe remaining two-thirds comes from sales related to maintenance and repair of existing pools. That revenue tends to be recurring, because even a homeowner who doesn't use their pool needs to maintain it so it doesn't turn into an algae-infested swamp. This should also give investors confidence that even if new pool installations remain sluggish -- as they have been in the post-lockdown era -- the company will still be able to fund its dividend, which currently yields about 2.1%\n\nKnow you're paying less than Buffett\n\nAt its current price of about $233 a share, Pool's stock is trading at a price it hasn't seen since early 2020. It's even trading well below its five-year average price of $372 a share:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has recently been buying Pool shares, but it paid much more for them. In fact, the lowest Berkshire could have possibly paid for any of its shares -- if it had timed the market perfectly during Q2 2025 -- was $285 a share. On the other hand, if Berkshire had had very bad timing, it could have paid as much as $390.03 a share for some of its Pool stock.\n\nThat means that investors who buy shares of Pool today are getting a discount of between 18.2% and 40.2% to what Buffett paid. That's a compelling offer.\n\nKnow it's a marathon, not a sprint\n\nThe reason Pool's stock price has sunk so far from Berkshire's buying price -- and so very far from its 2021 high of $578 a share -- is the outlook for the real estate market.\n\nTrue, the majority of Pool's revenue comes from maintenance and repair of existing pools, which doesn't have anything to do with the real estate market. However, because the company is a distributor of parts and supplies and not a manufacturer, there's a limit to how much it can hike prices before customers simply go elsewhere. That means the only way to meaningfully grow maintenance and repair revenue is to grow the number of pools to service.\n\nBut pool installations usually only come when the housing market is strong, which isn't likely to be the case for a while. Investors who buy shares of Pool now should be ready to wait years for the housing market to recover, relying on Pool's dividend (currently yielding 2.1%) to tide them over in the meantime.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pool right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Pool, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Pool wasn\u2019t one of them.

Alphabet is both cheaper and growing faster than Apple. 10 stocks we like better than Alphabet \u203a\n\nWatching what Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) are doing is a popular investing strategy. While the CEO is stepping down at the end of the year and handing the reins to this trillion-dollar company to Greg Abel, he's still making investment moves.\n\nAt one point in time, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made up over half of Berkshire's investment portfolio. However, management has sold off that position to raise cash and invest in some other businesses. During the third quarter, Berkshire continued this trend, selling nearly 42 million shares of Apple, reducing its holdings by about 15%. Still, Apple is its largest position and makes up over 20% of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nThat sale allows Berkshire to add a new position to its investment portfolio: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Alphabet is another trillion-dollar business and has been a long-term successful stock pick. I think this is a genius move, as Apple has been struggling to grow for years while Alphabet continues to grow even as its business has matured.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAlphabet's long-term prospects are brighter than Apple's\n\nApple's product lineup mostly consists of consumer hardware, although it's making some waves in the streaming business. Alphabet's business revolves around advertising, but it also has other investments like cloud computing, self-driving vehicles (Waymo), consumer hardware, quantum computing, and generative artificial intelligence (AI). While Apple's business has been wildly successful, it revolves around trying to upsell to a consumer who's already strapped for cash. It hasn't released a new device that opens another market for Apple, and its artificial intelligence offering has largely been unsuccessful.\n\nAlphabet's business units have been successful, even if they've reached full maturity. The Google Search engine has been around for decades, and many investors were worried about Google losing market share to AI earlier this year. However, Google has proven time and time again that it's a force to be reckoned with, and it won't quietly fade away. It has integrated AI search overviews into the search engine, seamlessly combining generative AI into traditional search -- the best of both worlds. Alphabet's cloud computing platform (Google Cloud) has also been a stalwart, and Q3 revenue rose 34% year over year.\n\nThe strength and growth of Alphabet's business are apparent when compared to Apple's.\n\nGOOGL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nAlphabet has long posted stronger growth than Apple, and that pattern is unlikely to change unless Apple can launch a new innovative product. Despite this stronger growth rate, Alphabet's stock was far cheaper.\n\nBerkshire's Alphabet purchase came a few months ago\n\nAny company with more than $100 million in investments must file a Form 13F that discloses its moves. This information is made available to the public 45 days after the quarter ends. So, the price Berkshire paid for Alphabet and sold Apple at isn't what you can buy and sell them for today. This is something to keep in mind, as Alphabet's prices between July 1 and September 30 were generally much lower than they are now.\n\nGOOGL data by YCharts\n\nFor instance, when Alphabet traded for $200 per share during August, it had a bargain price tag of about 19 times forward earnings. Now, it's more expensive at 26 times forward earnings. That's still a cheaper price tag than Apple despite significantly stronger growth and a brighter future.\n\nAs a result, I think investors can make the move to sell Apple stock and buy Alphabet, much like Berkshire did during Q3. However, you won't get quite as good a deal on Alphabet's stock as the market has gotten quite a bit more bullish on it since its monopoly court case was resolved, and investors have realized that Alphabet is an AI leader, not an AI loser. Alphabet is one of the top stocks to buy in the market, and this move by Berkshire proves it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Despite being a long-term optimist who won't bet against America, Buffett has been an aggressive net seller of stocks for three years -- and valuation looks to be the key reason why. Being patient and waiting for price dislocations is a strategy that's worked wonders for the Oracle of Omaha and Berkshire's shareholders. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway \u203a\n\nOne of the most illustrious investing careers on Wall Street is officially in its twilight. Billionaire Warren Buffett is set to step down from his role as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when the calendar changes to 2026, ending a 60-year run where he presided over day-to-day operations and what's currently a $309 billion investment portfolio.\n\nBerkshire's shareholders will be sad to see the Oracle of Omaha leave due to his phenomenal investing track record. He's nearly doubled the average annual return of the S&P 500, including dividends, over the last six decades.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nBut professional and everyday investors will miss him, too. Buffett has always been upfront about his investing philosophy and candid regarding the traits that make businesses great.\n\nWhile Berkshire's billionaire boss would never bet against America or the U.S. stock market, his actions sometimes speak louder than his words.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWarren Buffett's $382 billion warning to Wall Street has hit a deafening roar\n\nLengthy books have been written outlining the characteristics and traits the Oracle of Omaha looks for when taking a stake in a public company. Examples include sustainable moats, trusted management teams, and businesses that offer hearty capital-return programs (dividends and/or share buybacks).\n\nOnce in a while, Buffett will bend one of his unwritten rules. For example, he piled into gaming company Activision Blizzard in 2022 as an arbitrage opportunity. Microsoft had made a $95-per-share all-cash offer to acquire Activision, and shares of the company were trading well below this buyout price, primarily due to antitrust concerns. Despite being an advocate for long-term investing, Berkshire's chief made a short-term wager in this instance.\n\nHowever, one aspect of Buffett's investment philosophy that remains unbreakable is his desire to get a good deal. Nothing is more important than stock valuations -- and Buffett's trading activity shows it.\n\nIn each of the last 12 quarters (Oct. 1, 2022 \u2013 Sept. 30, 2025), Berkshire Hathaway's consolidated cash flow statements show that Warren Buffett has sold more stock than he's purchased, to the cumulative tune of $184 billion. Selling this much stock, coupled with the cash flow generated from Berkshire's owned assets, has boosted the company's combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries to approximately $382 billion, as of the end of September.\n\nAlthough Buffett isn't the type to stoke fear in the investing community, his persistent selling and now-$382 billion treasure chest unequivocally signal his displeasure with valuations on Wall Street.\n\nWarren Buffett Indicator hits a new all-time high of 223%, the most expensive stock market valuation in history \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 pic.twitter.com/p14CI3VXGu -- Barchart (@Barchart) October 26, 2025\n\nIf there was any doubt that stocks are pricey, the famed Buffett indicator can quell these skeptics. The Buffett indicator divides the aggregate market cap of all publicly traded companies in the U.S. by the country's gross domestic product (GDP). The lower the ratio, the \"cheaper\" stocks are presumed to be.\n\nWhen back-tested to 1970, this valuation tool, which Buffett referred to as \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\" in an interview with Fortune magazine in 2001, has averaged a reading of 85%. To put this into perspective, the market value of all public companies has averaged 85% of U.S. GDP over 55 years. In late October, the Buffett indicator surged above 225%, marking an all-time high.\n\nWarren Buffett's actions clearly indicate that value is incredibly difficult to come by at the moment. Although he is finding small pockets of value -- he's purchased shares of fast-food favorite Domino's Pizzafor five consecutive quarters -- multiple potential bubbles, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and Bitcoin treasury companies, have made stock valuations unappealing.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nPatience has worked wonders for the Oracle of Omaha\n\nConsidering that investing Berkshire's cash has been the source of the company's long-term outperformance of the S&P 500, investors are probably none-too-thrilled with this wait-and-see approach currently being exercised by the Oracle of Omaha. However, being patient and maintaining a long-term perspective have been the keys to Buffett's success as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBerkshire's soon-to-be-retiring boss is well aware of the nonlinear nature of economic and stock market cycles and has planned his sizable investments accordingly throughout his tenure.\n\nNo amount of fiscal or monetary policy maneuvering can prevent recessions and economic slowdowns from occasionally taking place. On the other hand, the average recession since the end of World War II has endured roughly 10 months. This compares to the typical economic expansion, which lasts for about five years. Packing Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio with cyclical businesses has positioned Buffett's company to capitalize on the disproportionate nature of economic cycles.\n\nBull and bear markets on Wall Street demonstrate this same disparity.\n\nAccording to a data set from the analysts at Bespoke Investment Group, the average S&P 500 bear market between the start of the Great Depression in September 1929 and June 2023 is just 286 calendar days, or roughly 9.5 months. In comparison, the average S&P 500 bull market has endured 3.5 times as long (1,011 calendar days).\n\nKnowing that time is on Berkshire Hathaway's side, Warren Buffett has been willing to sit on his proverbial hands and wait for price dislocations to appear before pouncing. This patience allowed Buffett to secure a $5 billion investment in Bank of America shortly after the financial crisis in August 2011.\n\nAlthough Buffett is unlikely to be the one who eventually deploys a good portion of Berkshire Hathaway's $382 billion treasure chest -- he's retiring as CEO in less than six weeks -- incoming CEO Greg Abel has vowed to keep the long-term ethos that Buffett championed firmly in place. When the next short-lived panic or bear market does arrive, Berkshire Hathaway will be there as an anchor of optimism for long-term-minded investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

Had you invested just $500 in Berkshire stock when he took the helm and held on, you would be sitting on a position worth around $25.2 million today. That same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $196,656.\n\nFortunately for investors, Buffett will continue to serve as Berkshire's chairman, and he has trained his successor, Greg Abel, in his methods. So his brand of long-term value investing is likely to endure at the conglomerate for quite some time.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nBuffett's specialty is finding companies with steady growth, reliable profits, and experienced management teams, and investing in them for many years. His preference is to stick with businesses that he understands, which is one big reason why, historically, he has typically shied away from technology companies.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a moniker that investors have bestowed upon a group of trillion-dollar U.S. companies that have a penchant for outperforming the rest of the market -- are all, in one way or another, tech stocks. They are Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.\n\nAnd despite the fact that they are in many ways outside his wheelhouse, Buffett and his team have bought three Magnificent Seven stocks since 2016. One, in particular, they just added in the last few months. Together, those three stocks represent 23.4% of the total value of Berkshire's $309 billion equity portfolio. Here's what they are.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon is one of the most diverse companies in the technology space, with dominant presences in e-commerce, cloud computing, streaming, and digital advertising. Like most of its peers, it is now spending hundreds of billions of dollars in the fight for supremacy in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.\n\nThe tech giant's cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is at the center of its AI strategy. AWS operates data centers fitted with thousands of advanced chips from top suppliers like Nvidia, but it also designed its own AI-accelerator chips, Trainium and Inferentia, which are more affordable for developers to rent. Anthropic, which is one of the world's top AI start-ups, is now training its latest Claude models using Trainium2 chips.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter, an increase of 20% year over year. It was the unit's fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022. Amazon is on track to spend around $125 billion on AI data center construction this year as it attempts to fulfill a whopping $200 billion order backlog from AWS customers who are waiting for additional cloud computing infrastructure to come online.\n\nBerkshire first invested in Amazon in 2019, but Buffett has expressed regret for failing to identify the opportunity sooner. Fortunately, Berkshire will benefit from Amazon's next leg of growth, which is likely to be fueled by AI.\n\n2. Alphabet: 1.6% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, and Waymo, and it's the newest Magnificent Seven stock in Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett and his team purchased a nearly $5 billion stake in the tech giant during the third quarter.\n\nInitially, onlookers viewed the rising use of AI as a risk to Alphabet because chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT had the potential to sap traffic from Google Search, which consistently accounts for more than half of Alphabet's revenue. But the company infused its search engine with its own family of large language models (LLMs) called Gemini to create new features like AI Overviews and AI Mode, which combine traditional search results with AI-generated content.\n\nAlphabet says these features have been a success in terms of usership and monetization, but they are just one part of the company's AI strategy. A growing number of developers are flocking to Google Cloud to access the data center computing capacity and ready-made LLMs (including Gemini) they need to create AI software. This helped drive 34% revenue growth for the platform in the third quarter. It was the second consecutive quarter in which that growth rate accelerated.\n\nShares of Alphabet are trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.2 as I write this, making it the second-cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. Since Buffett loves value, it's no surprise the tech giant found its way into Berkshire's portfolio.\n\n3. Apple: 21% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple remains Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding. It actually accounted for around half of the conglomerate's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, before Buffett and his team went on a selling spree. Berkshire spent around $38 billion acquiring its stake in Apple between 2016 and 2023, and since the value of the position peaked at over $170 billion, taking some profits off the table was simply smart portfolio management.\n\nApple's latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers are built for the AI era. The company designs its own advanced chips for each device, which deliver the computing power required to run its new Apple Intelligence software. This includes an expanding suite of AI apps and features that can summarize texts and emails, generate images, and prioritize notifications based on each user's preferences.\n\nApple's new iPhone 17 lineup features its most powerful chips so far, and it's driving a much better upgrade cycle than Wall Street expected. But looking at the bigger picture, there are 2.35 billion active Apple devices globally, so the company could eventually become the world's biggest distributor of AI software to consumers.\n\nTherefore, Berkshire can still do very well from here despite having drastically reduced its Apple stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett's new quantum computing favorite\n\nBy using the word \"new,\" I implied that Buffett already had a favorite quantum computing stock. That's true. Prior to the third quarter of 2025, his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio featured one (and only one) stock of a company that's investing in quantum computing. I'm referring to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nEarlier this year, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the development of a new quantum computing chip called Ocelot, which can significantly reduce the costs associated with quantum error correction. AWS also offers cloud-based quantum computing services via its Amazon Braket platform.\n\nHowever, Berkshire is now invested in another company involved in quantum computing. In Q3, the conglomerate bought more than 17.8 million Class A shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). This stake in Alphabet is worth more than $5 billion, more than twice the size of Berkshire's position in Amazon. Voila! Buffett has a new favorite quantum computing stock.\n\nAlphabet's Google Quantum AI ranks among the leaders in advancing quantum computing technology. In 2019, the unit achieved its first major quantum computing milestone by performing a calculation in 200 seconds that it said would have taken the most widely used algorithms running on the most powerful supercomputers around 10,000 years to complete. Four years later, Google Quantum AI demonstrated for the first time a prototype of a logical qubit and showed how quantum error correction could reduce errors in quantum computing as more qubits are added.\n\nA lot more than quantum computing\n\nDid Buffett (or one of Berkshire's two other investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) initiate a new position in Alphabet because of its quantum computing efforts? Probably not.\n\nIt's much more likely that Buffett and his team liked Alphabet's rock-solid advertising business. In the third quarter of 2025, advertising on Google, YouTube, the Google Network, and other platforms generated a whopping $74.2 billion of revenue.\n\nEight years ago, Buffett acknowledged that he regretted not buying shares of Google earlier. He said then that he should have recognized the company's great advertising business. His longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, was even more direct, stating, \"I feel like a horse's ass for not identifying Google earlier ... We screwed up.\"\n\nDoes Buffett have to understand the technology behind Google Search of Alphabet's other apps to appreciate the value of its business? Not at all. He knows that attracting billions of users creates an audience that advertisers will pay big bucks to reach.\n\nShould you buy Alphabet stock, too?\n\nNo one should buy any stock solely because a famous investor bought it. However, I think Alphabet is a great pick for Buffett and for other investors.\n\nThe company's advertising business remains strong. Alphabet is using artificial intelligence (AI) to its advantage. In particular, the integration of generative AI functionality into Google search appears to be paying off.\n\nAI is also serving as a huge tailwind for Google Cloud. The just-announced launch of Google Gemini 3.0, its most powerful large language model (LLM) yet, could accelerate Google Cloud's momentum.\n\nI also like the prospects for Alphabet's Waymo business. Waymo is the leader in the autonomous ride-hailing service market and continues to expand into new cities.\n\nAnd, yes, I think quantum computing could present a major opportunity for Alphabet in the future. Alphabet isn't just Buffett's favorite quantum computing stock; it's mine, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Interest rates significantly impact this group because they affect key components of their business, including funding costs, loan and investment activity, and more.\n\nWhile every stock is impacted by the macroeconomic environment, this is the best financial stock to hold in times of uncertainty.\n\nA durable, diverse business\n\nOf course, I am referring to Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), one of the world's largest conglomerates, led by the legendary Warren Buffett, who will step down as CEO at the end of the year. Berkshire is the best of the best because it operates many unique yet strong businesses, making it a safe haven in times of duress.\n\nAt the core of the business is Berkshire's strong property and casualty insurance business, which generated over $22.6 billion in net earnings in 2024. This business also generates float from insurance premiums that Berkshire can use to fund its massive $300 billion-plus equities portfolio, which is led by some of the world's preeminent investors.\n\nOther businesses at Berkshire Hathaway like the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy brought in roughly $5 billion and $3.7 billion of net earnings, respectively, while the conglomerate's manufacturing, servicing, and retailing businesses generated over $13 billion of net earnings in 2024.\n\nLast but not least is Berkshire's fortress balance sheet, which reported over $377 billion of cash and short-term government bonds at the end of the third quarter. Berkshire's diverse revenue streams, fortress balance sheet, and strong management team make it the safest financial stock to hold during uncertain times.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

Is It the Best AI Bet Right Now?", "content": "Key Points\n\nDespite a reputation for resisting tech stocks, Warren Buffett's company now holds shares in Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. Its new stake in Alphabet is twice as large as Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Amazon. Alphabet offers a fast-growing cloud computing division and generates billions in advertising revenue each quarter.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet \u203a\n\nThere's a new stock in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. The company, which has been led for six decades by its famed CEO Warren Buffett, disclosed it purchased 17.86 million shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), in a stake valued at $5.18 billion.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nThe investment is a departure from Buffett, who has previously expressed hesitation about buying tech stocks. However, Buffett has softened his tone on the sector in recent years, and this investment suggests that even in the twilight of his career, the Oracle of Omaha knows a good investment when he sees one.\n\nImage source: Alphabet.\n\nBuffett's evolution on tech stocks\n\nWhile it's unclear if it was Buffett or one of his lieutenants who pulled the trigger on Alphabet stock, Buffett has long resisted investing in the company. In 1999, Buffett showed reluctance toward internet stocks in general. \"The internet will have a huge impact on the world, but I'm not sure that it makes it an easy investment decision,\" he said at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting.\n\nTwo decades later, an interviewer asked Buffett specifically about Google (as Alphabet was then known) and Apple. He called them \"extraordinary companies,\" but that didn't change his overall stance. \"I would not be at all surprised to see them be worth a lot more money 10 years from now, but I wouldn't want to buy either one of them,\" he said.\n\nOf course, Buffett later became a major investor in Apple, and Berkshire Hathaway continues to hold nearly $64 million shares of Apple stock -- the conglomerate's biggest single holding. Berkshire Hathaway eventually took a smaller stake in another tech stock, purchasing 10 million shares of Amazon, now worth $2.3 billion.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's investment in Alphabet\n\nNotably, Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Alphabet is twice the size of the company's bet on Amazon. Both companies are leading hyperscalers, actively expanding their data center capacity to meet the demand of companies and developers creating artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, as well as clients who want cloud or hybrid environments.\n\nGoogle Cloud has a 13% market share in the global cloud computing market, trailing both Amazon Web Services (29%) and Microsoft Azure (20%).  The business is both lucrative and growing rapidly, reporting $15.15 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 33% increase from the same period a year ago.\n\nBut Alphabet is much more than that as well. Alphabet earned $102.34 billion in revenue in the third quarter, with 72% of that coming from its powerful advertising network, which includes Google Search, YouTube advertising, and the Google Network. All in all, advertising revenues were up 12.6% from a year ago.\n\nWhy Alphabet makes sense in a Berkshire Hathaway portfolio\n\nThere are many similarities between Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. All of them have strong ecosystems, loyal customers, and dominant market shares (Alphabet has a 90% share in global internet search, and its Chrome browser has a 73% market share.)\n\nWhile Buffett isn't the most tech-savvy investor, he knows good businesses, and he's not afraid to change his mind. Alphabet provides multiple streams of revenue, strong profits, and has a long-term growth window -- making this AI stock an ideal pick for Berkshire Hathaway today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.
