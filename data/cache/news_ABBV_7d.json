All of them have attractive dividend yields. Four of these stocks have increased their dividends for at least 19 consecutive years. 10 stocks we like better than AbbVie \u203a\n\nAre you retired or almost there and seeking a steady income stream? Is retirement still well in the future, but you want to invest in stocks that can deliver solid total returns? If the answer to either of those questions is \"yes,\" I have good news for you.\n\nOut of the thousands of dividend stocks on the market, some rise to the top. Here are five dividend stocks, in particular, that I think are excellent picks to hold for the next 10 years.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nPerhaps the most important thing to know about AbbVie(NYSE: ABBV) is that it's a member of the elite group of stocks known as Dividend Kings. To join this group, a stock must increase its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. AbbVie's track record of consecutive dividend increases currently stands at 53 years. Its dividend yield of almost 3% is also attractive.\n\nBut AbbVie's appeal isn't limited to its dividend. The big pharma company is poised for solid growth over the next few years, thanks to blockbuster drugs with soaring sales, especially autoimmune disease therapies Rinvoq and Skyrizi.\n\n2. Ares Capital\n\nAres Capital's (NASDAQ: ARCC) forward dividend yield of 9.8% might be so high that some investors become acrophobic. However, this business development company (BDC) has maintained or grown its dividend for more than 16 consecutive years. I expect this streak will continue with Ares Capital's history of strong dividend coverage.\n\nThe total addressable market for private lenders is estimated at $5.4 trillion and is expected to continue expanding. Ares Capital is in a great position to capitalize on this opportunity (no pun intended) as the largest publicly traded BDC with long-standing relationships in the market.\n\n3. Enbridge\n\nEnbridge(NYSE: ENB) has increased its dividend for an impressive 30 consecutive years. This energy leader isn't stingy with its payouts, either, with a high forward dividend yield of 5.6%. I believe Enbridge's dividend is about as safe as they come.\n\nThe company's underlying business is low-risk and stable. Enbridge's pipelines transport roughly 30% of the crude oil produced in North America and around 20% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. The company also ranks as the largest natural gas utility in North America based on volume.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe explosion in demand for data centers continues to serve as a key driver of growth for Enbridge. Why? The artificial intelligence (AI) applications hosted by these data centers are power-hungry, and natural gas is the leading fuel for power plants in the U.S.\n\n4. Realty Income\n\nLike Enbridge, Realty Income(NYSE: O) has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years. Even better, the real estate investment trust (REIT) has increased its dividend for 112 consecutive quarters. Want to be more impressed? Realty Income's dividend yield is a lofty 5.7%.\n\nThis top REIT's track record of stability during volatile periods is exemplary. Chalk this achievement up to Realty Income's strong portfolio of properties. The company owns 15,542 properties rented to 1,647 clients representing 92 industries. Realty Income's overall occupancy level has never fallen below 96.6%. Since 2014, its portfolio has experienced only around 0.4% of bad debt expense.\n\nRealty Income's growth prospects might be better than you think, too. Its total addressable market is estimated at $14 trillion. The majority of this opportunity is in Europe, where Realty Income faces little competition.\n\n5. Verizon Communications\n\nVerizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) offers a juicy dividend yield of 6.7%. While this telecommunications giant hasn't increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years like Enbridge and Realty Income, it's no slouch on this front. Verizon recently announced its 19th consecutive annual dividend hike.\n\nI can think of several reasons to hold Verizon stock for the next 10 years, but one is especially interesting to me \u2013 the company's opportunities with 6G networks. Some industry observers predict that 6G networks will become widely available beginning as soon as 2030. These networks could support holograms, extended reality devices, and more. Verizon is leading the charge in developing 6G technology.\n\nShould you buy stock in AbbVie right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AbbVie wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NYSE:ABBV) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AbbVie\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Richard Gonzalez, for US$20m worth of shares, at about US$211 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$236). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 19% of Richard Gonzalez's stake.\n\nInsiders in AbbVie didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nView our latest analysis for AbbVie NYSE:ABBV Insider Trading Volume November 24th 2025\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. AbbVie insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$281m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The AbbVie Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the AbbVie insiders selling. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 5 warning signs for AbbVie you should be aware of.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOf course AbbVie may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The company\u2019s returns over the past year were driven by continued operational strength amid cost concerns and a weak asset quality. Business expansion efforts, loan demand and changes in interest rates will aid net interest income (NII) growth.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst projects\u2019 NII to witness a CAGR of 3.3% by 2027. In investment banking (IB), the company\u2019s solid pipeline and market leadership remain competitive strengths, though capital markets volatility and elevated mortgage rates are likely to weigh on fee income.\r\n\r\nOur estimates for non-interest income don\u2019t show a favorable trend this year. Technology and marketing investments will keep costs elevated. The Zacks analyst expect expenses to reflect a CAGR of 4.4% by 2027. A tough macro backdrop raises concerns about asset quality. We expect provisions to rise 10.5% in 2025.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\r\n\r\nNetflix\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the year-to-date period (+18.9% vs. -59.6%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention.\r\n\r\nNFLX's advertising tier now accounts for more than 55% of new sign-ups in available markets. NFLX has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, supported by a diversified content strategy, including international programming, live events, and gaming initiatives.\r\n\r\nNFLX raised its full-year free cash flow forecast to $9 billion from $8-8.5 billion.

AbbVie has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity (LOE) by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications. These should support top-line growth in the next few years.\r\n\r\nAbbVie is returning to robust revenue growth in 2025, which is just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE. It has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years to bolster its early-stage pipeline that should drive long-term growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company faces several headwinds like Humira LOE impact, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and continued macro headwinds for Aesthetics.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\r\n\r\nOhio Valley Banc\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry over the year-to-date period (+62.5% vs. -1.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $166.30 million is expanding its NIM by reallocating toward higher-yielding commercial and real estate loans and relying on stable, low-cost subsidized deposits that support spread performance.\r\n\r\nTargeted, higher-quality loan growth combined with steady fee income continues to reinforce earnings, while efficiency gains from recent cost-management actions and disciplined capital returns help strengthen overall profitability. Credit metrics remain generally stable. Yet, rising provisioning needs, increased collateral-dependent balances, and reliance on subsidized public deposits introduce added macro sensitivity.\r\n\r\nLoan growth momentum and buyback execution continue to trail peers, tempering near-term confidence. The valuation suggests investors are paying a discounted price for a bank with improving profitability, but balance-sheet and growth risks warrant caution.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Ohio Valley Banc here >>>)\n\nStory Continues\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

You don't need to be as savvy as Buffett to have success in the stock market, because the right index fund can deliver spectacular long-term returns for patient investors. 10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u203a\n\nWarren Buffett will retire from his role as CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway holding company at the end of 2025, where for the last 60 years he has overseen numerous wholly owned subsidiaries, in addition to a stock portfolio that's today worth $300 billion. Had you invested just $500 in Berkshire shares when he took the helm in 1965, it would be worth a staggering $24.8 million today.\n\nHowever, Buffett is a seasoned expert, and he knows the average investor would struggle to replicate his incredible ability to pick stocks. Therefore, he often recommends they buy a low-cost exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks a diversified index like the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) instead.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is one great option he has named in the past. Here's how it could turn a consistent investment of $500 per month into $1 million over the long term.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA great index fund for investors of all experience levels\n\nThe S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy. The index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning its largest constituents have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft are the world's most valuable companies, with a combined market capitalization of $11.9 trillion, and all three are in the information technology sector. Hence, this is the largest sector in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.\n\nHere are the top five sectors in the index, along with their weightings, and some of their most noteworthy stocks.\n\nSector Sector Weighting Noteworthy Stocks Information technology 35.06% Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple Financials 13.03% Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Communication services 10.32% Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Netflix Consumer discretionary 10.05% Amazon, Tesla, McDonald's  Healthcare 9.75% Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie\n\nData source: Vanguard, State Street. Sector weightings are accurate as of Nov. 19, 2025, and are subject to change.\n\nThe other six sectors in the S&P 500 are industrials, consumer staples, energy, utilities, real estate, and materials, so the index is highly diversified.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, it's hard to ignore the significant influence of the information technology sector. The S&P 500 soared by 214% over the last 10 years, and the information technology sector was responsible for more than half of that overall gain, thanks to its own eye-popping return of 640%. In fact, if we exclude the sector entirely, the S&P's return over the last decade shrinks to just 79%.\n\nThis dynamic is likely to remain in place thanks to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, quantum computing, and more, which could fuel significant returns in stocks like Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the most cost-effective ways for investors to gain like-for-like exposure to the S&P 500. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. In dollar terms, an investment of $10,000 would incur an annual fee of just $3, whereas that fee could be as high as $74 in other funds, according to Vanguard.\n\nTurning $500 per month into $1 million\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered a compound annual return of 10.5% since its inception in 1957, and if it continues to grow at that pace, it could turn a consistent monthly investment of $500 into $1 million in under 30 years:\n\nMonthly Investment Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $500 $106,829 $409,298 $1,269,709\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nThe S&P has delivered an even better average annual return of 14.4% over the last five years, as themes like AI fueled incredible growth for some of the index's largest constituents, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and more. Just last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors that annual AI infrastructure spending could hit an eye-popping $4 trillion by 2030, so momentum in this space is unlikely to slow anytime soon.\n\nHowever, even though the S&P might continue generating accelerated returns over the next few years, it's also important to remember that volatility is a normal part of the investing journey. According to Capital Group, the index experiences a decline of 10% or more once every two and a half years, on average, and it slips into a bear market (a decline of 20% or more) every six years. These bumps in the road are the price of admission for an opportunity to earn life-changing returns over the long term.\n\nThe key to success is investing consistently, even during uncertain times. Warren Buffett is known for buying stocks in all market conditions, but especially during periods of weakness because as a value investor, he loves a bargain.\n\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

Following his remarks, the probability of the central bank cutting rates at its December meeting jumped from 39% to over 73%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. This positive sentiment provided relief to markets amid concerns over high valuations, particularly in AI-related stocks.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nTherapeutics company AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) jumped 3.4%.

In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock gained 5.1% on the news that the major indices popped (Nasdaq +3.4%, S&P 500 +2.5%) in response to the positive outcome of U.S.-China trade negotiations, as both sides agreed to pause some tariffs for 90 days, signaling a potential turning point in ongoing tensions. This rollback cuts U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports to 10%, giving companies breathing room to reset inventories and supply chains. However, President Trump clarified that tariffs could go \"substantially higher\" if a full deal with China wasn't reached during the 90-day pause, but not all the way back to the previous levels. Still, the agreement has cooled fears of a prolonged trade war, helping stabilize expectations for global growth and trade flows and fueling renewed optimism. The optimism appeared concentrated in key trade-sensitive sectors, particularly technology, retail, and industrials, as lower tariffs reduce cost pressures and restore cross-border demand.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBiogen is up 17.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $175.80 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Biogen\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $722.31.\n\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can\u2019t build without.

The company\u2019s returns over the past year were driven by continued operational strength amid cost concerns and a weak asset quality. Business expansion efforts, loan demand and changes in interest rates will aid net interest income (NII) growth. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst projects\u2019 NII to witness a CAGR of 3.3% by 2027. In investment banking (IB), the company\u2019s solid pipeline and market leadership remain competitive strengths, though capital markets volatility and elevated mortgage rates are likely to weigh on fee income. \r\n\r\nOur estimates for non-interest income don\u2019t show a favorable trend this year. Technology and marketing investments will keep costs elevated. The Zacks analyst expect expenses to reflect a CAGR of 4.4% by 2027. A tough macro backdrop raises concerns about asset quality. We expect provisions to rise 10.5% in 2025.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\r\n\r\nNetflix\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the year-to-date period (+18.9% vs. -59.6%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention. \r\n\r\nNFLX's advertising tier now accounts for more than 55% of new sign-ups in available markets. NFLX has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, supported by a diversified content strategy, including international programming, live events, and gaming initiatives. \r\n\r\nNFLX raised its full-year free cash flow forecast to $9 billion from $8-8.5 billion. For the fourth-quarter, Netflix projects $11.96 billion in revenue with 16.7% growth and a 23.9% operating margin, featuring major releases including Stranger Things' final season and NFL Christmas games.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of AbbVie have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+34.9% vs. +17.9%). The company beats third-quarter estimates for both earnings and sales. AbbVie has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity (LOE) by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications. These should support top-line growth in the next few years. \r\n\r\nAbbVie is returning to robust revenue growth in 2025, which is just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE. It has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years to bolster its early-stage pipeline that should drive long-term growth. \r\n\r\nHowever, the company faces several headwinds like Humira LOE impact, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and continued macro headwinds for Aesthetics.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\r\n\r\nOhio Valley Banc\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry over the year-to-date period (+62.5% vs. -1.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $166.30 million is expanding its NIM by reallocating toward higher-yielding commercial and real estate loans and relying on stable, low-cost subsidized deposits that support spread performance. \r\n\r\nTargeted, higher-quality loan growth combined with steady fee income continues to reinforce earnings, while efficiency gains from recent cost-management actions and disciplined capital returns help strengthen overall profitability. Credit metrics remain generally stable. Yet, rising provisioning needs, increased collateral-dependent balances, and reliance on subsidized public deposits introduce added macro sensitivity. \r\n\r\nLoan growth momentum and buyback execution continue to trail peers, tempering near-term confidence. The valuation suggests investors are paying a discounted price for a bank with improving profitability, but balance-sheet and growth risks warrant caution.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Ohio Valley Banc here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Equinix, Inc.

Over the past couple of years, AI integration in the U.S. healthcare industry has increased manifold. According to an IDC report commissioned by Microsoft and released in March 2024, 79% of healthcare organizations were already utilizing AI technology.\n\nThis rapid integration has been evident through strategic partnerships between major pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly LLY, Johnson & Johnson JNJ and AbbVie ABBV, and AI-centric tech giants like Palantir PLTR and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nBy accelerating drug discovery, streamlining clinical trials, and automating administrative tasks, these AI collaborations are expected to cut billions in costs, enhance operational efficiency and enable faster breakthroughs. This, in turn, is likely to bolster the underlying healthcare stocks and, by extension, strengthen the performance of healthcare exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide exposure to them.\n\nNow, before suggesting healthcare ETFs that you may consider adding to your portfolio to benefit from AI-driven growth in the sector, let\u2019s take a closer look at these partnerships to understand how AI is transforming the healthcare industry.\n\nNotable Pharma-Tech Collaborations\n\nBig Pharma's accelerated AI adoption is best illustrated by its strategic collaborations with AI-centric tech stocks:\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 In October 2025, it was announced that Eli Lilly is partnering with NVIDIA to build an \"AI Factory,\" leveraging the NVIDIA Blackwell DGX SuperPOD to power the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to drug discovery. This is aimed at compressing decades of research into instantly accessible intelligence, dramatically accelerating the time from target identification to clinical candidate.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 JNJ has been working with NVIDIA for more than a year to scale AI for use in surgery. This collaboration is aimed at delivering real-time analysis and AI-powered insights within the operating room, using advanced computing platforms to enhance surgical decision-making and training. \r\n\r\nIn October 2025, the company revealed that it is using an AI-driven simulation to train clinical teams on the MONARCH robotic platform for urology. To achieve this, JNJ is leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac and Omniverse platforms to create high-fidelity digital twins of the system and patient anatomy, enabling teams to practice robot setup and simulate kidney stone procedures in a virtual operating room. The company is also using NVIDIA Cosmos for generating accurate, physics-based synthetic data, enhancing learning and procedure planning prior to surgery.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile, AbbVie uses Palantir's Foundry platform as the data management backbone (Fusion) for its global operations. Foundry allows AbbVie to unify disparate data sources, manage complex clinical trial data, and streamline supply chains, significantly boosting operational efficiency and accelerating drug development.\n\nThese deep, transformative collaborations between pharmaceutical and AI companies are creating a powerful flywheel effect of innovation and efficiency, directly aiding the growth prospects of the healthcare sector.\n\nHealthcare ETFs to Buy\n\nLooking ahead, the global AI in healthcare market \u2014 valued at $26.57 billion in 2024\u2014 is projected to reach $505.59 billion by 2033, at a CAGR of 38.81%, according to a report by Grand View Research. To capitalize on this AI-driven healthcare revolution, one can invest in the following couple of healthcare ETFs to tap the powerful growth opportunities offered\u00a0 by big pharma stocks, especially those mentioned above:\n\nVanguard Health Care ETF VHT\n\nThis fund, with assets worth $16.2 billion, offers exposure to 398 companies that are primarily involved in the research, development, production, and marketing of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. LLY holds the first spot in this fund with 11.25% weightage, ABBV holds the second spot with 5.24% weightage and JNJ holds the fourth spot with 4.54% weightage.\n\nVHT has surged 12.3% year to date. The fund charges 9 basis points (bps) as fees. It sports a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.\n\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR ETF XLV\n\nThis fund, with assets under management (AUM) worth $39.01 billion, offers exposure to 60 companies in the pharmaceuticals; health care equipment and supplies; health care providers and services; biotechnology; life sciences tools and services; and health care technology industries. LLY holds the first spot in this fund with 15.08% weightage, JNJ holds the second spot with 8.81% weightage and ABBV holds the third spot with 7.44% weightage.\n\nXLV has soared 11.6% year to date.

The company now expects the segment to contribute nearly half of its full-year revenues, highlighting its rising strategic importance.\n\nThe growth in this franchise is largely attributed to ANI Pharmaceuticals\u2019 ACTH-based injection Cortrophin Gel, whose sales have surged 70% year over year to $236 million in the first nine months of 2025. This upside was attributed to increased demand across all specialties \u2014 neurology, rheumatology, nephrology and ophthalmology \u2014 aided by an expanded sales force and broader prescriber adoption. ANIP expects this momentum to continue, further supported by new clinical studies (including a phase IV study in acute gouty arthritis) and ongoing efforts to deepen specialty penetration. For the full year 2025, Cortrophin Gel sales are expected to reach $347-$352 million, reflecting a 75-78% increase from last year.\n\nThis strong performance is helping offset softer contributions from ANIP\u2019s newly acquired ophthalmology assets \u2014 Iluvien and Yutiq \u2014 which were added following the September 2024 acquisition of Alimera Sciences. The company revised its 2025 sales outlook for these products to $73-$77 million (down from $87-$93 million), citing reimbursement challenges and continued utilization of existing inventory at physician offices. Still, ANIP expects the franchise to return to growth in 2026, supported by expanded field efforts, improved patient access and a significantly larger addressable patient population \u2014 nearly 10x current usage levels.\n\nANIP\u2019s Competition in the Space\n\nANI Pharmaceuticals faces competition across its rare disease portfolio, particularly for Iluvien and Yutiq, where several pharma bigwigs, like AbbVie ABBV and Regeneron REGN, market well-established products. AbbVie is a key rival, with Ozurdex competing directly with Iluvien in diabetic macular edema (DME) and with Yutiq in non-infectious uveitis of the posterior segment (NIU-PS). Regeneron remains another major competitor through its Eylea franchise, one of the most widely used therapies in DME.\n\nThe primary competitor to Cortrophin Gel is Acthar Gel, which is marketed by Keenova Therapeutics (formerly Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals). Like ANIP, Keenova recently raised the sales outlook for Acthar Gel, now expecting full-year 2025 sales growth of 30-35%, up from the prior 20-30% range.\n\nANIP\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nShares of ANI Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the industry\u00a0year to date, as seen in the chart below.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, ANIP is trading at a discount to the industry.

The adoption of advanced monoclonal antibodies, biosimilars, and targeted therapies is reshaping patient management and improving outcomes.\n\nThis study report represents an analysis of each segment from 2023 to 2033 considering 2024 as the base year. Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for each of the respective segments estimated for the forecast period of 2025 to 2033.\n\nThe 2024 market was dominated by leading pharmaceutical companies focusing on biologics, biosimilars, and next-generation therapies. AbbVie remains a key player with its blockbuster drug Humira and next-generation Rinvoq and Skyrizi for IBD treatment. Johnson & Johnson, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, and Amgen have strong portfolios in biologics and immunotherapies.\n\nUCB, Biogen, and Eli Lilly are expanding through targeted therapies and pipeline candidates. Celltrion, Alvotech, and Organon are prominent in the biosimilars segment, offering cost-effective alternatives. Boehringer Ingelheim, Ferring, and Dr Falk Pharma contribute specialized gastrointestinal treatment portfolios. Competitive strategies are driven by biologic lifecycle management, biosimilar entry, patient-focused programs, and expansion into emerging markets.\n\nIn 2024, North America led the IBD treatment market, supported by high disease prevalence, strong healthcare infrastructure, and widespread biologic adoption. Europe followed, driven by reimbursement support for biologics and the rising uptake of biosimilars in countries such as Germany, the UK, and France.\n\nAsia-Pacific is the fastest-growing region, as increasing awareness, expanding diagnostic facilities, and the launch of biosimilars fuel market penetration in China, Japan, and India. Latin America and Middle East & Africa (MEA) remain emerging markets, where limited access to advanced therapies is gradually improving due to rising healthcare investment and patient support programs.\r\n\r\nRising Demand for Targeted Therapies and Biologics\r\n\r\nGrowing understanding of IBD pathophysiology is driving demand for targeted treatment options, especially biologics and biosimilars. Physicians are increasingly prescribing advanced therapies for moderate-to-severe cases, while patients seek better quality of life with treatments that reduce hospitalizations and surgery rates. The entry of cost-effective biosimilars is also accelerating access to biologic therapies globally. Combination therapy and personalized treatment strategies, often incorporating biologics with immunomodulators, are further expanding treatment approaches.\r\n\r\nChallenges: High Costs and Variable Access\r\n\r\nDespite the expanding market, challenges persist. High treatment costs, particularly for biologics and novel agents, limit accessibility in price-sensitive markets. Uneven reimbursement policies and healthcare infrastructure disparities across regions also hinder adoption. In addition, safety concerns such as infection risk, loss of response to biologics, and the need for lifelong treatment complicate long-term management. However, broader biosimilar availability, ongoing R&D in oral small molecules, and increased healthcare funding are expected to reduce these barriers over time.\r\n\r\nMarket Segmentation by Treatment Type\r\n\r\nBy treatment type, the market is divided into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis therapies. Crohn's disease represents a significant portion of the market due to the complexity of treatment and high relapse rates, requiring ongoing innovation in biologics and immunotherapies. Ulcerative colitis remains a substantial segment, with recent approvals of targeted therapies improving long-term disease management and remission rates.\r\n\r\nMarket Segmentation by Drug Class\r\n\r\nBy drug class, the market is segmented into first-line treatment, second-line treatment, and combination therapy. First-line treatments include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, and immunosuppressants, primarily used for mild-to-moderate cases. Second-line treatment, dominated by biologics such as TNF inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, and integrin antagonists, accounts for the largest revenue share due to adoption in moderate-to-severe IBD cases. Combination therapy is emerging as a critical strategy, offering enhanced efficacy for patients unresponsive to single-agent treatments.\n\nKey questions answered in this report:\n\nWhat are the key micro and macro environmental factors that are impacting the growth of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment market?What are the key investment pockets concerning product segments and geographies currently and during the forecast period?Estimated forecast and market projections up to 2033.Which segment accounts for the fastest CAGR during the forecast period?Which market segment holds a larger market share and why?Are low and middle-income economies investing in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment market?Which is the largest regional market for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment market?What are the market trends and dynamics in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa?Which are the key trends driving Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment market growth?Who are the key competitors and what are their key strategies to enhance their market presence in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment market worldwide?\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment Market: Macro Analysis & Market Dynamics\n\nGlobal Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment Market Value, 2023-2033, (US$ Million)Market DynamicsMarket DriversMarket RestraintsKey ChallengesKey OpportunitiesImpact Analysis of Drivers and RestraintsPorter's Five Force ModelPESTEL Analysis\n\nCompanies Featured\n\nAbbVieAlvotechAmgenBiogenBoehringer IngelheimCelltrionDr Falk PharmaEli LillyFerringJohnson & JohnsonORGANONPfizerTakeda Pharmaceuticals\n\nMarket Segmentation\n\nTreatment Type\n\nCrohn's diseaseUlcerative colitis\n\nDrug Class\n\nFirst-line treatment\n\nAminosalicylatesCorticosteroids\n\nSecond-line treatment\n\nIL inhibitorsTNF inhibitorsJAK inhibitorsAnti-integrinS1P receptor modulator\n\nCombination therapy\n\nTNF inhibitors + thiopurinesOther combination therapies\n\nRoute of Administration\n\nInjectableOralRectal\n\nDistribution Channel\n\nHospital pharmacyRetail pharmacyOnline pharmacy\n\nRegional Segmentation (2023-2033; US$ Million)\n\nNorth America\n\nU.S.CanadaRest of North America\n\nUK and European Union\n\nUKGermanySpainItalyFranceRest of Europe\n\nAsia-Pacific\n\nChinaJapanIndiaAustraliaSouth KoreaRest of Asia-Pacific\n\nLatin America\n\nBrazilMexicoRest of Latin America\n\nMiddle East and Africa\n\nGCCAfricaRest of Middle East and Africa\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/4hb6qy\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\r\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Should Investors Hop On?", "content": "Hims and Hers Health logo positioned with telehealthcare provider in background.\n\nKey Points\n\nShares of HIMS have seen gains of 173% and 146% this year, but they\u2019ve also seen massive double-digit corrections after each run-up in price.  The company\u2019s management was able to achieve profitability just three years after its IPO. Analysts\u2019 forecast an average 12-month price target nearly 25% higher than where the stock is trading today. Interested in Hims & Hers Health, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nMost of the health care sector's headlines are dominated by Big Pharma giants. Legacy companies, including AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Merck (NYSE: MRK)\u2014and their lineup of game-changing drugs\u2014receive the lion\u2019s share of attention. But one newcomer is making a splash, and investors looking for growth opportunities in the health space should be paying attention.\n\nFounded in November 2017, Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) went public in January 2021. By the end of 2024, the consumer-focused health platform was able to post its first year of profitability, with net income of $126 million.\n\n\u2192 Why Home Depot\u2019s Pain Could Be a Long-Term Investor\u2019s Gain\n\nWhile that figure pales in comparison to mega-cap giants like Pfizer, it demonstrates a level of discipline rarely seen among companies that are less than five years removed from their IPOs. That, combined with operations at the confluence of several high-demand industries, makes Hims & Hers Health an intriguing buy-and-hold prospect.\n\nA Turbulent Year for Shareholders\n\nFundamentally, the young company\u2019s debt management has been exemplary. That has been accentuated by a nearly 244% increase in net cash from operating activities from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\u2192 3 Smart Defensive Stocks for an Uneasy Market\n\nWhen Hims & Hers Health reported Q3 financials on Nov. 3, it missed on earnings by just 3 cents and beat on revenue, with $598.98 million representing a 49.2% year-over-year increase.\n\nIn his comments, CEO and cofounder Andrew Dudum highlighted that \u201cAt the end of the quarter, subscribers using personalized solutions grew 50% year-over-year, helping drive nearly 50% in year-over-year revenue growth.\u201d\n\n\u2192 3 Companies to Watch as Natural Gas Stocks Make a Comeback\n\nMost notably, the company\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio of 1.67 and its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52.79\u2014a marked improvement of its trailing 12-month P/E of 67.33\u2014suggests that earnings next year should grow by more than 79% from 29 cents per share to 52 cents per share.\n\nSince 2021, Hims & Hers Health has averaged annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) growth of 37.14%, revenue growth of 77.85%, and earnings per share (EPS) growth of 169.63%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite these robust fundamentals, 2025 required a strong stomach for shareholders in HIMS. The stock\u2019s performance has been nothing short of a roller coaster ride this year, featuring both meteoric rises and dramatic crashes in rapid succession.\n\nFrom Jan 2. to Feb. 19, HIMS gained nearly 173% before giving more than 63% back by April 22. By May 19, it had gained nearly 146% before plunging 36% lower by June 25. At the end of July, it had regained 60%, and at the time of writing, the stock is down another 45% from that high.\n\nHIMS Is at the Center of Multiple High-Growth Industries\n\nStill, since going public, the stock is up almost 139%. Hims & Hers Health has shown exceptionally strong growth while its management has produced balance sheets that are nothing short of admirable. The company\u2019s accessible, direct-to-consumer telehealth model has positioned it at the intersection of multiple high-growth industries.\n\nAccording to market consultancy firm Grand View Research, the sexual health supplement market is projected to enjoy a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4% from 2024 through 2030.\n\nThe\u00a0hair thinning market\u2019s projected CAGR during the same period is 10.85%, while the telehealth market is expected to grow by a CAGR of 24.68%.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Hims & Hers Health also offers compounded GLP-1 injections, which contain the same ingredients as Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NYSE: NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy.\u00a0The\u00a0GLP-1 weight loss market during that forecast period is projected to be 18.54%.\n\nAdditionally, Dudum noted in the company\u2019s Q3 earnings call that Hims & Hers Health is in ongoing discussions with Novo Nordisk to distribute both injection and oral formulations of Wegovy on the Hims & Hers platform, pending FDA approval.\n\nHere\u2019s What Wall Street Thinks of HIMS\n\nTen of the 15 analysts covering Hims & Hers Health rate it a Hold, and the stock carries a consensus Reduce rating. Still, 15 analysts\u2019\u00a0average 12-month price target is $45.27, which suggests potential upside performance of 24.51%.\n\nHowever, the current level of short interest may give prospective investors pause. That stands at a significant 37.54% of the company\u2019s float. But for those who are considering HIMS as a long-term investment, institutional ownership\u2014which remains strong at nearly 64%\u2014provides a vote of confidence.\n\nUnderscoring the smart money\u2019s bullish stance on Hims & Hers Health, over the past 12 months,\u00a0425 institutional buyers have injected $2.31 billion in inflows, compared to just 194 institutional sellers pulling out $1.17 billion.\n\nThe article \"HIMS Has Been a Roller Coaster Ride.

AbbVie pays a $6.92 annual dividend with a 2.96% yield. Realty Income offers a 5.64% dividend yield and has raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years. If you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe good news is that you don't necessarily need to try to build a portfolio that can resist everything, as that's an impossibility. What you can do, instead, is to lean heavily on dividend investments that give you something different and something steadier.\n\nWith dividend stocks, you can have income, stability, and a confidence that comes from owning companies that are going to be able to defend their payments, even during uncertain market periods. Two companies stand out in this area, with AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and Realty Income (NYSE:O) both representing two different sectors, but both stocks form the kind of resilience that is prized by income-focused investors.\n\nThe best scenario here is that each company offers a reliable dividend, plus a strong balance sheet, and each has a history of outperforming during rough market periods.\n\nAbbVie Is a Dividend Powerhouse\n\nOne of the strongest and most familiar names in the healthcare space, AbbVie, has the numbers to support the case that you should hold it no matter what is happening in the market around you.\u00a0The stock itself carries a 2.96% dividend yield as of November 2025 and is currently paying a whopping $6.92 annually, which means roughly $1.6 to $1.7 dollars per quarter, making it really hard to ignore for investors. Given these numbers, AbbVie confidently sits in what I like to call \"Dividend King\" territory, and has long provided retirees and income investors the kind of confidence few stocks can provide.\n\nThankfully, AbbVie's performance in the market backs up its dividend strength, as it's up 36+% YTD and is up 187% over the last five years. These kinds of gains, layered on top of consistent and regular dividend income, show why this stock is a staple in long-term portfolios.\n\nBest of all, AbbVie shows that it can continue to generate strong cash flow thanks to its diversified drug lineup. The company has a strong pipeline filled with products related to immunology, neuroscience, and oncology. Investors who want a dividend stock with staying power should look no further than AbbVie.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRealty Income Has a Fantastic Track Record\n\nBetter known as \"The Monthly Dividend Company,\" Realty Income\u00a0has done something that few other companies on the stock exchange can match. Having raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years speaks volumes to the kind of performance this REIT stock can provide to investors.\n\nThe current 5.64% dividend yield and $3.21 in annual dividend payouts show exactly why investors have fallen in love with this stock. The company's advantage also speaks volumes about why investors say only nice things.\u00a0Operating under long-term net lease agreements with tenants across retail, industrial, and service sectors, these agreements must pass most operating expenses to the tenant and, as a result, create predictable revenue for the REIT. This structure makes Realty Income more resistant to economic downturns than more traditional real estate investments.\n\nEven in challenging economic times, Realty Income has weathered the storm well. There is no question that it's one of the strongest long-term options for investors who want a reliable paycheck they know is going to arrive every month.\n\nWhy These Two Names Work in Any Environment\n\nUltimately, AbbVie and Realty Income operate across very different industries, but together, they can create a balanced foundation for investors looking for passive income.\n\nAbbVie gives you exposure to a defensive sector that has strong cash generation. For its part, Realty Income adds monthly income thanks to the reliability of long-term contracts, which secure revenue well into the future.\u00a0Both companies have decades of experience in dividend growth, which is good news for investors both past and present. Better yet, both companies show they can defend their payouts during market downturns and or recessions.\n\nEven though there are no guarantees, the ongoing hope, whether the market is roaring or purring, is that both of these names are going to continue to pay shareholders.\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans\n\nYou may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you\u2019d be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.\n\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Additionally, growing awareness about menstrual health, coupled with improved access to healthcare and early diagnostic tools, is enabling timely identification and management of abnormal uterine bleeding, further fueling market growth.\r\n\r\nThe global metrorrhagia market faces several challenges, including the high cost of advanced diagnostic tools and surgical interventions, which can limit accessibility for patients in low- and middle-income regions. Limited awareness about abnormal uterine bleeding in rural and underserved populations often delays diagnosis and treatment, leading to more severe complications. Moreover, the risk of misdiagnosis remains a concern, as metrorrhagia symptoms frequently overlap with other menstrual or gynecological disorders, potentially resulting in inappropriate treatment and reduced patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe global metrorrhagia market is witnessing steady growth, driven by increasing demand for effective pharmacological interventions to manage abnormal uterine bleeding. Key therapeutic classes include hormonal agents such as combined oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists/antagonists, as well as non-hormonal options like tranexamic acid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Leading pharmaceutical companies are focusing on developing advanced formulations with improved safety, tolerability, and long-term efficacy. The market is also seeing innovation in sustained-release drug delivery systems, targeted hormonal modulation, and combination therapies that address both symptom relief and underlying causes.\r\n\r\nEmerging therapies such as selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs), oral GnRH antagonists with add-back therapy, and novel anti-angiogenic agents are showing promising results in clinical trials, potentially offering safer and more effective alternatives to surgery. Growing awareness of menstrual health, coupled with increasing access to prescription treatments in emerging markets, is expanding the patient base. Moreover, ongoing research into personalized medicine and biomarker-driven treatment approaches is expected to further diversify and optimize metrorrhagia management in the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe global metrorrhagia market presents significant opportunities through the expansion of healthcare access in emerging markets, where improving medical infrastructure and rising awareness are creating untapped demand for diagnosis and treatment. The development of targeted and safer therapeutic agents, including next-generation hormonal modulators and novel non-hormonal drugs with fewer side effects, offers strong potential for innovation and market differentiation.

The company beat estimates for both earnings and sales. While sales rose 9.1% year over year, earnings declined 38% due to costs related to acquisitions. AbbVie raised its revenue and EPS guidance for 2025 for the third time this year, backed by strong momentum year to date.\n\nHowever, AbbVie\u2019s stock declined post earnings release, probably due to softer sales of oncology drugs and continued weakness in its Aesthetics unit.\n\nHowever, the stock has recovered after the Q3 dip and on Nov. 12, crossed the 50-day moving average. This may have confused investors about whether they should buy, sell or hold the stock post the dip.\n\nLet\u2019s understand the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in detail to make a proper investment decision.\n\nABBV\u2019s Successful New Drugs \u2014 Skyrizi and Rinvoq\n\nAbbVie lost patent protection for its blockbuster drug, Humira, in the United States in January 2023 and in the EU in 2018. Humira's sales are declining due to LOE and biosimilar erosion. However, AbbVie has successfully navigated the loss of exclusivity (LOE) of the drug, which once generated more than 50% of its total revenues. It has accomplished this by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications, and should support top-line growth in the next few years.\n\nSkyrizi and Rinvoq generated combined sales of $18.5 billion in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nThe drugs are seeing strong performance across all approved indications, especially in the popular inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) space, which includes two conditions \u2014 ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD).\n\nSkyrizi sales are now annualizing at almost $18 billion and Rinvoq at more than $8 billion. AbbVie expects to outperform its target of combined sales of Skyrizi and Rinvoq of more than $25 billion in 2025 and more than $31 billion by 2027. Strong immunology market growth, market share gains and momentum from new indications, such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC, as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years, are expected to drive these drugs\u2019 growth.\n\nAbbVie recently settled patent litigation\u00a0with all generic manufacturers for Rinvoq, which extended the drug\u2019s patent exclusivity by four years to 2037.\n\nABBV\u2019s Oncology & Neuroscience Drugs Also Contributing\n\nAbbVie has built a substantial oncology franchise with Imbruvica and Venclexta. Its oncology segment generated combined revenues of $5.0 billion in the first nine months of 2025, up 2.7% year over year as higher sales of Venclexta and contributions from new drugs, Elahere and Epkinly, more than offset the decline in Imbruvica sales. Some key oncology drugs approved in the past couple of years are Epkinly and Emrelis. Elahere was added to AbbVie\u2019s oncology portfolio with the February 2024 acquisition of Immunogen. These three new drugs have strengthened AbbVie\u2019s oncology franchise.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAbbVie\u2019s neuroscience portfolio is also contributing to top-line growth. Sales of its neuroscience drugs increased 20.3% to almost $7.8 billion in the first nine months of 2025, driven by higher sales of Botox Therapeutic, depression drug Vraylar and newer migraine drugs Ubrelvy and Qulipta.\n\nThe initial international launch of Vyalev in Parkinson\u2019s disease is encouraging, and the company\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease franchise, comprising Vyalev and once-daily oral treatment tavapadon (under review in the United States), is being seen as a key to growth in neuroscience.\n\nOver the next couple of years. AbbVie expects new product approvals for tavapadon and pivekimab sunirine (blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm) and pivotal data readouts for key pipeline candidates, lutikizumab, Temab-A and etentamig.\u00a0 These pipeline programs have the potential to drive long-term growth for AbbVie, while Skyrizi and Rinvoq will boost near-term growth.\n\nAbbVie on an Acquisition Spree\n\nAbbVie has been on an inorganic growth track over the past couple of years to bolster its early-stage pipeline, which should drive long-term growth. Particularly, it is signing several M&A deals in the immunology space, its core area, while also entering into some early-stage alliances in oncology and neuroscience. AbbVie has executed more than 30 M&A transactions since the beginning of 2024. In a key recent deal, it acquired private biotech, Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals' bretisilocin, a novel, investigational therapy for major depressive disorder. The agreement will strengthen its neuroscience pipeline.\n\nABBV\u2019s Struggling Aesthetics Segment & Humira Erosion\n\nSales of Humira are declining due to biosimilar erosion. The launch of Humira biosimilars in the United States in 2023 significantly eroded the drug\u2019s sales in 2024, with the decline being sharper in 2025 and expected to continue in 2026 as more plans excluded branded Humira and moved to exclusive biosimilar contracts. Humira sales declined more than 50% in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nAbbVie is seeing decreasing sales of the Aesthetics unit. AbbVie\u2019s global sales of its aesthetics portfolio declined 0.6% in 2024 and 7.4% in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nContinued macro challenges and low consumer sentiment, especially in the United States, as concerns about the economy and inflation weigh on discretionary spending, are hurting aesthetics sales. Juvederm sales fell 14.6% in 2024 and 16.7% in the first nine months of 2025. Botox Cosmetics sales declined 7.4% in the first nine months of 2025. AbbVie now expects category growth to be below previous expectations.\n\nOn the third-quarter conference call, AbbVie lowered its expectation for its Aesthetics business from $5.1 billion to $4.9 billion due to greater-than-expected market softness globally.\n\nABBV Stock Price, Valuation and Estimate Revision\n\nABBV stock has risen 31.6% this year so far compared with an increase of 14.2% for the industry. The stock has also outperformed the sector and the S&P 500 Index, as seen in the chart below.\n\nABBV Stock Outperforms Industry, Sector & S&P 500Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nABBV Stock Valuation\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, AbbVie is reasonably priced. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company\u2019s shares currently trade at 16.74 forward earnings, lower than 16.81 for the industry. The stock is trading above its five-year mean of 13.36. \u00a0AbbVie stock seems cheaper compared to other large drugmakers, such as Eli Lilly LLY, J&J JNJ and AstraZeneca AZN, following their results.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has declined from $11.15 per share to $10.63, while that for 2026 has decreased from $14.41 to $14.39 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nABBV Estimate MovementZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStay Invested in ABBV Stock\n\nAbbVie combats its share of headwinds, like Humira LOE impact, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and continued macro woes for Aesthetics. However, the company has faced its biggest challenge \u2014 Humira\u2019s patent cliff \u2014 quite well and looks well-positioned for continued strong growth in the years ahead. AbbVie is returning to robust revenue growth in 2025, which is just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE, driven by its ex-Humira platform.\n\nSales of AbbVie\u2019s ex-Humira drugs rose more than 20% (on a reported basis) in the third quarter, which was above its expectations, driven by Skyrizi, Rinvoq and neuroscience.\n\nBoosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through 2029, as it has no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade. A substantial portion of this growth is expected to be driven by the robust performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In the first nine months of the year, its total revenues rose 8.2%, in line with its expectation of mid-single-digit revenue growth. With no significant LOEs in this decade, AbbVie enjoys the flexibility to invest more in R&D to continue to acquire external innovation.\n\nAbbVie recently increased its quarterly cash dividend by 5.5%. Though estimates have declined, we believe that it is due to costs related to acquisitions, which should eventually boost growth.\n\nRising stock price, a decent valuation, expectations for continued strong earnings growth and a robust pipeline are good enough reasons to stay invested in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

It can result from hepatitis, alcohol abuse, NAFLD, autoimmune diseases, or toxins. Key symptoms include jaundice, encephalopathy, ascites, and bleeding. The global liver failure market is expanding due to rising disease prevalence, enhanced healthcare access, and diversified therapies. Innovations in transplantation, artificial liver systems, and pharmacotherapy are advancing treatment, despite challenges like organ shortages and high costs. Notable players include Gilead and AbbVie, contributing to growth with cutting-edge research and strategic partnerships.\n\nDublin, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Liver Failure Market - A Global and Regional Analysis: Focus on Country and Regional Analysis - Analysis and Forecast, 2025-2035\" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nThe global liver failure market is experiencing steady growth, fuelled by increasing awareness of liver health, improved access to advanced healthcare facilities, and a growing range of therapeutic options. Liver transplantation remains the gold-standard treatment for end-stage liver failure, with outcomes improving due to advances in surgical techniques, organ preservation methods, and immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nIn addition, innovations in supportive care, such as artificial liver support systems (ALSS) and extracorporeal bioartificial liver devices, are extending survival in patients awaiting transplants. The development of pharmacological therapies targeting specific etiologies, such as antiviral agents for hepatitis B and C, anti-fibrotic drugs for NAFLD, and immune-modulating therapies for autoimmune hepatitis, is expanding the treatment landscape. Furthermore, the integration of regenerative medicine approaches, including stem cell therapy and bioengineered liver tissues, holds promise for reducing transplant dependency in the future.\r\n\r\nTreatment options for liver failure continue to diversify. In acute cases, rapid interventions such as N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity or urgent antiviral therapy for acute hepatitis can prevent progression to complete liver shutdown. For chronic liver failure, management focuses on controlling the underlying cause, preventing complications such as portal hypertension, and improving liver function through medications, dietary interventions, and lifestyle changes. Emerging technologies in hepatocyte transplantation and tissue engineering are being explored to provide temporary or permanent liver function restoration without the need for a donor organ. The trend toward personalized medicine, tailoring therapy based on genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors, is also gaining momentum in the liver failure market.\r\n\r\nDespite advancements, the liver failure market faces several challenges. The shortage of donor organs remains the most significant barrier, with demand far outstripping supply in many countries. High costs associated with transplantation, artificial liver devices, and long-term immunosuppressive therapy limit access, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. Limited awareness of early liver disease symptoms contributes to late-stage diagnosis, where treatment options are more limited and less effective. Additionally, the complexity of managing comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease complicates treatment and increases healthcare costs. In rural and resource-limited settings, the lack of specialized hepatology centers and trained transplant teams further constrains patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nKey players in the liver failure market include major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies such as Gilead Sciences, Inc., AbbVie Inc., and Boehringer Ingelheim, alongside transplant technology providers and medical device companies developing artificial liver support systems. These stakeholders are investing heavily in R&D to improve transplant success rates, develop novel anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory drugs, and bring bioartificial liver technologies to market. Strategic collaborations between academic research centers, biotechnology firms, and public health agencies are accelerating innovation and expanding treatment access. Patient advocacy groups and non-profit organizations are also playing a growing role in raising awareness, improving organ donation rates, and funding liver disease research.\r\n\r\nThe competitive landscape is characterized by both established pharmaceutical leaders and emerging biotechnology startups pursuing novel therapeutic pathways, including gene therapy for inherited liver conditions, RNA-based treatments for metabolic liver diseases, and immunomodulatory drugs to prevent transplant rejection. As research into regenerative medicine, stem cell applications, and artificial organ development progresses, the market is expected to diversify, offering patients more tailored and potentially curative options. With continued investment in diagnostics, donor management, and next-generation treatment modalities, the global liver failure market is poised for sustained growth, improving survival rates and quality of life for patients worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe global liver failure market is growing steadily, propelled by rising prevalence of chronic liver diseases such as viral hepatitis, alcohol-associated liver disease, and NAFLD/NASH, sustained improvements in care pathways, and broader awareness of liver health. Advances in therapeutics and interventions ranging from potent antivirals and anti-fibrotic candidates to optimized transplant surgery, machine-perfusion organ preservation, and artificial/bioartificial liver support systems are reshaping the treatment landscape by extending survival and bridging more patients to transplant.The rise of personalized medicine using genomics, phenotyping, and AI-driven risk stratification to tailor etiology-specific regimens and post-transplant immunosuppression is opening the door to more patient-centric solutions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nExpanding healthcare infrastructure and transplant capacity in emerging markets, alongside telehepatology and hub-and-spoke referral models, are increasing access to advanced care.

(ABBV) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It", "content": "AbbVie (ABBV) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned +1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which AbbVie belongs, has gained 9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, AbbVie is expected to post earnings of $3.37 per share, indicating a change of +56% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. This estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.39 indicates a change of +35.4% from what AbbVie is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for AbbVie.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ABBV\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of AbbVie, the consensus sales estimate of $16.36 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.4%. The $60.88 billion and $66.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.1% and +9.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAbbVie reported revenues of $15.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.1%. EPS of $1.86 for the same period compares with $3 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.2%. The EPS surprise was +5.08%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAbbVie is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about AbbVie. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H. Watson Chair in Value Investing at the University of Toronto and was previously an Associate Professor at the Columbia Business School.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop Healthcare Stocks\n\nDividend Aristocrats2023\n\nWide Moat Stocks2023\n\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\n\nFactor-Based Stock Portfolios\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Healthcare has been one of the main beneficiaries of this rotation, with healthcare stocks having their largest quarterly inflows since Q1 2021. Eli Lilly, Merck, and AbbVie are three of the stocks leading the rotation, thanks to a variety of fundamental tailwinds. Interested in AbbVie Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nIs the artificial intelligence revolution hitting its first roadblock? For the first time since the AI boom began in 2023, the industry is starting to feel the weight of expectations, and many of the tech sector\u2019s biggest winners have been struggling amidst a volatile market. Have you checked on\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) lately? Down more than 20% in the last three months, and now only up 2% on the year. How about NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA), the semiconductor stalwart? It\u2019s still up more than 35% year-to-date (YTD), but only 3% of that advance has come since July. And looking at the Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) chart is enough to have a risk-averse investor reaching for the Dramamine.\n\nWhere have all the gains gone? Speculative assets and meme stocks had their day in the sun this summer, but the recent rotation has been to healthcare, a sector most investors left behind while chasing hot tech trends. Is this rotation a brief venture into safer water, or does it have momentum?\n\n\u2192 3 Smart Defensive Stocks for an Uneasy Market\n\nWhy Healthcare Is Surging Now\n\nDespite several breakthroughs, the healthcare sector has lagged the broader market for the last five years. Not only have healthcare stocks underperformed the S&P 500, but the AI-infused tech industry has blown them away.Chart of SPY Fund performance compared to XLK Fund, displaying how healthcare sector has underperformed compared to tech.\n\n\u2192 3 Companies to Watch as Natural Gas Stocks Make a Comeback\n\nA 34% gain over that period isn\u2019t poor, but it lags far behind the explosive rise of AI and tech stocks. However, several key factors are now pushing healthcare back into focus:\n\nPharma Catalysts: Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of GLP-1s? While these drugs aren\u2019t new, the success they\u2019ve had treating diabetes and obesity has revolutionized weight loss programs, creating a massive revenue source. The Trump administration recently\u00a0reached a deal with several GLP-1 developers to provide access to Medicare and Medicaid patients at reduced prices. Attractive Valuations and Strong Earnings: Healthcare has become undervalued, especially compared to the nosebleed valuations tech companies have received. Healthcare trades at just 16 times forward earnings, while tech is well over 30 times forward earnings. The sector also demonstrated defensive strength during the Q1 2025 bear market, further reinforcing its appeal. Sector Rotation: The AI sector appears ripe for profit-taking, with a majority of tech stocks now trading below their 20-day moving averages. In contrast, healthcare is seeing inflows not observed since early 2021. As investors seek stability, healthcare's reputation as a defensive play could fuel a longer-term rally.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3 Healthcare Stocks Leading the Sector Higher\n\nThe rotation to healthcare is still in the early innings, which likely means there are still profits to be made with the cream-of-the-crop stocks in the sector. Here are three large-cap healthcare companies leading the sector higher.\n\n\u2192 Why Home Depot\u2019s Pain Could Be a Long-Term Investor\u2019s Gain\n\nEli Lilly and Company: GLP-1 Dominance Driving Shares Higher\n\nIt was looking like a lost year for Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) until the recent rally. The stock dipped below $630 in August for the first time since January 2024, despite the success of its GLP-1s\u2014Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity. Lilly also has an oral GLP-1 tablet currently in Phase 3 clinical trials that, if approved, would be easier to scale compared to injectables like Mounjaro and Zepbound.LLY stock chart with \"golden cross\" indicator confirming a technical breakout.\n\nThe recent breakout in LLY shares was spurred by two fundamental catalysts: excellent Q3 earnings that beat both top- and bottom-lines, and a federal deal improving Medicare access to its drugs.\u00a0With technical tailwinds now supporting the breakout, LLY is reasserting its leadership in the healthcare rally.\n\nMerck: Undervaluation Reaching Record Levels\n\nMerck and Co. (NYSE: MRK) has been one of the most disappointing large-cap stocks in the sector, down nearly 7% YTD and more than 20% from its previous all-time high in July 2024. Merck is no stranger to prolonged downturns (the stock didn\u2019t reclaim its 2000 all-time high until late 2019), but the company has a diverse pipeline and a stock that's tremendously undervalued at just 10 times forward earnings.MRK stock chart displaying the stock rising above 50- and 200-day SMAs.\n\nMerck reported 8% year-over-year (YOY) sales growth in its lead oncology drug Keytruda, and total Q3 revenue exceeded $17 billion for the first time in the company\u2019s history. With a low valuation, a strong dividend, and several revenue drivers such as Keytruda and Gardasil, MRK shares could be an enticing buy for the first time in several years.\n\nAbbVie: Diverse and Innovative Drug Portfolio\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten the TV jingle for SKYRIZI stuck in your head lately, you have AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) to thank. The $400 billion pharmaceutical giant is also the developer behind HUMIRA, RINVOQ, VRAYLAR, and added BOTOX to its portfolio in a 2020 acquisition. ABBV has been one of the best-performing stocks in the healthcare sector, up more than 30% YTD, and its sales of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ have driven back-to-back quarters of record revenue.ABBV stock chart highlighting a current rally.\n\nIn Q3 2025 earnings released on Oct. 31, AbbVie reported SKYRIZI sales of $4.7 billion (up 46% YOY) and RINVOQ sales of $2.2 billion (up 34% YOY), and raised its 2026 outlook for both drugs. Despite adding these two new revenue drivers to its flagship HUMIRA, the stock still trades at just 19 times forward earnings, below both its historical average and the current sector average. With strong product momentum and a reasonable valuation, AbbVie is well-positioned to sustain leadership as the healthcare rally continues.\n\nThe article \"Healthcare Rotation Underway: 3 Stocks Leading the Charge\" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nView Comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/healthcare-rotation-underway-3-stocks-132400381.html", "symbols": ["ABBV.US", "LLY.US", "META.US", "MRK.US", "NVDA.US", "SPY.US", "TSLA.US"], "tags": ["EARNINGS", "HEALTHCARE", "SECTOR-ROTATION", "SEMICONDUCTORS", "TECH"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.036, "neu": 0.838, "pos": 0.126}}, {"date": "2025-11-19T12:40:41+00:00", "title": "3 Cash-Producing Stocks We Think Twice About", "content": "Generating cash is essential for any business, but not all cash-rich companies are great investments.

(ABBV) announced that the FDA has approved EPKINLY in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.\n\nEPKINLY is a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody designed to target CD20 on B-cells and CD3 on T-cells. In this newly approved regimen, it is administered subcutaneously with R2 (rituximab and lenalidomide), offering a fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free option for patients.\n\nThe approval was based on results from a phase 3 trial, dubbed EPCORE FL-1.  The results demonstrated that the combination reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 79% compared to R2 alone.\n\nOverall response rates reached 89% in the EPKINLY + R2 arm versus 74% in the control group, with complete response observed in 74% of patients compared to 43% with R2. Median progression-free survival was not reached in the EPKINLY + R2 group, highlighting durable benefit.\n\nSafety data indicated that the regimen was generally manageable, with the added advantage of being chemotherapy-free and suitable for outpatient administration.\n\nData from the EPCORE FL-1 study will be presented at the Annual Meeting and Exposition of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in December 2025, providing further visibility into the clinical impact of this therapy.\n\nAbbVie is collaborating with Genmab A/S (GMAB) on the development of EPKINLY. Under the agreement signed in 2020, the companies will share commercial responsibilities in the U.S. and Japan, while AbbVie will lead commercialisation in the rest of the world.

You're not the only one. Let's dig into the numbers to find out how the market might be valuing the stock right now. AbbVie\u2019s share price has jumped 7.0% in the past week and surged 30.4% year-to-date, putting its performance firmly in the spotlight and hinting at shifting investor sentiment. This momentum hasn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Investors are reacting to positive developments from AbbVie\u2019s drug pipeline and several high-profile FDA approvals in recent months, fueling speculation about future growth. Savvy market watchers also noted a recent wave of analyst upgrades, which has helped drive interest and pushed the stock higher. Before you make any assumptions, it\u2019s worth pointing out that AbbVie scores a 4 out of 6 on our undervaluation checks, which is solid, but there\u2019s more to the story. We\u2019ll break down how we arrive at that score using different valuation approaches, and later in the article, we\u2019ll share an even more insightful way to assess AbbVie\u2019s value that you won\u2019t want to miss.\n\nAbbVie delivered 45.6% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Biotechs industry.\n\nApproach 1: AbbVie Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\n\nA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today's value. This approach helps investors understand what a business could be worth based on its underlying financial strength, rather than relying on market sentiment alone.\n\nFor AbbVie, the latest reported Free Cash Flow stands at $19.9 billion. Analyst forecasts see this figure rising over the next five years, with Simply Wall St extrapolating projections up to 2035. By 2029, annual Free Cash Flow is expected to reach $32.2 billion, and ten-year projections show an increase to over $42.0 billion by 2035. These estimates suggest solid long-term growth in AbbVie\u2019s ability to generate cash.\n\nBased on the DCF analysis, AbbVie's estimated intrinsic value stands at $436.38 per share. This suggests the stock is trading at a 46.4% discount to its fair value, which could indicate that the current market price does not fully reflect the company\u2019s future cash-generating potential.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUED\n\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests AbbVie is undervalued by 46.4%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover 894 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows.ABBV Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for AbbVie.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApproach 2: AbbVie Price vs Sales (P/S)\n\nThe Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is a useful way to value profitable companies like AbbVie, especially in the biotech sector where revenue growth is a key indicator of future potential. Unlike earnings-based multiples, P/S can offer a clearer view of valuation for businesses with substantial and growing sales streams. This makes it ideal for comparing companies in the same industry.\n\nGrowth expectations and risk play important roles in determining what a \"normal\" or \"fair\" P/S ratio should be. Companies with faster expected revenue growth or lower risk profiles typically trade at higher multiples. Those facing more uncertainty or lower growth prospects tend to warrant lower P/S ratios.\n\nCurrently, AbbVie trades on a P/S multiple of 6.93x. For context, that sits just above the peer average of 6.22x, but well below the broader biotech industry average of 11.92x. On the surface, this suggests AbbVie may be modestly valued compared to its direct competitors and the wider sector.\n\nTo cut through the noise, Simply Wall St\u2019s proprietary Fair Ratio estimates what AbbVie\u2019s P/S should be by weighing up company-specific factors such as profit margin, expected earnings growth, industry trends, company size, and risk. This makes the Fair Ratio a more insightful benchmark compared to simply comparing with peers or the overall industry average.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s Fair Ratio stands at 11.50x, notably higher than both its current multiple and peer comparisons. With the market pricing AbbVie at 6.93x sales while its Fair Ratio suggests 11.50x is justified, AbbVie\u2019s shares could be considered undervalued through the lens of this more nuanced approach.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUEDNYSE:ABBV PS Ratio as at Nov 2025\n\nPS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1421 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth.\n\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your AbbVie Narrative\n\nEarlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let's introduce you to Narratives, Simply Wall St\u2019s powerful and easy-to-use tool for seeing the story behind a company's numbers.\n\nA Narrative is your personalized perspective on a company, where you link real-world drivers and expectations, such as new drug launches, regulatory changes, or patent wins, to concrete financial forecasts and an estimated fair value.\n\nThis approach moves beyond static valuations by connecting the \u201cwhy\u201d (the business story and outlook) with the \u201cwhat\u201d (forecasted revenue, profits, and margin trends) and the \u201chow much\u201d (your calculated fair value) in a clear, structured way.\n\nOn Simply Wall St\u2019s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives to make smarter, more confident decisions about when to buy, hold, or sell by comparing their Fair Value to the latest share price and revisiting their view whenever new information, such as major earnings or industry news, arrives.\n\nFor example, one investor\u2019s AbbVie Narrative could focus on relentless innovation and pipeline expansion, forecasting robust 29.6% profit margins and a fair value of $255 per share. Another could focus on patent cliffs and rising competition, resulting in much lower earnings estimates and a fair value closer to $170. This shows how the same company can look very different depending on your investment story.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for AbbVie?

These data, delivered by a regimen that's chemotherapy-free and can be administered in the outpatient setting, suggest that EPKINLY + R2 could potentially become a new standard of care.\"\n\nFL is typically an indolent (slow-growing) form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that arises from B-lymphocytes and impacts approximately 15,000 new patients per year in the U.S.ii,iii The disease is considered incurable with current available therapies.iv Patients with FL often relapse, and in some cases, the disease can transform into a more aggressive form of NHL called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).v\n\nThe Phase 3 EPCORE FL-1 study included a broad range of patients, including those with indolent to aggressive disease. In the study, EPKINLY + R2 reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 79% (HR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.13% - 0.33%, p<0.0001) compared to standard of care R2 alone. In the dual primary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR), 89% of patients treated with EPKINLY + R2 responded to treatment (n=216/243, 95% CI: 84% - 93%; p<0.0001) compared to 74% of patients treated with R2 (n=181/245, 95% CI: 68%-79%). The median for dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), was not reached (NR) among patients treated with EPKINLY + R2 (95% CI: 21.9 months - NR) compared to 11.2 months for patients treated with R2 (95% CI: 10.5 months - NR). Among patients who were treated with EPKINLY + R2, 74% achieved a complete response (CR) (n=181/243, 95% CI: 69% - 80%, p<0.0001) compared to 43% of patients treated with R2 (n=106/245, 95% CI: 37% - 50%).i\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nThe safety profile of EPKINLY + R2 in the EPCORE FL-1 study was generally consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual regimens (epcoritamab and R2). The most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions in patients who received EPKINLY + R2 were rash, upper respiratory tract infections, fatigue, injection site reactions, constipation, diarrhea, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), pneumonia, COVID-19 and fever. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (\u2265 10%) were decreased neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and platelets. CRS occurred in 24% of patients at the recommended 3 step-up dosage schedule, and was primarily low grade (19% Grade 1, 5% Grade 2). A single event of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) occurred in one patient, grade 1 (0.8%). The prescribing information has a Boxed Warning for serious or life-threatening CRS and ICANS. Warnings and precautions include infections, cytopenias, and embryo-fetal toxicity.\u00a0Please see additional Important Safety Information below.\n\n\"Today's milestone marks meaningful progress for people living with follicular lymphoma. With a bispecific-based therapy that can be administered in a variety of medical settings, patients have the possibility of accessing this treatment at sites of care closer to where they live,\" said Meghan Gutierrez, chief executive officer, Lymphoma Research Foundation.\n\nEPKINLY + R2 was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA for the treatment of R/R FL. This designation is an FDA process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s).\n\n\"With this approval, EPKINLY is now the first bispecific antibody available for patients with follicular lymphoma in the second-line plus setting. New options are needed to improve outcomes for patients with relapsed or refractory disease,\" said Daejin Abidoye, MD, vice president, therapeutic area head, oncology, solid tumor and hematology, AbbVie.\n\nIn June 2024, EPKINLY monotherapy was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of R/R FL following two or more lines of systemic therapy. With the results of the confirmatory Phase 3 EPCORE FL-1 study, the FDA has also converted this accelerated approval to a full approval. Both companies will pursue additional international regulatory approvals for the R/R FL indication.\n\nData from the Phase 3 EPCORE FL-1 study will be presented at the Annual Meeting and Exposition of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in December 2025.\n\nAbout the EPCORE\u00ae FL-1 Trial \r\nEPCORE FL-1 (NCT05409066) is a Phase 3 open-label randomized interventional trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of epcoritamab plus rituximab and lenalidomide (R2) versus R2 alone in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL). Patients were randomized to receive EPKINLY in combination R2 (n=243) or R2 alone (n=245). Patients received EPKINLY in 28-day cycles for a total of 12 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first. Efficacy was established based on the dual primary endpoints of progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) determined by Lugano 2014 criteria as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC). Additional efficacy outcome measures include complete response (CR) and duration of response (DOR).\n\nEPKINLY\u00ae (epcoritamab-bysp) U.S. INDICATIONS AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWhat is EPKINLY?\r\nEPKINLY is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with:\n\ncertain types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or high-grade B-cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or that did not respond (refractory), after 2 or more treatments.\n\nEPKINLY for the treatment of DLBCL is approved based on patient response data. Studies are ongoing to confirm the clinical benefit of EPKINLY. follicular lymphoma (FL) that has come back or that did not respond to previous treatment, together with lenalidomide and rituximab follicular lymphoma (FL) that has come back or that did not respond after receiving 2 or more treatments.\n\nIt is not known if EPKINLY is safe and effective in children.\n\nImportant Warnings\u2014EPKINLY can cause serious side effects, including:\n\nCytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is common during treatment with EPKINLY and can be serious or lead to death. To help reduce your risk of CRS, you will receive EPKINLY on a step-up dosing schedule (when you receive 2 or 3 smaller step-up doses of EPKINLY before your first full dose during your first cycle of treatment), and you may also receive other medicines before and for 3 days after receiving EPKINLY. If your dose of EPKINLY is delayed for any reason, you may need to repeat the step-up dosing schedule. Neurologic problems that can be serious, and can be life-threatening, and lead to death. Neurologic problems may happen days or weeks after you receive EPKINLY.\n\nPeople with DLBCL or high-grade B-cell lymphoma should be hospitalized for 24 hours after receiving their first full dose of EPKINLY on Day 15 of Cycle 1 due to the risk of CRS and neurologic problems.\n\nPeople with follicular lymphoma (FL) may need to be hospitalized after receiving their first full dose of EPKINLY on Day 22 of Cycle 1 due to the risk of CRS.\n\nTell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you develop a fever of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher; dizziness or lightheadedness; trouble breathing; chills; fast heartbeat; feeling anxious; headache; confusion; shaking (tremors); problems with balance and movement, such as trouble walking; trouble speaking or writing; confusion and disorientation; drowsiness, tiredness or lack of energy; muscle weakness; seizures; or memory loss. These may be symptoms of CRS or neurologic problems. If you have any symptoms that impair consciousness, do not drive or use heavy machinery or do other dangerous activities until your symptoms go away.\n\nEPKINLY can cause other serious side effects, including:\n\nInfections that may lead to death. Your healthcare provider will check you for signs and symptoms of infection before and during treatment and treat you as needed if you develop an infection. You should receive medicines from your healthcare provider before you start treatment to help prevent infection. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any symptoms of infection during treatment, including fever of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher, cough, chest pain, tiredness, shortness of breath, painful rash, sore throat, pain during urination, feeling weak or generally unwell, or confusion. Low blood cell counts, which can be serious or severe. Your healthcare provider will check your blood cell counts during treatment. EPKINLY may cause low blood cell counts, including low white blood cells (neutropenia and lymphopenia), which can increase your risk for infection; low red blood cells (anemia), which can cause tiredness and shortness of breath; and low platelets (thrombocytopenia), which can cause bruising or bleeding problems.\n\nYour healthcare provider will monitor you for symptoms of CRS, neurologic problems, infections, and low blood cell counts during treatment with EPKINLY. Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop or completely stop treatment with EPKINLY if you develop certain side effects.\n\nBefore you receive EPKINLY, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you have an infection, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. If you receive EPKINLY while pregnant, it may harm your unborn baby. If you are a female who can become pregnant, your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with EPKINLY and you should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment and for 4 months after your last dose of EPKINLY. Tell your healthcare provider if you become pregnant or think that you may be pregnant during treatment with EPKINLY. Do not breastfeed during treatment with EPKINLY and for 4 months after your last dose of EPKINLY.\n\nThe most common side effects of\u00a0EPKINLY when used alone in DLBCL or high-grade B-cell lymphoma or FL include CRS, injection site reactions, tiredness, muscle and bone pain, fever, diarrhea, COVID-19, rash, and stomach-area (abdominal) pain. The most common severe abnormal laboratory test results with EPKINLY when used alone include decreased white blood cells, decreased red blood cells, and decreased platelets.\n\nThe most common side effects of EPKINLY when used together with lenalidomide and rituximab in FL include rash, upper respiratory tract infections, tiredness, injection site reactions, constipation, diarrhea, CRS, pneumonia, COVID-19, and fever. The most common severe abnormal laboratory test results with EPKINLY when used together with lenalidomide and rituximab include decreased white blood cells and decreased platelets.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of EPKINLY. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.\n\nYou are encouraged to report side effects to the FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch or to Genmab US, Inc. at 1-855-4GENMAB (1-855-443-6622).\n\nPlease see Medication Guide, including Important Warnings.\n\nAbout EPKINLY\u00ae (epcoritamab-bysp) EPKINLY\u00ae (epcoritamab-bysp) is an IgG1-bispecific antibody created using Genmab's proprietary DuoBody\u00ae technology and administered subcutaneously.

Technological advancements in drug delivery systems and formulation technologies, including extended-release formulations and digital health integration, are driving innovation within the market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November 2023, Japan initiated a pilot program allowing the sale of emergency contraceptive pills, specifically NorLevo and its generic version levonorgestrel, without a doctor's prescription at 145 designated pharmacies nationwide. This move aimed to align Japan with over 90 countries where such medications are available over the counter. The trial was a response to longstanding advocacy for better access to emergency contraception, especially for women facing urgent needs due to contraceptive failure or sexual assault.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reported that between November 28, 2023, and January 31, 2024, a total of 2,181 emergency contraceptive pills were sold through the trial, according to a survey project report released by the ministry. The highest number of sales occurred in metropolitan Tokyo with 266 cases, followed by 231 in Kanagawa Prefecture and 169 in Osaka Prefecture. In contrast, five prefectures, including Yamaguchi and Yamagata, recorded fewer than 10 sales each.\n\nSurveys conducted among purchasers revealed that over 80% preferred the option to buy these pills directly from pharmacists without needing a doctor's prescription. Additionally, 91.8% of respondents expressed high satisfaction with pharmacist consultations, and 84.8% appreciated the attention to privacy during the purchasing process.\r\n\r\nThis market is marked by intense competition among key players, both multinational pharmaceutical companies and domestic firms. Competition centers around product innovation, brand reputation, and distribution networks, with companies heavily investing in R&D and marketing strategies to differentiate their offerings and secure market share.\r\n\r\nThe sector is propelled by factors such as technological innovation, changing demographics, and increased awareness of reproductive health. However, it faces challenges including cultural stigma and regulatory constraints. Despite these challenges, the market offers significant opportunities for growth and expansion. Companies must navigate this complex landscape and leverage emerging trends to address evolving consumer needs and preferences effectively.\r\n\r\nRising awareness and education are pivotal drivers of growth in the Japan Contraceptives Drugs Market. This trend significantly impacts consumer behavior, market dynamics, and overall demand for contraceptive products. Increased awareness and education about reproductive health enable consumers to make more informed decisions regarding contraceptive options. Comprehensive education programs, both in schools and through public health campaigns, provide individuals with detailed information about various contraceptive methods, their effectiveness, benefits, and potential side effects.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge empowers consumers to select the most suitable contraceptive methods based on their personal needs and preferences, thereby driving demand for a diverse range of products. According to the U.N., only 2.9% of Japanese women aged 15 to 49 use the monthly contraceptive pill, significantly lower than the 17.2% average across high-income countries. Additionally, the usage rate for IUDs in Japan is just 0.2%, compared to 6.5% in other high-income nations.\r\n\r\nEducation plays a crucial role in addressing and reducing misconceptions and stigma associated with contraception. In Japan, traditional views and cultural sensitivities may contribute to reluctance in discussing and adopting contraceptive methods. In Japan, only 0.9% of women use low-dose oral contraceptives (OC), a significantly lower adoption rate compared to 11.1% in the United States and 43.7% in Canada. Educational initiatives help to dispel myths and normalize conversations about contraception, leading to a more open and accepting attitude towards its use. As social stigma decreases and understanding increases, more individuals are likely to seek and utilize contraceptive products, boosting market growth.\r\n\r\nAs awareness of reproductive health issues grows, there is a corresponding increase in demand for preventive health solutions, including contraceptives. Education on the importance of family planning and the role of contraceptives in managing reproductive health contributes to a proactive approach among individuals. This shift towards preventive care drives higher adoption rates of contraceptives as people seek to manage their reproductive health more effectively and responsibly. Education about the long-term benefits of contraception and effective family planning encourages individuals to view contraceptives as an essential component of their overall health strategy.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how contraceptives can contribute to better health outcomes and more manageable family planning supports their adoption. Educational programs that highlight the role of contraceptives in achieving desired family sizes and spacing births further enhance market growth by emphasizing the benefits of planned and intentional family planning. Japan recorded a historic low of 720,988 births in 2024, marking the ninth consecutive year of decline.\r\n\r\nAs awareness increases, healthcare providers and institutions are better equipped to educate patients about contraceptive options. Training for healthcare professionals on current contraceptive methods and their applications ensures that they can provide accurate and comprehensive information to their patients. This professional guidance reinforces the importance of contraceptives and encourages their use, leading to higher market demand. Additionally, healthcare institutions often play a key role in disseminating information through community outreach and educational workshops.\r\n\r\nGovernment and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often lead initiatives aimed at improving reproductive health awareness. These organizations run campaigns, provide resources, and support public health programs that educate the population about contraception. Government subsidies and support for educational programs further enhance the reach and impact of these initiatives. As these organizations work to increase awareness, they contribute to a more informed and engaged consumer base, driving growth in the contraceptives market.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\nReport AttributeDetailsNo. of Pages82Forecast Period2024 - 2030Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024$721.08 MillionForecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030$1030 MillionCompound Annual Growth Rate6.2%Regions CoveredJapan\n\nReport Scope:\n\nKey Market Players\n\nPfizer Inc.Bayer AGMerck & Co., Inc.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc.Novartis AGGedeon Richter PlcAbbvie Inc.Lupin Limited\n\nJapan Contraceptives Drugs Market, By Drug Type:\n\nOral ContraceptivesInjectable ContraceptiveTransdermal PatchesVaginal RingsEmergency Contraceptives\n\nJapan Contraceptives Drugs Market, By Distribution Channel:\n\nHospital PharmaciesRetail PharmaciesOnline PharmaciesClinics\n\nJapan Contraceptives Drugs Market, By Region:\n\nHokkaidoTohokuKantoChubuKansaiChugokuShikokuKyushu\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/36kk7k\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\r\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

The segment has consistently delivered double-digit growth, with its contribution to the company\u2019s overall topline steadily increasing \u2014 a trend that remained evident in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nNeuroscience drugs now account for about 18% of AbbVie\u2019s topline, with the segment\u2019s Q3 sales registering a growth of 20% year over year. This upside was primarily driven by higher sales of Botox Therapeutic and oral migraine drugs Qulipta and Ubrelvy, all of which registered double-digit gains over the prior-year levels. Per AbbVie, Qulipta is currently the leading CGRP therapy for migraine prevention, with a total prescription share of around 7.5%.\n\nSales of the company\u2019s depression drug Vraylar also rose 7% year over year to $934 million, driven by steady demand across approved indications and continued positive physician feedback on its benefit-risk profile.\n\nAdditional momentum came from the recently approved Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) therapy Vyalev, which generated $138 million in sales during the third quarter, up 40% sequentially on strong uptake across ex-U.S. markets.\n\nLooking ahead, the neuroscience franchise is positioned to play an even larger role in AbbVie\u2019s growth strategy. Beyond the expected uptake of its marketed therapies, the company is preparing to broaden this portfolio with new offerings. ABBV has recently submitted a regulatory filing to the FDA for tavapadon, a once-daily oral therapy for PD backed by late-stage data showing symptomatic improvement across a broad patient group. If approved, tavapadon \u2014 expected to launch next year \u2014 would expand AbbVie\u2019s PD footprint and further strengthen the long-term contribution of its neuroscience segment.\n\nABBV\u2019s Competition in the Neuroscience Space\n\nOther bigger players in the neuroscience space are Biogen BIIB and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.\n\nDue to the steeply declining revenues of its multiple sclerosis franchise, Biogen is diversifying into novel neuroscience therapies. BIIB, along with partner Eisai, is one of the two companies that market an FDA-approved treatment for AD, Leqembi. Biogen also markets Zurzuvae, the first and only FDA-approved oral treatment for postpartum depression (PPD).\n\nJ&J markets several leading neuroscience products, led by the blockbuster antidepressant nasal spray Spravato and antipsychotic drug Invega Sustenna. Both remain key growth drivers for the company\u2019s pharma unit. In April, J&J completed the acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, which added antidepressant drug Caplyta to its neuroscience portfolio. While already approved for schizophrenia and bipolar depression, this drug was recently secured FDA approval for a third indication \u2014 major depressive disorder (MDD) \u2014 an area with significant commercial potential.\n\nStory Continues\n\nABBV\u2019s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nShares of AbbVie have outperformed the industry\u00a0year to date, as seen in the chart below.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, AbbVie is trading at a slight premium to the industry.

Furthermore, the increasing focus on early intervention and combination therapies is expected to broaden the treatment landscape for vitiligo, offering more options to address this chronic skin disorder.\r\n\r\nDespite the promising outlook, the global vitiligo market faces challenges, including the high cost of biologic therapies, limited access to specialized care in certain regions, and variability in patient responses to treatments. Regulatory barriers related to biologic approval processes and reimbursement structures further complicate the market landscape. Moreover, cultural stigma and lack of awareness in developing economies may limit patient willingness to seek treatment and hinder market penetration in some regions.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, the global vitiligo market is set to maintain a positive growth trajectory, driven by the introduction of new treatment options, evolving healthcare policies, and continued investment in research and innovation. As therapeutic options diversify and access to specialized dermatological care improves, the global vitiligo market will likely see enhanced patient outcomes and an overall improvement in the quality of life for those living with vitiligo.\r\n\r\nThe global vitiligo market will continue to evolve with a focus on personalized treatment approaches, innovative therapies, and patient-centered care models, fueled by ongoing advancements in research and healthcare infrastructure. As awareness and treatment access grow, the market is expected to expand, offering more effective solutions to individuals affected by this condition worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Topics Covered:\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nScope and Definition\r\n\r\nMarket/Product Definition\r\n\r\nInclusion and Exclusion\r\n\r\nKey Questions Answered\r\n\r\nAnalysis and Forecast Note\n\n1.

Here's What It Means for Your Investment Portfolio.", "content": "Key Points\n\nJust 4% of S&P 500 components are driving over half the index\u2019s performance. Many of the largest S&P 500 components are expensive but are generating rapid, high-margin earnings growth. Hyperscalers like Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms can stomach AI spending thanks to rock-solid balance sheets. 10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index \u203a\n\nIf you regularly follow markets, chances are you've heard of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which is a group of mega-cap tech-focused companies that have produced monster returns in recent years. The group consists of Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.\n\nYou may also have heard of the \"Ten Titans,\" which is a group I refer to as the Magnificent Seven, plus Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix. But what you may not be aware of is just how massive these companies are compared to the rest of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) components.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the Magnificent Seven makes up roughly 35% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans make up 40%, and the 20 largest S&P 500 stocks by market cap -- which would be the Ten Titans plus Berkshire Hathaway, Eli Lilly, JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, Visa, ExxonMobil, Mastercard, Johnson & Johnson, Palantir Technologies, and AbbVie -- make up a whopping 50.2% of the index.\n\nHere's what a concentrated S&P 500 means for your investment portfolio and how to navigate markets near all-time highs.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLeading from the top\n\nEffectively, the S&P 500's structure doesn't limit concentration risk. Whereas an individual investor, an actively managed exchange-traded fund, or a mutual fund may rebalance a portfolio if a handful of stocks become overweighted.\n\nThis means that investor sentiment and earnings growth can drastically impact the index's composition. Over the last few years, Nvidia went from being worth less than half a trillion to over $5 trillion earlier this month. But it also grew earnings from a few billion to over $86 billion. In this vein, Nvidia has added the most value to the S&P 500 in terms of market cap, but it has also produced the most earnings growth.\n\nThe largest companies have contributed disproportionately to S&P 500 gains. An easy way to measure that is by comparing the S&P 500's performance to the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, which effectively weights each S&P 500 component at 0.2% of the index. So, instead of Nvidia having over 350 times more influence than a company like Clorox in the S&P 500, their stock prices would have the same impact in the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe S&P 500 Equal Weight Index was roughly keeping pace with the S&P 500 leading up to 2022. But as mega-cap tech stocks recovered in late 2022 and early 2023, the S&P 500 began distancing itself -- crushing the Equal Weight over the last three or so years.Data by YCharts.\n\nThe outperformance of the S&P 500 relative to the Equal Weight has made it far more concentrated in just a handful of stocks. The concentration is even more pronounced in the Nasdaq-100, where the five largest companies by market cap (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet) account for a mind-numbing 55.4% of the index.\n\nJustifiably expensive stocks\n\nThe more concentrated the broader indexes become, the more aware investors should be when buying and holding index funds. Another risk worth monitoring is duplicated holdings. If you have sizable individual stock holdings in some of the largest S&P 500 stocks, then buying an index fund is going to give you more exposure to those names and could give you less diversification than you may have intended.\n\nAs stock prices of large names have outpaced earnings growth, the S&P 500 has become a lot more expensive than its historical average valuation -- which will put pressure on those companies to deliver on expectations. The good news is that many of these stocks can support their expensive valuations with solid earnings growth, high free cash flow, and operating margins.\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet have completely different business models. But a shared quality among all these companies is that they have more cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities than long-term debt on their balance sheets.\n\nAll five companies are supporting their accelerated spending with cash flow rather than taking on leverage that would deteriorate their financial health. So, while the boom in artificial intelligence is leading to lofty valuations in certain pockets of the market, the run-up in mega-cap names is justified because these companies have the balance sheets and business models needed to take risks.\n\nThe same argument applies to other massive companies -- like the stability and diversification of the big banks like JPMorgan Chase, the high margins and cash flow of Visa and Mastercard, or even the high-quality oil and gas and refining portfolio of ExxonMobil that has allowed the company to boost its dividend for 42 consecutive years, regardless of gluts in the industry.\n\nTake risks into account when navigating today's concentrated market\n\nWith a few exceptions, the top 20 S&P 500 components are going up because they are accelerating earnings growth, and investors are willing to pay higher prices for these stocks as they become higher quality. Paying an expensive price for a great company is a far more reasonable decision than betting big on unproven or unprofitable companies that need everything to go right to meet lofty expectations.\n\nIn sum, the S&P 500's concentration isn't inherently bad, but it does mean that the index is much less diversified than it used to be. So, investors should take caution when buying index-linked products and expect the index to be more volatile. Sell-offs in even a few key holdings could drag down the index, even if the vast majority of S&P 500 stocks are doing just fine.\n\nShould you buy stock in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and S&P 500 Index wasn\u2019t one of them.

It was not enough to impress the market, which apparently expected more from the drugmaker. AbbVie's future remains bright, though, and its dividend program looks rock solid as always. 10 stocks we like better than AbbVie \u203a\n\nEarnings season creates short-term winners and losers, companies whose shares rise or fall after they announce their quarterly updates. The good news is that among these short-term losers, there are plenty of long-term winners -- or companies that look attractive for investors focused on the long game even after a post-earnings dip.\n\nThat seems to be the case with AbbVie(NYSE: ABBV). The pharmaceutical giant failed to impress Wall Street with its third-quarter results, leading to a dip on the heels of its earnings release. However, the drugmaker is still a buy. Here is more on AbbVie's recent results and prospects.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGood results, but not good enough\n\nOn the surface, AbbVie's third-quarter results, which it released on Oct. 31, looked pretty strong. The company's revenue increased by a healthy 9.1% year over year to $15.8 billion. For context, top-line growth in the high single digits is usually considered quite strong for a pharmaceutical giant like AbbVie. Besides, the company lost patent exclusivity for its then-largest cash cow, Humira, in 2023. AbbVie's ability to grow sales at this rate, some two years after the fact, is noteworthy. On the bottom line, AbbVie's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.86.\n\nThough that was down 38% year over year, it was largely due to acquisition-related expenses, so it's not something to worry about. In fact, AbbVie even increased its guidance for the full year 2025. The company now expects adjusted EPS between $10.61 and $10.65, up from its previous range of $10.38 to $10.58. Despite all that, the market was unimpressed, likely because many investors expected an even stronger performance from the drugmaker.\n\nWhy AbbVie is a buy\n\nAbbVie has recovered most of its post-earnings losses, especially after the end of the government shutdown lifted the broader market. But even aside from marketwide movements, the drugmaker looks attractive.\n\nIt has several products that could drive solid top-line growth in the next decade. None is more important than its duo of immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. These two therapies have performed even better than management anticipated. They grew their combined revenue by more than 40% year over year to $6.9 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nManagement predicts they will reach $31 billion in annual revenue by 2027, given their trajectory and label expansions. That's significant, since AbbVie previously expected them to generate $4 billion less, about $27 billion, in sales by 2027.\n\nFurther, both medicines should continue growing well into the next decade. AbbVie recently struck deals to keep biosimilars of Rinvoq off the U.S. market until 2037. Things are looking good for the company's immunology lineup, and what's even better is that the healthcare giant expects no significant loss of patent exclusivity through the end of the decade.\n\nWith no patent cliff in sight and two fast-growing medicines, the drugmaker's medium-term outlook looks strong. But there is more: AbbVie has other growth drivers that will also contribute to its results, including Qulipta, a migraine treatment. The company is also looking for its next gem. AbbVie has a deep pipeline that it continues to expand, partly through acquisitions. In a recent move, AbbVie decided to enter the rapidly growing weight loss market by acquiring the rights to an early-stage candidate called GUB014295.\n\nWill this investigational weight loss medicine pan out? Maybe not. The important point, though, is that AbbVie is continuously innovating and should, eventually, find ways to replace its current growth drivers. Lastly, AbbVie is a fantastic dividend stock.\n\nWhat's more, the drugmaker counts as a Dividend King, a highly exclusive group of corporations that have increased their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years. AbbVie has done so for 53 straight years including its time as part of Abbott Laboratories. And since becoming a stand-alone, publicly traded company in 2013, the dividend has soared by 332.5%. AbbVie's forward yield of 3.1% is much higher than the 1.2% average for the S&P 500.\n\nAll these facts make AbbVie a top stock for long-term income seekers, especially as its shares look reasonably valued at current levels. The stock is trading at 16.1 times forward earnings, versus the healthcare sector's average of 17.9.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AbbVie right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AbbVie wasn\u2019t one of them.

It has delivered double-digit gains, on average, over the past five and 10 years. It's a great way to be quickly diversified with lots of dividend payers (and growers). 10 stocks we like better than Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF \u203a\n\nDo you want decades of passive income? Of course you do -- who wouldn't want cash just arriving at your doorstep, regularly, with little effort required? If you're young, that income can be used to boost your savings toward a down payment or can be deployed into more shares of stock. If you're in or near retirement, that income can help pay for your living expenses.\n\nA particularly effective way to invest in dividend-paying stocks is via a dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- a fund that trades like a stock and that's invested in many dividend payers.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy dividends?\n\nIf you can't help but yawn at the thought of dividend-paying stocks, check out the table below:\n\nDividend-Paying Status Average Annual Total Return, 1973-2024 Dividend growers and initiators 10.24% Dividend payers 9.20% No change in dividend policy 6.75% Dividend non-payers 4.31% Dividend shrinkers and eliminators (0.89%) Equal-weighted S&P 500 index 7.65%\n\nData source: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds.\n\nSee? Dividend-paying stocks can be powerful components of your long-term stock portfolio.\n\nDividend ETFs\n\nThere are multiple solid income-producing ETFs. I've listed some below for you to check out -- including a simple S&P 500 index fund and an ETF focused on preferred stocks, which tend to feature high dividends and little stock price appreciation. The one that seems most compelling to me is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD), and I'll soon dig into it a bit more. (Each of these funds is well worth considering, though!)\n\nETF Recent Yield 5-Year Avg. Annual Return 10-Year Avg. Annual Return iShares Preferred & Income Securities ETF 6.6% 2.28% 3.51% SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF 4.6% 12.47% 8.92% Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF  3.9% 10.01% 11.48% Fidelity High Dividend ETF  3.1% 17.85% N/A iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF  2% 12.84% 13.05% Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF  1.6% 12.18% 13.24% Vanguard S&P 500 ETF  1.1% 15.79% 14.79%\n\nData source: Morningstar.com, as of Nov. 12, 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nYou'll note a wide range of yields and trailing returns above. Before you rush to grab the fattest returns, note that they're often tied to lower dividend yields. There's generally a trade-off between yield and growth, because faster-growing companies tend to want to invest more of their earnings into furthering their growth instead of rewarding shareholders with dividend payouts -- and more established, slower-growing companies often have so much income that they can pay out a larger portion of their income.\n\nI'm most drawn to one of the funds in the middle -- because it offers a nice mix of both income and growth.\n\nMeet the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF\n\nHere are some reasons I love the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF:\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which holds about 100 stocks with track records of paying dividends for at least 10 years -- and which also seem to be tied to high-quality companies. It has a solid dividend yield, recently 3.71%, and that payout has been growing over time: Its quarterly dividend payout was $0.26 per share in September 2025, up considerably from $0.22 in September 2023 and $0.12 in September 2018. Its trailing growth rates are solid, reaching double digits for the past five and 10 years. That's close to or above the roughly 10% average annual gain for the S&P 500 over many decades (ignoring inflation). The past decade has featured above-average market gains, so don't expect that to continue uninterrupted. The coming decade may well feature somewhat lower average annual gains. The ETF features an extremely low expense ratio (annual fee) of just 0.06%, which means you'll have to pay the princely sum of $0.60 for each $1,000 you have invested in the fund.\n\nAs of mid-November, the ETF held 103 stocks, and these were the top 10, together making up 42% of the ETF's total value:\n\nStock Weight in ETF Amgen 4.82% Merck  4.37% AbbVie 4.30% Cisco Systems 4.28% Coca-Cola 4.20% Bristol-Myers Squibb 3.03% Chevron 4.00% PepsiCo 3.95% ConocoPhillips 3.87% Lockheed Martin  3.82%\n\nData source: Morningstar.com.\n\nDig a little deeper into the fund to see if it seems a good fit for you. And remember that there are plenty of other terrific ETFs out there -- including some impressive growth-oriented ETFs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

Should You Invest $1,000?", "content": "Key Points\n\nSeveral large-cap drugmakers have been climbing and are bringing the sector higher. There's also a flight to safety, as investors reallocate funds from high-flying tech stocks. These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nThe healthcare sector has been on fire in recent weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 Healthcare Sector index is up more than 6% since mid-October. That's more than seven times the gain of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the past month. And it's the best-performing S&P 500 sector over that time by far.\u00a0For investors, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT: XLV) is a great way to capture the entire sector.\n\nWhat's pushing healthcare stocks higher? Well, there are several factors behind it.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStrength in pharmaceuticals\n\nOne factor helping the sector this past month was when major drugmakersNovo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO) and Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) made big news on Nov. 6. The two companies struck a deal with the Trump administration that would exempt them from tariffs for three years and give them access to Medicare and eventually Medicaid patients for their GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs in exchange for heavily discounting the price of those named drugs.\n\nIn addition, on Oct. 30, Lilly released third-quarter results that blew past Wall Street's expectations. It also raised guidance and announced that its GLP-1 drug tirzepatide is the world's best-selling drug.\n\nAs a result, Lilly's share price has soared 27% over the past month, which has helped drag the entire sector higher. The pharmaceutical giant has the largest market cap in the sector, and the S&P 500 is market cap weighted, meaning price increases of bigger companies' stocks will move the index more.\n\nAnother drug giant, Pfizer(NYSE: PFE), struck a similar deal with the White House in late September. It will provide the company with protection from tariffs in exchange for lower drug costs. That stock is up about 4% over the past month.\n\nAmgen(NASDAQ: AMGN) and AbbVie(NYSE: ABBV) shares have also climbed in recent days.\n\nAbbVie, up more than 6% over the past week, released its quarterly results on Oct. 31, and it too bested analysts' predictions. The company has a strong stable of top-performing drugs, including immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have delivered robust sales growth. Management said it believes Rinvoq will hit $11 billion in annual revenue by 2027, and Skyrizi will reach the $20 billion mark.\n\nAnd Amgen, which has soared almost 15% in a month, reported on Nov. 4 and also beat expectations on revenue and earnings. Its cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha was recently found to cut the risk of a first heart attack by 36%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo there are several very strong performers in the health sector, particularly among drug manufacturers, which have some of the largest market caps in the healthcare sector.\n\nA flight to safety\n\nThere also seems to be a flight to safety going on, as narratives that the market is overvalued continue to dominate the conversation. And healthcare stocks have a reputation as defensive stocks when the economy or the market turn south.\n\nThe turn to a more defensive posture can be seen with the consumer staples, energy, and healthcare sectors all outperforming the technology and consumer discretionary sectors over the past week. In fact, the high-flying \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are down about 0.5% over the past week (as measured by the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF) as investors may be increasingly wary of a possible bubble in AI-related stocks.\n\nThus, it may be a very good time to put $1,000 into the red-hot healthcare sector.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?
